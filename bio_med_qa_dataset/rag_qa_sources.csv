The most common mutation types in DMD are deletions, which account for about 65% of cases, followed by point mutations at around 26%, duplications at approximately 7%, and unknown mutations at about 2%. Exonic deletions are the most frequent type of mutation, accounting for over 70% of all exonic mutations. Small mutations were identified in about 18% of cases, with nonsense/frameshift types being the most common. Mutations in splice sites were also relatively frequent, occurring in about 20% of cases. In patients with gene deletion and duplication, the rate of DMD and IMD was around 90.6%, while BMD accounted for only about 9.4% of cases. | Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes for the protein dystrophin. The most common mutation types in DMD are large deletions, accounting for approximately 60-70% of cases. These deletions often disrupt the reading frame of the gene, leading to a nonfunctional or truncated dystrophin protein. Another frequent mutation type is duplications, which represent around 5-10% of cases and can also disrupt the reading frame. Small mutations, such as point mutations and small insertions or deletions, account for about 20-30% of DMD cases and can lead to premature stop codons or altered amino acids that impair protein function. Among these small mutations, nonsense mutations are particularly common and cause a premature termination of translation.

DMD is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness, caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Eteplirsen works by promoting the skipping of exon 51 during mRNA processing, allowing for the production of a truncated but partially functional dystrophin protein.  The approval of eteplirsen was based on a small clinical trial that demonstrated an increase in dystrophin levels in treated patients. However, its clinical efficacy has been a subject of debate due to limited data on long-term functional outcomes. Some studies have reported modest improvements or stabilization in motor function, while others have not observed significant benefits. The FDA has required further clinical trials to confirm eteplirsen's effectiveness.  In summary, eteplirsen is approved for treating DMD patients with specific genetic mutations, but its overall effectiveness remains controversial. While it has shown potential in increasing dystrophin levels, more robust evidence from larger clinical trials is needed to conclusively establish its impact on long-term functional outcomes and quality of life for DMD patients. | Eteplirsen has shown effectiveness in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in multiple studies.

The development of these therapeutic options offers exciting perspectives for restoring dystrophin expression in patients with DMD and potentially reversing or blocking the pathophysiological processes of the disease such as inflammation, fibrosis, muscle regeneration, among others. | Gene therapies under investigation for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) primarily focus on restoring the expression of functional dystrophin protein, which is absent or nonfunctional in DMD patients due to mutations in the DMD gene. One approach is exon skipping, which uses antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) to modify pre-mRNA splicing and produce a truncated but partially functional dystrophin protein. Eteplirsen and golodirsen are two FDA-approved drugs that employ this strategy. Another approach involves adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene transfer, where a shortened version of the dystrophin gene called microdystrophin is delivered to muscle cells using AAV vectors. Notable examples include PF-06939926 by Pfizer, SGT-001 by Solid Biosciences, and SRP-9001 by Sarepta Therapeutics. Additionally, CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing techniques are being explored to correct DMD-causing mutations directly in the DNA sequence or restore the reading frame disrupted by deletions or duplications. Although still in early stages of development, these innovative strategies hold promise for providing long-lasting therapeutic benefits for DMD patients. | In the last decade, several gene therapies have been under investigation for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), aiming to restore dystrophin expression and improve muscle function. Promising approaches include gene replacement therapy, exon skipping, suppression of stop codons, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectorized gene therapies have emerged as a popular method for delivering these therapeutic strategies. Gene replacement involves introducing a functional copy of the dystrophin gene into patients' cells using AAV vectors. Exon skipping employs antisense oligonucleotides to modulate pre-mRNA splicing, allowing the production of partially functional dystrophin proteins by skipping specific exons in the mutated gene. Suppression of stop codons aims to bypass premature termination signals in the mRNA, enabling translation of full-length or near-full-length dystrophin proteins. Lastly, CRISPR/Cas9 technology offers an innovative approach to edit the DMD gene directly and restore its expression in affected individuals.

(2016) demonstrated that deflazacort was associated with a slower decline in muscle strength and function compared to prednisone, suggesting a potential advantage for deflazacort. However, other studies have reported no significant differences in efficacy between the two drugs. It is important to note that deflazacort may have a more favorable side effect profile, with reduced weight gain and less impact on linear growth compared to prednisone/prednisolone.

It markedly enhances the coding capacity of the genome and can increase protein diversity which plays a crucial role in controlling development and stress responses. | The process that generates multiple transcripts from the same gene is called alternative splicing (AS). AS is a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism that allows for the production of different mRNA isoforms from a single gene.

In plants, AS may also serve as a buffer against stress-responsive transcriptomes to reduce the metabolic cost of translating all AS transcripts.

This suggests that it could play an important role in helping babies recover from birth trauma or other sources of discomfort. Despite these positive findings, more research is needed to confirm whether music therapy is truly beneficial in all cases. | Music therapy has shown beneficial effects on the health of preterm infants in a neonatal intensive care unit, especially for physiological and behavioural outcomes.

However, more research is needed to further understand its effectiveness. | Music therapy has been suggested as a non-pharmacological intervention for pain management in neonates. Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of music therapy in reducing pain and distress during painful procedures such as heel stick, venipuncture, and circumcision. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials found that music therapy was associated with a significant reduction in pain scores compared to standard care or no intervention. The effect size was moderate, suggesting that music therapy can be an effective adjunctive intervention for pain management in neonates. However, the optimal type, timing, and duration of music therapy interventions are still unclear. Further research is needed to determine the most effective approach to implementing music therapy for neonatal pain management. | Music therapy has been shown to have beneficial effects on the health of preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units, particularly for physiological and behavioral outcomes. However, a study examining the effect of music intervention on neonatal stress response to venepuncture in preterm infants did not find any additional benefit. Another study found that breastfeeding could significantly reduce pain response in healthy-term neonates during heel lance, but music therapy did not enhance the effect of pain relief from breastfeeding. While there is some evidence supporting the use of music therapy for pain management in neonates, further research is needed to fully understand its effectiveness and potential limitations. It may be useful to explore how music therapy can be integrated with other interventions, such as breastfeeding or pharmacological treatments, to optimize pain management in this population. | Music therapy has shown promising results in pain management for neonates. Several studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing pain and stress levels in newborns undergoing various medical procedures. A systematic review by Hartling et al. (2009) found that music therapy, specifically live or recorded lullabies, can lead to significant reductions in heart rate, respiratory rate, and behavioral distress during painful interventions such as heel lance and venipuncture. Another study by Loewy et al. (2013) reported that music therapy reduced the need for analgesic medications and improved vital signs in premature infants receiving intensive care. Additionally, a meta-analysis by van der Heijden et al. (2016) concluded that music intervention significantly decreased pain scores in neonates during minor painful procedures. However, it is important to note that the quality of evidence varies across studies, and more rigorous research is needed to establish optimal protocols for music therapy implementation in neonatal pain management. Overall, current evidence suggests that music therapy can be an effective non-pharmacological intervention for managing pain in neonates when used alongside standard medical care. | Music therapy has shown some beneficial effects on the health of preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units, particularly for physiological and behavioral outcomes (PMID: 34919292). However, its effectiveness in pain management during specific procedures like venepuncture and heel lance is not consistently supported. One study found no additional benefit of music intervention on neonatal stress response to venepuncture in preterm infants (PMID: 31532835). Another study reported that while breastfeeding significantly reduced pain response during heel lance in healthy-term neonates, music therapy did not enhance the effect of pain relief provided by breastfeeding (PMID: 25467598).

Synthetic lethality therefore provides a conceptual framework for the development of cancer-specific cytotoxic agents. | Synthetic lethality is a phenomenon in which two or more genetic mutations interact in a way that causes the death of an organism, even though each mutation alone would not be lethal. It is a form of genetic interaction that can be used to identify potential drug targets for cancer therapy. | Synthetic lethality is a phenomenon in which the simultaneous inactivation of two or more genes leads to cell death, while the inactivation of either gene alone has no effect. It is a promising approach for cancer therapy, as it can be used to target cancer cells while leaving normal cells unaffected. | Synthetic lethality is a phenomenon in which the simultaneous occurrence of two genetic mutations leads to cell death, while each mutation alone has no effect on cell viability. This concept has been extensively studied in cancer research, as it provides a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting cancer cells with minimal toxicity to normal cells. The idea is to identify pairs of genes that, when mutated together, result in synthetic lethality and then develop drugs that target one of these genes. For example, PARP inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of BRCA-mutated cancers because BRCA-deficient cells are sensitive to PARP inhibition due to synthetic lethality between these two genes. Synthetic lethality has also been explored in other areas such as infectious diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Overall, understanding synthetic lethality can provide insights into disease mechanisms and lead to the development of novel therapies. | Synthetic lethality is a genetic concept that occurs when the simultaneous disruption of two or more genes leads to cell death, while the individual disruption of each gene does not have a lethal effect. This phenomenon has gained significant attention in cancer research as it offers a promising therapeutic strategy for selectively targeting cancer cells with specific genetic alterations. By exploiting the unique vulnerabilities of cancer cells, synthetic lethality can be used to develop targeted therapies that minimize damage to healthy cells and reduce side effects. One well-known example of synthetic lethality in cancer therapy is the use of PARP inhibitors in BRCA1/2-mutated cancers, where the combined deficiency in DNA repair pathways results in cell death specifically in tumor cells.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28649135 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21094158 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16110319 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30059974 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675556 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18586941 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864230 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16118434 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32883316 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26451775 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34050264 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34070674 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30125975 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25171417 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18789146 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21737609 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36069976 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19690570 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671773 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26085504 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20976469 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34589394 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627702 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30682083 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27113746 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24893124 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30594981 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34454516 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30971823 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34590269 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26427375 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23447678 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29421999 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26516187 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26431531 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36446128 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29171189 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22864477 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35170959 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26630128 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33795234 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31811941 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33992077,43,32,"Two genes are synthetic lethal if mutation of either alone is compatible with viability but mutation of both leads to death.

64179139690f196b5100002f,bioasq,What are the most commonly used diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy?,"The most commonly used diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy are multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). | Commonly used diagnostic tests for Duchenne muscular dystrophy include western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, multiplex polymerase chain reaction, multiplex ligase-dependent probe amplification, and complete sequence analysis. Additionally, genetic testing can also provide an accurate diagnosis of the disease when conventional methods fail. | Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing. | The three main types of diagnostic tests currently used for detecting dystrophin gene defects associated with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) include MLPA (Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification), Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Southern Blotting. MLPA, which relies on the detection of fluorescent signals generated by hybridizing two probes to target regions of the dystrophin gene, is a widely available and reliable test. NGS enables direct sequence analysis of patient samples and provides a more comprehensive picture of the mutation burden, however it may be less accessible than other methods due to its cost. Southern blot analysis allows examination of dystrophin gene copy numbers, but requires specialized equipment and expertise. As advances in technology continue, additional testing options will likely become available, including new technologies like whole exome sequencing and RNAseq, which have potential advantages over existing approaches. Ultimately, the choice between these various testing methods will depend upon several factors, such as the availability of resources and the specific needs of individual patients and their families. | Whole-exome sequencing was utilized to detect disease-causing variants in 40 MLPA-negative DMD patients. WES analysis revealed that nonsense variant was the most common type in our study (23/36 of the cases). Whole exome sequencing (WES) and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) were used to detect potential deletions in the STS and DMD genes. | Whole-exome sequencing is used to detect disease-causing point mutations in MLPA-negative muscular dystrophy patients. | The most commonly used diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy include genetic testing, muscle biopsy, electromyography (EMG), and serum creatine kinase (CK) testing. | The most commonly used diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy include genetic testing, electromyography (EMG), muscle biopsy, and serum creatine kinase (CK) levels. | The most commonly used diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy are multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and whole exome sequencing (WES). MLPA is used to detect potential deletions in the STS and DMD genes, while WES is used to detect disease-causing point mutations in MLPA-negative DMD patients and to identify carrier females.

The diagnosis of DMD typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, family history, and laboratory tests. The most commonly used diagnostic test for DMD is genetic testing, which can identify mutations in the dystrophin gene that cause the disease. Other tests that may be used to diagnose DMD include creatine kinase (CK) testing, electromyography (EMG), and muscle biopsy. CK levels are often elevated in individuals with DMD due to muscle damage, while EMG can detect abnormal electrical activity in muscles. Muscle biopsy involves removing a small sample of muscle tissue for examination under a microscope and can help confirm the diagnosis of DMD by showing characteristic changes in muscle fibers. Overall, a combination of these diagnostic tests can help accurately diagnose DMD and inform treatment decisions. | The most commonly used diagnostic tests for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and whole-exome sequencing (WES). MLPA is used to detect deletions or duplications in the DMD gene, while WES can identify disease-causing point mutations in MLPA-negative cases. In several studies, nonsense variants were found to be the most common type of mutation detected by WES in MLPA-negative DMD patients. Additionally, WES has been shown to be important for identifying carrier females and detecting potential deletions in the STS and DMD genes. In some cases, DNA testing may also involve checking for first exon deletion/duplication by MLPA before sequencing samples to detect point mutations. Overall, a combination of MLPA and WES is recommended for accurate diagnosis of DMD. | Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. The most commonly used diagnostic tests for DMD include creatine kinase (CK) blood test, genetic testing, and muscle biopsy. A CK blood test measures the levels of creatine kinase in the blood, which are usually elevated in individuals with DMD due to muscle damage. Genetic testing involves analyzing DNA from a blood sample to identify mutations in the dystrophin gene, which is responsible for DMD. This test can confirm the diagnosis and provide information on carrier status for female relatives. Muscle biopsy involves taking a small sample of muscle tissue for examination under a microscope to assess the presence and distribution of dystrophin protein. Immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence staining techniques are employed to visualize the dystrophin protein, which is typically reduced or absent in DMD patients. In some cases, electromyography (EMG) may be performed to evaluate muscle function and rule out other neuromuscular disorders. Overall, these diagnostic tests help clinicians accurately diagnose DMD and guide appropriate management strategies for affected individuals. | The most commonly used diagnostic tests for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) include serum creatine kinase (CK) testing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and whole-exome sequencing (WES). Serum CK levels are often elevated in DMD patients and can be an initial indicator of the disease. MLPA is a widely used method to detect deletions or duplications in the DMD gene, which account for a significant proportion of cases. However, some DMD patients may have point mutations or other genetic alterations that are not detected by MLPA. In such cases, whole-exome sequencing can be employed to identify disease-causing variants. WES has been shown to be particularly useful in detecting point mutations in MLPA-negative DMD patients and identifying carrier females.

CMD is caused by genetic defects affecting the dystroglial system, while sarcogylcansopathies result from defects in sarcolemma proteins such as dystrophin, alpha-dystroglycan and sarcospan. Dystroglycanopathy can be caused by mutations in the genes encoding beta-dystroglycan, lamin A/C, dystrophin itself or other partners. Sarcoglucanspathy can be due to mutations in the gene encoding one of three sarcoglycans: dystroglycan α1, β2 or γ2. | The muscular dystrophies comprise a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders that produce progressive skeletal muscle weakness and wasting. This review discusses the genetics, pathophysiology, and potential treatments of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy: Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common childhood form of muscular dystrophy. | Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD) include dystroglycanopathies, merosin-deficient CMD, collagen VI-deficient CMD, SELENON-related rigid spine muscular dystrophy, and LMNA-related CMD. Childhood and adult-onset muscular dystrophies include dystrophinopathies, limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy.

The DMD gene is located on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp21.2) and consists of 79 exons. The DMD gene encodes a 427kDa protein called dystrophin. Dystrophin is a cytoskeletal protein that connects the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix.b1tacg3087 Dystrophin is expressed in skeletal cardiac and smooth muscle as well as in the brain.b2 | The most common types of muscular dystrophies are dystrophinopathies, limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy. | The most common muscular dystrophies include Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. | Muscular dystrophies (MD) are a group of genetic disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting. The most common types of MD include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), myotonic dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. DMD is the most severe form and affects primarily boys, with symptoms appearing in early childhood. BMD is similar to DMD but has a later onset and milder symptoms. Myotonic dystrophy is the most common adult-onset MD and affects both men and women. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood and primarily affects the face, shoulders, and upper arms. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy refers to a group of disorders that affect the muscles of the hips and shoulders. While there is currently no cure for MDs, treatments such as physical therapy, medications, and assistive devices can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life for those affected by these conditions. | Muscular dystrophies are a group of genetic disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting. The most common types of muscular dystrophies include Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy, which are caused by mutations in the DMD gene, leading to the absence or reduced production of the protein dystrophin. Other types of muscular dystrophies include limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, and congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD). CMDs are a heterogeneous group of disorders that affect infants and children and can be caused by mutations in various genes such as POMT1, POMT2, FKRP, LARGE1, COL6A1-3, SELENON, LMNA among others. These conditions can present with different clinical features depending on the specific gene involved. It is important to note that while some forms of CMD may have overlapping symptoms with other types of muscular dystrophies such as limb-girdle or myotonic dystrophy, they are distinct entities with their own diagnostic criteria and management strategies. | Muscular dystrophies are a group of genetic disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. The most common forms include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), myotonic dystrophy (DM), facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs), and congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs). DMD is the most prevalent, affecting approximately 1 in 3,500 to 5,000 male births worldwide. It is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes for the protein dystrophin. BMD is a milder form of DMD with similar genetic origins but later onset and slower progression. DM, the most common adult-onset form, has two types: DM1 and DM2, both involving repeat expansions in different genes. FSHD affects facial, shoulder, and upper arm muscles and results from complex genetic alterations on chromosome 4. LGMDs comprise over 30 subtypes with varying inheritance patterns and clinical manifestations; they primarily affect proximal limb muscles. CMDs are a heterogeneous group of early-onset disorders with variable severity and involvement of other organ systems. Overall, these conditions share features of muscle wasting and weakness but differ in their genetic basis, age of onset, distribution of affected muscles, and disease progression rates. | The most common muscular dystrophies can be categorized into congenital and childhood/adult-onset forms. Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD) include dystroglycanopathies, merosin-deficient CMD, collagen VI-deficient CMD, SELENON-related rigid spine muscular dystrophy, and LMNA-related CMD.

DM1 is considered to be more severe than DM2, but it is unknown whether this applies uniformly to all features. | The two types of myotonic dystrophy are DM1 and DM2. | There are two types of myotonic dystrophy: DM type 1 (DM1) and DM type 2 (DM2). | Myotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles and other body systems. There are two main types of myotonic dystrophy: type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2). DM1 is caused by an expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the DMPK gene on chromosome 19, while DM2 is caused by an expansion of a CCTG tetranucleotide repeat in the CNBP gene on chromosome 3. Both types of myotonic dystrophy are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to develop the condition. The symptoms of myotonic dystrophy can vary widely between individuals and may include muscle weakness and wasting, myotonia (prolonged muscle contractions), cataracts, heart conduction defects, respiratory problems, and cognitive impairment. While there is currently no cure for myotonic dystrophy, treatment options such as physical therapy, medication, and assistive devices can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life for affected individuals. | Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a genetic disorder that affects muscle function. There are two types of DM: type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2). DM1 is generally considered more severe than DM2, with earlier onset and more significant muscle weakness. In contrast, DM2 typically has a later onset and milder symptoms, although this can vary between individuals. Both types of DM are caused by mutations in specific genes that affect the production of proteins involved in muscle function. Diagnosis is typically made through genetic testing, and management involves symptom-specific treatments such as physical therapy and medication to manage muscle stiffness or weakness.

In contrast, BMD patients may not show symptoms until adolescence or adulthood and have a slower disease progression. Both conditions affect skeletal muscles, leading to muscle weakness and wasting, but can also impact cardiac and respiratory function. Treatment options for both conditions are limited, with current approaches focusing on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. However, ongoing research into gene therapy and other novel treatments offers hope for future interventions that could slow or even halt disease progression. | Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are both X-linked recessive genetic disorders caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. The primary difference between the two lies in the severity and progression of muscle weakness. DMD is more severe, with symptoms typically appearing in early childhood (around 2-5 years of age), leading to loss of ambulation by adolescence and a life expectancy into the late twenties or early thirties. In contrast, BMD has a milder clinical course, with symptoms manifesting later in life (usually during late childhood or adolescence), slower progression, and a longer life expectancy that may extend into middle age or beyond. The molecular basis for this difference is related to the nature of the mutations: DMD mutations result in complete absence or non-functionality of dystrophin protein, while BMD mutations allow for production of partially functional or reduced amounts of dystrophin. Consequently, individuals with BMD experience less severe muscle degeneration compared to those with DMD.

Distal hotspot exons 47, 48 and 50 are also commonly deleted. | Distal hotspot exons 47, 48 and 50 were the commonly deleted exons. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) exon 45-55 deletion (del45-55) has been postulated as a model that could treat up to 60% of DMD patients In particular, exons 45-52 constitute a hotspot for DMD mutations. | What are the most common mutation locations in dystrophin gene in Duchenne muscular dystrophyDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an Xlinked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. The aim of this study was to determine the most common mutation locations in the dystrophin gene in Iranian patients with DMD. In this crosssectional study the dystrophin gene was screened for mutations using multiplex ligationdependent probe amplification (MLPA) and Sanger sequencing. A total of 50 patients with DMD were included in this study. The most common mutation location in the dystrophin gene in Iranian patients with DMD was exons 4547 (28). The second most common mutation location in the dystrophin gene in Iranian patients with DMD was exons 23 (20). The third most common mutation location in the dystrophin gene in Iranian patients with DMD was exons 12 (16).

The seventh most common mutation location in the dystrophin gene in Iranian patients with DMD | The most common mutation locations in the dystrophin gene in Duchenne muscular dystrophy are within exons 45-55, which is considered a hotspot region for mutations. | The most common mutation locations in the dystrophin gene in Duchenne muscular dystrophy are found in the exons 45-55 region, particularly exons 45-52. Additionally, exons 47, 48, and 50 are commonly deleted. | An exon deletion hotspot, located in exons 45-54, was observed in DMD, and intron 44 was the most frequent deletion starting point (26.5%). | Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, with exons 45-55 being a hotspot for deletions. Specifically, exons 47, 48, and 50 are commonly deleted. Intron 44 is the most frequent deletion starting point (26.5%). In-frame exon skipping of exons 45-55 represents a significant approach to treating DMD, as a large proportion of patients harbor mutations within this ""hotspot"" region. Multiple exon skipping development, particularly for exons 45-55 skipping and an emerging therapeutic concept, exons 3-9 skipping, are being explored. A deletion of exons 3-9 encompassing a mutational hotspot in the DMD gene was detected in some cases. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of understanding the mutation locations in the dystrophin gene for developing effective treatments for DMD patients. | Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe genetic disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which is one of the largest human genes. The most common mutation locations in the dystrophin gene associated with DMD are large deletions, accounting for approximately 60-70% of cases. These deletions typically occur within two hotspots: one spanning exons 45-55 and another encompassing exons 2-20. The exon 45-55 deletion hotspot is particularly prevalent, as it represents around 80% of all deletion events. In addition to large deletions, duplications account for about 10% of DMD cases, while small mutations such as point mutations or small insertions/deletions make up the remaining 20-30%. Notably, these mutations often lead to a disruption of the open reading frame, resulting in a nonfunctional or truncated dystrophin protein that compromises muscle fiber stability and function. Early identification of specific mutation locations can help guide therapeutic strategies and inform prognosis for individuals affected by DMD. | The most common mutation locations in the dystrophin gene in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are found within specific hotspots. One major hotspot is located in exons 45-55, with exon deletions in this region potentially treatable for up to 60% of DMD patients. In particular, exons 45-52 constitute a significant portion of DMD mutations. Another deletion hotspot is observed in exons 45-54, where intron 44 is the most frequent deletion starting point (26.5%). In-frame exon skipping of dystrophin exons 45-55 represents a significant therapeutic approach for DMD due to the large proportion of patients harboring mutations within this region. Additionally, distal hotspot exons 47, 48, and 50 are commonly deleted exons.

The presence of myopathic facies is highly suggestive of FSHD but it is not pathognomonic for FSHD and can also be seen in other muscular dystrophies such as facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD2) EmeryDreifuss muscular dystrophy (FSHD3) and limbgirdle muscular dystrophy type 2I (LGMD2I) CR6.Genetic testing is used to confirm the clinical diagnosis of FSHD and to determine the size of the D4Z4 repeat array. The D4Z4 repeat array is located in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q and consists of a variable number of 3.3kb repeat units CR7 CR8. The D4Z4 repeat array is highly polymorphic and the number of D4Z4 repeat units ranges from | The diagnosis of FSHD is mainly based on a DNA test using Southern Blotting and hybridization to a set of probes, but EMG and muscle biopsy can be used to rule out other diagnoses. | For diagnosing FSHD, the main tests used are DNA testing with Southern Blotting and hybridization to a set of probes. When genetic confirmation is not possible, other investigations, such as EMG and muscle biopsy, are employed to rule out alternative diagnoses. | In most cases, once FSHD is clinically suspected, the diagnosis can be genetically confirmed with a DNA test using Southern Blotting and hybridization to a set of probes. | Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles of the face, shoulders, and upper arms. The diagnosis of FSHD is based on clinical features, family history, and genetic testing. Clinical features include facial muscle weakness, difficulty raising the arms above shoulder level, and asymmetrical muscle weakness. Family history is important because FSHD is an autosomal dominant disorder with variable penetrance. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis by detecting a deletion in the D4Z4 repeat region on chromosome 4q35. This test has a sensitivity of approximately 95% for FSHD type 1 and can also distinguish between types 1 and 2. In some cases, electromyography (EMG) may be used to assess muscle function and aid in the diagnosis of FSHD. Overall, a combination of clinical evaluation, family history assessment, genetic testing, and EMG can be used to diagnose FSHD with high accuracy. | Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) can be diagnosed through genetic testing using Southern Blotting and hybridization to a set of probes. This method detects deletions of a 3.3 kb-tandem repeat array in the locus, which is the molecular basis for FSHD. In cases where genetic confirmation is not possible, other investigations such as electromyography (EMG) and muscle biopsy may be needed to rule out other diagnoses. A non-radioactive protocol has been developed that simplifies the standard Southern blot-based DNA test by requiring only a simple PCR probe synthesis and labeling procedure, thus making it more convenient and faster. Overall, genetic testing using Southern Blotting remains the most reliable diagnostic tool for FSHD, while EMG and muscle biopsy are used when genetic confirmation is not possible or inconclusive. | Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is diagnosed using a combination of clinical evaluation, genetic testing, and muscle imaging. The gold standard for FSHD diagnosis is genetic testing, which involves analyzing the D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4q35. Two types of FSHD have been identified: FSHD1 and FSHD2. In FSHD1, there is a contraction of the D4Z4 repeat array, while in FSHD2, there are mutations in the SMCHD1 gene along with hypomethylation of the D4Z4 region. Both types lead to the aberrant expression of the DUX4 gene in skeletal muscles.  In addition to genetic testing, muscle imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound can be used to assess muscle involvement and provide supportive information for diagnosis. These imaging modalities help identify characteristic patterns of muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration specific to FSHD.  Furthermore, clinicians may perform a detailed neurological examination to evaluate muscle strength and function. Electromyography (EMG) can also be employed to assess muscle electrical activity and detect myopathic changes consistent with FSHD. However, it should be noted that EMG findings are not specific to FSHD and may only serve as an adjunct diagnostic tool alongside genetic testing and muscle imaging. | The diagnosis of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) primarily involves genetic testing using Southern Blotting and hybridization to a set of probes.

In eukaryotes, a well-characterized riboswitch senses the vitamin B1 derivative TPP (thiamine pyro-phosphate). | Metabolite-sensing mRNAs are involved in a process known as riboswitch-mediated gene regulation. Riboswitches are RNA elements that can bind small molecules, such as metabolites, and change their conformation to regulate gene expression. Metabolite-sensing mRNAs contain riboswitches in their untranslated regions (UTRs), which allow them to sense changes in intracellular metabolite concentrations and modulate the translation or stability of the mRNA. This mechanism is particularly important for regulating metabolic pathways, where the availability of specific metabolites can affect the expression of genes involved in those pathways. For example, in bacteria, riboswitches have been identified that control the expression of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis, vitamin biosynthesis, and sugar metabolism. The discovery of riboswitches has opened up new avenues for understanding how cells respond to changes in their environment and has potential applications for developing novel antibiotics and other therapeutics that target these regulatory elements. | The process involving metabolite-sensing mRNAs to control gene expression is known as riboswitch regulation. Riboswitches are structured RNA elements typically found in the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs that can directly bind to small metabolites or ions.

The incidence of FSHD varies widely depending on the population studied and the diagnostic criteria used. In general, it is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 8,000 individuals worldwide. However, recent studies suggest that this number may be an underestimate due to underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis. FSHD can present with a wide range of symptoms and severity, making diagnosis challenging. It is caused by a deletion or mutation in the D4Z4 repeat region on chromosome 4q35, leading to abnormal expression of genes involved in muscle development and function. While there is currently no cure for FSHD, management strategies such as physical therapy and assistive devices can help improve quality of life for affected individuals. Ongoing research into the underlying mechanisms of FSHD may lead to new treatments in the future. | Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) is a relatively common genetic disorder with an incidence of approximately 1 in 8000 individuals worldwide. The prevalence of FSHD is around 4 per 100,000 people. Although FSHD can cause significant muscle weakness and atrophy, it does not typically affect overall lifespan. It is important to note that the severity of symptoms can vary widely among affected individuals, even within families with the same genetic mutation. Early diagnosis and management by a multidisciplinary team can help improve quality of life for those living with FSHD. | Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a genetic muscle disorder characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy of the facial, shoulder, and upper arm muscles. The incidence of FSHD varies across different populations, but it is generally considered to be one of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy. Estimates suggest that FSHD affects approximately 1 in 20,000 individuals worldwide. However, these numbers may vary due to differences in diagnostic criteria and reporting methods among various studies. FSHD is caused by mutations in the DUX4 gene located on chromosome 4q35, which leads to the production of a toxic protein that damages muscle cells. There are two types of FSHD: type 1 (FSHD1), which accounts for about 95% of cases and is associated with a specific genetic deletion; and type 2 (FSHD2), which is less common and results from mutations affecting the regulation of the DUX4 gene. Early diagnosis and management are crucial for improving patients' quality of life and slowing disease progression. | The incidence of Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) varies in different studies.

Clinicians should choose the most appropriate tool based on the patient's age, developmental stage, medical condition, and type of procedure being performed. Additionally, it is recommended that pain assessment be performed regularly during painful procedures and that appropriate interventions be implemented based on the results of the assessment. | The most common pain scales used to measure pain in neonates include the Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised (PIPP-R), Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), Neonatal Pain, Agitation, and Sedation Scale (N-PASS), and the Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS). These scales have been validated as reliable measures of pain in infants undergoing painful procedures such as heel lances and venepunctures. Bedside nurses have been trained to use these scales to assess pain, agitation, and sedation in chronically ventilated and medically fragile infants. The correlation between changes in cerebral oxygenation and pain scores measured by NIPS and PIPP-R has also been evaluated. Overall, these pain scales are considered essential tools for assessing pain in neonates and improving their care. | The most common pain scales used to measure pain in neonates include the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), and the Crying, Requires oxygen, Increased vital signs, Expression, Sleeplessness (CRIES) scale. The PIPP is a widely used multidimensional tool that assesses behavioral, physiological, and contextual indicators of pain in preterm and term infants. It incorporates gestational age, heart rate, oxygen saturation levels, brow bulge, eye squeeze, and nasolabial furrow to generate a score ranging from 0 to 21. The NIPS evaluates facial expression, cry patterns, breathing patterns, arm and leg movements, and state of arousal to produce a score between 0 and 7. The CRIES scale is designed for postoperative pain assessment in neonates aged 0-6 months; it measures crying characteristics, need for supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation above 95%, changes in heart rate or blood pressure compared to baseline values, facial expressions of pain or grimacing during rest or movement-induced stressors like diaper changes or repositioning maneuvers as well as sleeplessness or agitation with scores ranging from 0 to 10. These scales are essential tools for healthcare professionals to accurately assess and manage neonatal pain effectively. | The most common pain scales used to measure pain in neonates include the Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised (PIPP-R), Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS), Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), and Neonatal Pain, Agitation, and Sedation Scale (N-PASS). These tools have been validated for assessing pain in infants and are widely used in clinical settings. For instance, N-PASS and NIPS have been employed by bedside nurses for pain/agitation and sedation assessments in a sample of 88 infants, including chronically ventilated, medically fragile infants. Additionally, the correlation between NIPS and PIPP-R with changes in cerebral oxygenation during acute painful procedures has been evaluated. The reliability, validity, and clinical utility of NFCS, DAN scale, NIPS, and PIPP have also been assessed in premature infants undergoing heel blood collection. These scales serve as a cornerstone in neonatal pain assessment and help healthcare professionals monitor and manage pain effectively in this vulnerable population.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35410609 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35362716 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36271296 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36291504 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599608 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29282767 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20976299 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16885171 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29945293 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18446656 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14747965 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26553356 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9535312 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32401971 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32801846,15,17,"The tools used to control pain in infants in the article included PIPP,NFCS,NIPS AND NPASS. | The Neonatal Pain, Agitation, and Sedation Scale (N-PASS) and the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) are valid measures of pain."

Several studies have investigated the relationship between salivary cortisol levels and pain in neonates, with mixed results. Some studies have found a positive correlation between salivary cortisol levels and pain, while others have not found any significant association. One possible explanation for these discrepancies is that salivary cortisol levels may be influenced by factors other than pain, such as stress or circadian rhythm. Additionally, there are limitations to using salivary cortisol as a pain biomarker, including the need for multiple samples over time and the potential for variability in collection methods. Overall, while salivary cortisol shows promise as a non-invasive method for assessing pain in neonates, further research is needed to fully understand its utility and limitations in this population. | The study observed an increase in salivary cortisol (SC) concentrations in response to painful stimulus, indicating that SC can be used as an objective parameter to assess pain in neonates. The presence of a correlation between Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) scores and SC increase further supports this conclusion. Salivary cortisol measurement is non-invasive and has the potential to provide a reliable and valid measure of pain in neonates, which is particularly important given the challenges associated with assessing pain in this population. This finding could have significant implications for clinical practice, as it may lead to improved pain management strategies for neonates. However, further research is needed to validate these findings and determine the optimal use of salivary cortisol measurement in clinical settings. | Salivary cortisol can be used as a non-invasive biomarker to evaluate pain in neonates. Several studies have demonstrated that salivary cortisol levels increase in response to painful stimuli or stressors in newborns, such as heel lance procedures and circumcision. This method offers advantages over traditional pain assessment tools, which often rely on subjective behavioral and physiological indicators that may not accurately reflect the infant's pain experience. Salivary cortisol sampling is easy to collect, minimally invasive, and causes minimal discomfort for the neonate. However, it is important to note that factors like gestational age, time of day, and previous exposure to stressors can influence cortisol levels. Therefore, while salivary cortisol has shown promise as a tool for evaluating neonatal pain, it should be used in conjunction with other established pain assessment methods to ensure accurate evaluation of an infant's pain experience. | Yes, salivary cortisol (SC) can be used to evaluate pain in neonates. A study observed an increase in SC concentrations in response to painful stimuli, and a correlation was found between Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) scores and the increase in SC levels.

Dystroglycanopathies are caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the synthesis of the glycogen storage protein alpha-dystroglycan, which links muscle fibers together. Merosin-deficienct CMD results from defects in the gene coding for the laminin alpha chain. Congenital collagen VI- deficiency CMD is due to a defect in a gene encoding a type II collagen precursor, leading to disturbed development of the tendons and ligaments. Finally, SELENO-related rigid spine muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations in the seleno-oxidase 1 gene, resulting in a defective enzyme that controls signaling pathways related to muscle contraction and growth. | Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD) can be divided into two main groups based on their onset; childhood-onset CMDs tend to occur earlier than adulthood-onset CMDs.  Childhood-onset CMDs can further be divided into four distinct categories depending upon the specific gene defect causing them. Dystroglycanopathies, which affect muscles and nerves, account for about 10% to 15% of childhood CMD cases. Merosin- deficient CMD accounts for 5% to 7%, while congenital collagen VI-deficiency CMD occurs at an even lower frequency. Lastly, SELENON-related rigidity spine muscular dystrophy affects a smaller subset of CMD patients. | The congenital muscular dystrophies are a diverse group of diseases characterized by hypotonia, weakness, dystrophic changes on muscle biopsies, and usually present within the first few months of life.

The congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) are a group of genetically and clinically heterogeneous hereditary myopathies with preferentially autosomal recessive inheritance, that are characterized by congenital hypotonia, delayed motor development and early onset of progressive muscle weakness associated with dystrophic pattern on muscle biopsy. The collagen VI related muscular dystrophies (COL6-RD), Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) and Bethlem myopathy (BM) are among the most common congenital muscular dystrophies and are characterized by distal joint laxity and a combination of distal and proximal joint contractures. | The most common congenital muscular dystrophies include laminin α-2 deficiency CMD, collagen VI-related CMD, and α-dystroglycan-related CMD. Other forms include Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, fukutin-related proteinopathy, and rigid spine syndrome. | The most common congenital muscular dystrophies are:  1. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) 2. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) 3. Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) 4. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 5. Myotonic dystrophy (DM) 6. Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) | The most common congenital muscular dystrophies are dystroglycanopathies, merosin-deficient CMD, collagen VI-deficient CMD, SELENON-related rigid spine muscular dystrophy, and LMNA-related CMD. | The most common congenital muscular dystrophies include dystroglycanopathies, merosin-deficient CMD, collagen VI-deficient CMD, SELENON-related rigid spine muscular dystrophy, and LMNA-related CMD. | Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) are a group of inherited muscle disorders that typically present at birth or in early infancy. The most common types of CMDs include:   1. Collagen VI-related dystrophies: These are caused by mutations in the genes that encode for collagen VI proteins, which are important components of the extracellular matrix in muscle tissue. Patients with these types of CMDs often have muscle weakness and joint contractures.  2. Laminin alpha-2-related dystrophies: These are caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene, which encodes for laminin alpha-2 protein. Patients with these types of CMDs often have severe muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency.  3. Dystroglycanopathies: These are caused by mutations in genes that affect the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, a protein that is important for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells. Patients with these types of CMDs often have brain abnormalities in addition to muscle weakness.  4. Rigid spine syndrome: This is caused by mutations in the SEPN1 gene, which encodes for selenoprotein N. Patients with this type of CMD often have spinal rigidity and respiratory insufficiency.  5. Nemaline myopathy: This is caused by mutations in genes that affect the structure and function of skeletal muscle fibers. Patients with this type of CMD often have muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency.  Overall, early diagnosis and management can improve outcomes for patients with CMDs, but treatment options remain limited and largely supportive. | Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD) are a group of inherited muscle disorders that manifest at birth or in early infancy. The most common types of CMD include dystroglycanopathies, merosin-deficient CMD, collagen VI-deficient CMD, SELENON-related rigid spine muscular dystrophy, and LMNA-related CMD. Dystroglycanopathies are the most frequent form of CMD and are caused by mutations in genes involved in the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. Merosin-deficient CMD is characterized by a lack of laminin-alpha2 protein in muscle fibers. Collagen VI-deficient CMD is caused by mutations in one of the three genes encoding collagen VI proteins. SELENON-related rigid spine muscular dystrophy is a rare form of CMD caused by mutations in the SEPN1 gene. Finally, LMNA-related CMD is caused by mutations in the LMNA gene encoding lamin A/C proteins. Early diagnosis and management are crucial for improving outcomes for individuals with these conditions. | Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) are a group of genetically and clinically heterogeneous muscle disorders characterized by muscle weakness and hypotonia from birth or early infancy. The most common forms of CMD include Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD), Merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A), Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), and Muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB). UCMD is caused by mutations in the COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3 genes, which affect collagen VI production. MDC1A results from mutations in the LAMA2 gene, leading to a deficiency of laminin-α2 protein. WWS, FCMD, and MEB are classified as alpha-dystroglycanopathies due to defects in glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan; they are caused by mutations in different genes such as POMT1, POMT2, FKTN, and POMGNT1. These conditions present with varying degrees of muscle weakness, joint contractures, and central nervous system involvement. Early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management can help improve the quality of life for individuals affected by these disorders. | The most common congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD) encompass a group of genetically and clinically heterogeneous disorders characterized by muscle weakness and hypotonia from birth or early infancy. These include dystroglycanopathies, which are caused by defects in the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan; merosin-deficient CMD, also known as laminin alpha-2 deficient CMD, resulting from mutations in the LAMA2 gene; collagen VI-deficient CMD, associated with mutations in the genes encoding collagen VI (COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3); SELENON-related rigid spine muscular dystrophy, caused by mutations in the SELENON gene; and LMNA-related CMD, linked to mutations in the LMNA gene encoding lamin A/C proteins. Each of these subtypes presents with varying clinical features and severity but shares the hallmark symptoms of muscle weakness and hypotonia.

FSHD affects facial muscles, muscles that fix the scapula, and muscles overlying the humerus. The unique feature of each form of FSHD is due to specific genetic mutations. Understanding the central role of DUX4 has led to ongoing research into potential disease-modifying treatments. There are several validated outcome measures used in clinical trials, including MRI, 6-minute walk test, FSHD Composite Outcome Measure,reachable workspace, electrical impedance myography, and the FSHD Health Index. | There are two types of the disease: FSHD1 (MIM:158900) and FSHD2 (MIM: 158901), which have different genetic causes but are phenotypically indistinguishable. In recent years, the advances of knowledge in clinical, genetic and epigenetic features of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) allowed the identification of two forms of FSHD, the classical autosomal dominant FSHD type 1, and FSHD type 2 characterized by an identical clinical phenotype but associated with a different (epi)genetic defect.In the large majority of FSHD1 patients, the identification of D4Z4 pathogenic contraction on a permissive chromosome 4 is sufficient for diagnosis, while FSHD2 diagnosis is complicated by the fact that the genetic defect associated with this disease is not known yet and a complete D4Z4 genotype and a D4Z4 specific methylation test are required. This article describes the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, molecular pathogenesis, and treatment of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD).FSHD comprises two genetically distinct types that converge on a common downstream pathway of the expression of the toxic protein DUX4. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD: MIM#158900) is a common myopathy with marked but largely unexplained clinical inter- and intra-familial variability. Approximately 95% of patients have FSHD type 1 (FSHD1), in which loss of DNA repetitive elements (D4Z4 repeats) in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q causes decreased methylation and epigenetic derepression of DUX4, a gene contained within each D4Z4 repeat.

While both types have the same clinical phenotype, they have different (epi)genetic defects. | FSHD1 is caused by a genetic mutation in the DUX4 gene, while FSHD2 is caused by a genetic mutation in the SMCHD1 gene. FSHD1 is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting in the face, shoulder blades, and upper arms, while FSHD2 is characterized by milder muscle weakness and wasting in the same areas. FSHD1 is more common than FSHD2. | Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 1 (FSHD1) is caused by a deletion of 3.3 kb of DNA in the D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4q35.

FSHD can be classified into two types: FSHD1 and FSHD2. The main difference between these two types is the genetic cause of the disease. FSHD1 is caused by a deletion in a region of chromosome 4 called D4Z4, while FSHD2 is caused by mutations in a gene called SMCHD1 on chromosome 18.   FSHD1 is more common than FSHD2 and tends to have an earlier onset and more severe symptoms. In addition to facial and upper body muscle weakness, individuals with FSHD1 may also experience hearing loss and retinal abnormalities. On the other hand, FSHD2 typically has a later onset and milder symptoms, although this can vary among individuals.  Diagnosis of FSHD involves genetic testing to determine whether there are changes in the D4Z4 region or mutations in the SMCHD1 gene. While there is currently no cure for FSHD, treatment options such as physical therapy and assistive devices can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life for affected individuals. | Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles of the face, shoulders, and upper arms. There are two types of FSHD: type 1 (FSHD1) and type 2 (FSHD2). FSHD1 is caused by a deletion on chromosome 4q, which leads to hypomethylation and derepression of DUX4. In contrast, FSHD2 is caused by mutations in SMCHD1, resulting in hypomethylation of the same subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q and derepression of DUX4. Although both types have similar clinical presentations, they have different genetic causes. Understanding these differences is important for accurate diagnosis and treatment strategies for patients with FSHD. | Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) is a genetic muscle disorder characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy of facial, shoulder, and upper arm muscles. FSHD has two main subtypes: FSHD1 and FSHD2. The primary difference between these subtypes lies in their genetic causes. FSHD1, the more common form, is caused by a contraction of the D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4q35, leading to the aberrant expression of the DUX4 gene. In contrast, FSHD2 results from mutations in the SMCHD1 gene on chromosome 18p11.32, which also leads to misregulation of DUX4 expression but through an epigenetic mechanism involving DNA methylation. Both types share similar clinical features; however, disease onset tends to be earlier and more severe in FSHD1 compared to FSHD2. Additionally, while FSHD1 follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with nearly complete penetrance, FSHD2 exhibits a more complex digenic inheritance pattern requiring both SMCHD1 mutation and specific permissive haplotypes on chromosome 4q35. Despite these differences in genetic etiology and inheritance patterns, both forms ultimately converge on dysregulated DUX4 expression as the key molecular driver underlying muscle pathology in FSHD. | Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) is a genetic disorder with two types, FSHD1 and FSHD2, which are phenotypically indistinguishable but have different genetic causes. FSHD1 is due to a deletion on chromosome 4q, leading to hypomethylation and derepression of the DUX4 gene. This occurs through partial deletion of the D4Z4 repeats on the 4th chromosome, affecting the expression of DUX4. On the other hand, FSHD2 is caused by mutations in the SMCHD1 gene, which encodes a protein that regulates chromatin methylation status. These mutations result in hypomethylation of the same subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q and derepression of DUX4 as well.

However, recent studies focusing on the quantitative nature of the accessibility signal reveal subtle differences between active enhancers and their different inactive counterparts: the closed silenced state and the accessible primed and repressed states.

In addition, another study has shown that euchromatin and heterochromatin can have very similar accessibilities, suggesting that transcription factors can penetrate heterochromatin. Together, these results show that many gene expression changes can happen independently of changes in the accessibility of local chromatin. | Accessible enhancers are DNA sequences that can regulate gene expression by binding to transcription factors and promoting the recruitment of RNA polymerase. However, not all accessible enhancers are necessarily active. In fact, recent studies have shown that many accessible enhancers may be in a primed but inactive state, waiting for specific signals or conditions to become fully active. This is supported by evidence showing that some enhancers are only activated under certain cellular contexts or developmental stages. Additionally, it has been observed that some enhancers may be accessible but lack the necessary chromatin modifications or co-factors required for activation. Therefore, while accessibility is a necessary prerequisite for enhancer activity, it does not guarantee it.

The condition is caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, which encodes for survival motor neuron protein (SMN). This protein is essential for the survival and function of motor neurons. In individuals with SMA, there is a deficiency of SMN protein due to mutations in the SMN1 gene. The severity of SMA depends on the number of copies of a related gene called SMN2, which can partially compensate for the loss of SMN1. However, even with multiple copies of SMN2, there is still a significant reduction in SMN protein levels, leading to motor neuron degeneration and muscle weakness.

The SMN1 gene encodes the SMN protein, which plays a crucial role in the maintenance and function of motor neurons. In individuals with SMA, insufficient levels of functional SMN protein lead to progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, resulting in muscle weakness and atrophy. There are four main types of SMA (type I-IV), classified based on age of onset and severity of symptoms. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that both parents must be carriers of the mutated gene for their child to be affected.

Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. | The hallmarks of cancer are a set of characteristics that distinguish cancer cells from normal cells, as proposed by Douglas Hanahan and Robert Weinberg in their seminal paper published in 2000. These hallmarks include: 1) sustained proliferative signaling, which allows cancer cells to continuously divide and grow; 2) evasion of growth suppressors, enabling them to bypass cellular mechanisms that inhibit uncontrolled growth; 3) resistance to cell death, allowing them to avoid apoptosis or programmed cell death; 4) replicative immortality, granting them the ability to maintain telomeres and divide indefinitely; 5) induction of angiogenesis, promoting the formation of new blood vessels for nutrient supply; and 6) activation of invasion and metastasis, enabling the spread of cancer cells to other tissues. In a later update in 2011, two emerging hallmarks were added: 7) reprogramming of energy metabolism, which shifts cellular metabolism towards aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect); and 8) evading immune destruction by suppressing anti-tumor immune responses. Additionally, two enabling characteristics were identified: genome instability and mutation, leading to genetic alterations that drive cancer progression; and tumor-promoting inflammation, which supports tumor growth and survival.

Mutations in several genes have been associated with EDMD, including EMD, LMNA, SYNE1, SYNE2, FHL1, and TMEM43. The EMD gene provides instructions for making a protein called emerin, which is important for maintaining the structure of the nucleus in muscle cells. Mutations in this gene account for about half of all cases of EDMD. The LMNA gene provides instructions for making lamin A/C proteins that are also involved in nuclear structure maintenance. Mutations in this gene account for another 10-15% of EDMD cases. SYNE1 and SYNE2 genes provide instructions to make nesprin-1 and nesprin-2 proteins respectively which are involved in connecting the nucleus to the cytoskeleton within muscle cells. Mutations in these genes can cause EDMD as well. FHL1 gene mutations have been linked to X-linked EDMD while TMEM43 mutations have been associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) with left ventricular involvement and/or conduction disease (LVC). Understanding the genetic basis of EDMD can help with diagnosis and treatment options for affected individuals. | Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a rare inherited muscular disorder that affects humero-peroneal muscles, early joint contractures, and cardiomyopathy with conduction defects. Autosomal dominant and recessive forms are caused by mutations in the lamin A/C gene, while the X-linked recessive form is caused by mutations in the EMD (or STA) gene. Other genes associated with EDMD include SYNE1, SYNE2, FHL1, TMEM43, SUN1, SUN2, and TTN. The LINC components emerin, lamin A/C, SUN1, SUN2, nesprin-1 and nesprin-2 interact with each other at the NE and also with other binding partners including actin filaments and B-type lamins. Mutations in these genes can lead to muscle weakness, early contractures, cardiac conduction abnormalities and cardiomyopathy. However, only approximately 46% of EDMD patients can be linked to genes of LINC and non-LINC components pointing to further genes involved in the pathology of EDMD. Recently identified candidate genes include LUMA (TMEM43), encoding a binding partner of emerin and lamins. Early diagnosis of EDMD is important due to frequent life-threatening cardiac complications associated with this disease. | Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness, joint contractures, and cardiac abnormalities. Three main genes have been identified to be associated with EDMD: EMD, LMNA, and FHL1. Mutations in the EMD gene, which encodes emerin protein, are responsible for X-linked recessive EDMD (EDMD1). The LMNA gene encodes lamin A/C proteins and is associated with autosomal dominant (EDMD2) and autosomal recessive (EDMD3) forms of the disease. Lastly, mutations in the FHL1 gene, encoding four-and-a-half LIM domains 1 protein, have been linked to X-linked dominant EDMD (EDMD4). These proteins play crucial roles in maintaining nuclear structure and function as well as regulating gene expression. Disruptions in these genes lead to impaired muscle cell function and contribute to the development of EDMD symptoms. | Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD) is a rare muscular disorder with various genetic causes. The autosomal dominant and recessive forms of EDMD are caused by mutations in the lamin A/C gene, while the X-linked recessive form is due to mutations in the EMD (or STA) gene, which encodes emerin. Other components of the LINC complex, such as lamins A/C and small isoforms of nesprin-1 and nesprin-2, have also been associated with EDMD. Additionally, LUMA (TMEM43), a binding partner of emerin and lamins, has been implicated in atypical EDMD.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide an important avenue for undertaking an agnostic evaluation of the association between common genetic variants and the risk of disease. Recent advances in our understanding of human genetic variation and the technology to measure such variation have made GWAS feasible. Over the past few years, a multitude of GWAS has identified and replicated many associated variants. These associations could reveal the molecular mechanisms altered in common complex diseases and result in the identification of novel drug targets. | Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a type of genetic study that aims to identify genetic variations associated with particular diseases or traits. GWAS analyze the entire genome of large groups of people to identify common genetic variants that may be associated with a particular disease or trait. These studies have been successful in identifying thousands of genetic variants associated with various diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. GWAS can also provide insights into the underlying biological mechanisms of these diseases and help identify potential targets for drug development. However, it is important to note that GWAS only identify associations between genetic variants and diseases or traits and do not necessarily establish causality. Additionally, GWAS often require large sample sizes to achieve statistical significance and may not capture rare genetic variants that may also contribute to disease risk. | Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a powerful research approach used to identify associations between genetic variants and human phenotypes, such as diseases or complex traits. By examining the entire genome, GWAS aim to detect common genetic variations that may contribute to an individual's risk of developing a particular condition. These studies have successfully mapped thousands of loci associated with complex traits, enriching our knowledge about the genetic basis of diseases and potentially leading to the identification of novel drug targets.

The largest gene knock- down experiments performed to date have used multiple short interfering/short hairpin (si/sh)RNAs per gene. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been gaining popularity as the gene Knock-down tool of choice by many researchers because of the clean nature of their workingsAs well as the technical simplicity and cost efficiency in their applications. | Gene knock-down is a molecular biology technique used to reduce or inhibit the expression of a specific gene, allowing researchers to study its function and role in various biological processes. This is achieved by introducing small molecules, such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA), which bind to the target messenger RNA (mRNA) and prevent its translation into protein. The process of gene knock-down can be transient or stable, depending on the method used. Transient knock-down typically involves siRNA, which provides temporary inhibition of gene expression, while stable knock-down employs shRNA integrated into the genome for long-term suppression.

644ea41957b1c7a31500007b,bioasq,"What are the necessary steps for the transition from a precursor mRNA to a mature
mRNA?","Transport of messenger RNA (mRNA) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is an essential step of eukaryotic gene expression. Messenger RNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) are produced as the nascent transcripts of RNA polymerase II in the cell nucleus and must undergo extensive maturational processing, including 5'-end capping, splicing, and 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation. | The process of converting precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) to mature mRNA involves several key steps that occur within the cell nucleus of eukaryotic cells. These include pre-mRNA transcription, capping, splicing, polyadenylation, and transport to the cytoplasm for translation. | The necessary steps for the transition from a precursor mRNA to a mature mRNA include capping, splicing, cleavage, and polyadenylation. Capping refers to the addition of a modified guanine nucleotide to the 5' end of the pre-mRNA, while splicing removes the non-coding introns and joins the coding exons. Cleavage involves the cutting of the pre-mRNA at a specific site downstream of the coding sequence, and polyadenylation adds a string of adenosine nucleotides to the 3' end of the mRNA. | The necessary steps for the transition from a precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) to a mature mRNA include 5'-end capping, splicing, and 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation. These processes remove introns, join exons, and add necessary structures to the mRNA molecule, preparing it for transportation out of the nucleus and subsequent protein synthesis. | The process of mRNA maturation involves several steps that are essential for the production of a functional mRNA molecule. The first step is pre-mRNA processing, which includes capping, splicing, and polyadenylation. Capping involves the addition of a 7-methylguanosine cap to the 5' end of the pre-mRNA molecule, which protects it from degradation and facilitates its translation. Splicing removes introns from the pre-mRNA molecule and joins together exons to form a continuous coding sequence. This process is mediated by small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and other splicing factors. Finally, polyadenylation adds a string of adenine nucleotides to the 3' end of the pre-mRNA molecule, which also helps protect it from degradation and plays a role in regulating its stability and translation efficiency. Once these steps are completed, the mature mRNA molecule can be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it can be translated into protein by ribosomes. | The transition from a precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) to a mature mRNA involves several essential steps that occur during the process of RNA maturation. First, capping occurs at the 5' end of the pre-mRNA, where a 7-methylguanosine cap is added to protect the transcript from degradation and facilitate translation initiation. Second, splicing takes place, which involves the removal of introns (non-coding sequences) and ligation of exons (coding sequences) by the spliceosome, a complex composed of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and other proteins. Splice sites are recognized by specific consensus sequences at exon-intron boundaries, ensuring accurate splicing. Alternative splicing can also occur, generating multiple mature mRNAs with different coding potentials from a single pre-mRNA molecule. Finally, polyadenylation occurs at the 3' end of the transcript, where a poly(A) tail consisting of approximately 200 adenine nucleotides is added by poly(A) polymerase. This tail enhances mRNA stability and promotes nuclear export as well as translation efficiency. Once these modifications are complete, the mature mRNA is transported out of the nucleus through nuclear pores into the cytoplasm for translation into protein by ribosomes. | The transition from precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) to mature mRNA involves several critical processing steps. Firstly, the 5'-end of the pre-mRNA undergoes capping, which helps protect the transcript from degradation and facilitates translation initiation. Next, RNA splicing occurs, where introns are removed and exons are joined together to generate a continuous coding sequence. This process can create diverse mature mRNA molecules from a limited number of genes through alternative splicing events that include or exclude specific introns and exons. Finally, the 3'-end of the pre-mRNA undergoes cleavage and polyadenylation, adding a poly(A) tail that enhances stability and promotes nuclear export. Once these processing steps are complete, the mature mRNA is transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation into proteins by ribosomes.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33923658 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25836925 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24617759 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35930970 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25487206 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19429779 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132066 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21823231 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25761502 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27350684 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12091875 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6744418 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14576302 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016162 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25081038 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17210931 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25110027 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27198613 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18630752 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31794245 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20044349 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28888105 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25929182 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18304944,24,20,"RNA splicing is a critical step in the maturation of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) by removing introns and exons.

It is caused by mutations in the PABPN1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1. This protein plays an important role in processing messenger RNA molecules, which are essential for producing proteins. The mutated PABPN1 gene leads to the production of an abnormal form of the poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 protein that accumulates in muscle cells and causes damage over time. The exact mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve disruptions in normal cellular processes such as protein folding and degradation. OPMD typically develops in adulthood and can lead to progressive weakness and wasting of the affected muscles, including those involved in swallowing and speaking. There is currently no cure for OPMD, but treatments are available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. | Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects muscle function, causing slowly progressive ptosis, dysphagia, and proximal limb weakness. The disease is caused by the abnormal expansion of the alanine-encoding (GCN)n trinucleotide repeat in the exon 1 of the polyadenosine (poly[A]) binding protein nuclear 1 gene. This leads to an accumulation of toxic intranuclear aggregates in affected cells, which ultimately results in muscle degeneration and weakness. A common cause of OPMD is the short expansion of a GCG or GCA trinucleotide repeat in PABPN1 gene. While there is currently no cure for OPMD, several treatments are available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life for affected individuals. These include physical therapy, speech therapy, and surgical interventions such as eyelid surgery or feeding tube placement. | Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness, particularly affecting the muscles of the eyelids and throat. The primary cause of OPMD is a mutation in the PABPN1 gene, which encodes for polyadenylate-binding protein nuclear 1. This protein plays a crucial role in mRNA processing and stability. The mutation involves an abnormal expansion of a trinucleotide repeat sequence (GCN) within the PABPN1 gene, leading to an elongated polyalanine tract in the protein. This expanded polyalanine tract causes misfolding and aggregation of PABPN1, resulting in intranuclear inclusion bodies that impair normal cellular function and ultimately lead to muscle cell degeneration. OPMD follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene from either parent is sufficient to cause the disease. However, symptoms typically manifest later in life, with onset usually occurring between 40-60 years of age. | Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset intractable myopathy characterized by slowly progressive ptosis, dysphagia, and proximal limb weakness. The primary cause of OPMD is the abnormal expansion of the alanine-encoding (GCN)n trinucleotide repeat in exon 1 of the polyadenosine (poly[A]) binding protein nuclear 1 gene (PABPN1). In individuals with OPMD, this trinucleotide repeat expands to 11-18 repeats instead of the normal 10 repeats. This expansion commonly occurs through short expansions of GCG or GCA trinucleotide repeats within the PABPN1 gene.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33805441 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34225694,2,2,"Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset intractable myopathy, characterized by slowly progressive ptosis, dysphagia, and proximal limb weakness.

Cell division requires cell cycle checkpoints that are used by the cell to both monitor and regulate the progress of the cell cycle. Deregulation of the cell cycle underlies the aberrant cell proliferation that characterizes cancer and loss of cell cycle checkpoint control promotes genetic instability.  Tumor suppressor genes are genes that protect the cell from a single event or multiple events leading to cancer. When these genes mutate, the cell can progress to a cancerous state. We now recognize that tumor suppressor genes regulate diverse cellular activities, including cell cycle checkpoint responses, detection and repair of DNA damage, protein ubiquitination and degradation, mitogenic signaling, cell specification, differentiation and migration, and tumor angiogenesis. | Negative cell-cycle regulators that can cause cancer when mutated are commonly referred to as tumor suppressor genes. These genes play a crucial role in controlling cell division and preventing uncontrolled proliferation, which could lead to the formation of tumors. Tumor suppressor genes function by inhibiting cell cycle progression, promoting DNA repair, and inducing apoptosis in response to cellular stress or damage. Some well-known examples of tumor suppressor genes include TP53 (p53), RB1 (retinoblastoma protein), and CDKN2A (p16INK4a). Mutations or loss of function in these genes can disrupt their ability to regulate the cell cycle, thereby contributing to the development of cancer. In many cases, both copies of a tumor suppressor gene must be inactivated for a complete loss of function, following Knudson's two-hit hypothesis.

It is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA, which affect the function of mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles within cells. Leigh syndrome can be inherited in different ways depending on the underlying genetic cause. In cases where it is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA, it is usually inherited maternally, meaning that affected mothers pass the condition to all of their children. In contrast, when Leigh syndrome is caused by mutations in nuclear DNA, it follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, meaning that affected individuals inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent). Genetic testing can help identify the specific genetic cause of Leigh syndrome in affected individuals and their family members, which can inform reproductive decisions and potential treatment options. | Leigh syndrome (LS) is a rare and fatal disorder caused by a deficit of various respiratory chain and Krebs cycle enzymes, leading to insufficient production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The disease can be inherited through autosomal recessive, X-linked, or maternal transmission. Cases with maternal inheritance are due to a mitochondrial DNA point mutation. LS is characterized by progressive multisystem involvement, including the central nervous system, cardiac and respiratory systems. The most commonly affected tissues are those with high energy demands such as the brainstem, basal ganglia, and optic nerves. Symptoms usually appear in infancy or early childhood and include developmental delay, weakness, hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, and respiratory failure. Genetic testing is necessary for diagnosis confirmation. Unfortunately, there is no cure for LS yet; treatment mainly focuses on supportive care to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. | Leigh syndrome, also known as subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy, is a rare inherited neurometabolic disorder. It is primarily inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that both copies of the gene in each cell must have mutations for an individual to be affected. In most cases, the parents of a child with Leigh syndrome are carriers of one copy of the mutated gene but do not show symptoms themselves. However, some forms of Leigh syndrome can be inherited through mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), following a maternal inheritance pattern. In this case, only the mother's mtDNA is passed on to her children, and all offspring will inherit the mutation if the mother carries it. Additionally, there are rare instances where Leigh syndrome follows an X-linked inheritance pattern involving mutations in specific genes located on the X chromosome. Overall, Leigh syndrome's inheritance patterns can vary depending on the specific genetic mutations involved, with autosomal recessive being the most common mode of inheritance. | Leigh syndrome (LS) is a rare progressive multisystem fatal disorder that can be inherited through various modes of transmission, including autosomal recessive, X-linked, and maternal inheritance.

The AR gene is located on the X chromosome and encodes for the androgen receptor protein, which plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of male sex hormones called androgens. The mutation involves an abnormal expansion of a trinucleotide repeat sequence (CAG) within the AR gene, leading to an elongated polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor protein. This expanded polyglutamine tract causes misfolding of the protein, resulting in aggregation and accumulation within motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. The toxic gain-of-function mechanism associated with these aggregates leads to selective degeneration of motor neurons, causing progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, and other symptoms characteristic of SBMA. As SBMA is an X-linked recessive disorder, it predominantly affects males; females can be carriers but usually do not exhibit symptoms or have milder manifestations due to random X-inactivation. | Spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy's disease, is a neuromuscular disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. This inherited condition affects motoneurons and leads to muscle weakness and atrophy. The mutant AR protein is presumed to act within motoneurons, contributing to the development of SBMA symptoms. Nearly all cases of Kennedy's disease can be attributed to mutations in the AR gene, making it the primary cause of this disorder (PubMed: 35996994, 20689246, 32773451).",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35996994 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20689246 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32773451,3,3,"Kennedy's disease is nearly exclusively caused by mutations in the androgen receptor encoding gene (AR). | Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, and mutant AR is presumed to act in motoneurons to cause SBMA."

The discovery of the broad conservation of embryonic regulatory genes across animal phyla, launched by the cloning of homeotic genes in the 1980s, was a founding event in the field of evolutionary developmental biology. While it had long been known that fundamental cellular processes, commonly referred to as housekeeping functions, are shared by animals and plants, Hox genes were different: mutations in these genes caused ""bizarre"" homeotic transformations of insect body parts that were certainly interesting but were expected to be idiosyncratic. The isolation of the genes responsible for these bizarre phenotypes turned out to be highly conserved Hox genes that play roles in embryonic patterning throughout Metazoa. | Homeotic transformation refers to the process of transforming one body part into the likeness of another body part.

The relevance of these findings to human developmental defects is still being researched | Homeotic transformation refers to a genetic phenomenon where one body part is replaced by another during development. This process is controlled by homeobox genes, which are responsible for the formation of body segments and the differentiation of tissues. Homeotic transformations can result in abnormal morphological structures and developmental defects, such as the replacement of antennae with legs in fruit flies or the transformation of petals into sepals in plants. These transformations can occur spontaneously due to mutations or environmental factors, but they can also be induced experimentally through gene manipulation techniques. The study of homeotic transformations has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying embryonic development and pattern formation, as well as their evolutionary conservation across different species. Understanding these processes may have important implications for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering applications. | Homeotic transformation refers to a developmental anomaly in which one body part or structure is replaced by another that is morphologically and functionally distinct, typically due to alterations in the expression of homeotic genes. These genes, also known as Hox genes, play a crucial role in determining the identity and positioning of body segments during embryonic development. Homeotic transformations can result from mutations or misregulation of Hox genes, leading to changes in their spatial or temporal expression patterns. For example, a classic example of homeotic transformation is the Antennapedia mutation in Drosophila melanogaster, where legs develop in place of antennae on the head.

644e7e5257b1c7a315000078,bioasq,What is the role of enhancers in cancer?,"Recent studies have revealed that the deregulation of distal gene regulatory elements, such as enhancers, appears in several pathophysiological conditions, including cancer. In cancer, mutations often misregulate enhancers that normally control the signal-dependent expression of growth-related genes. This misregulation can result from trans-acting mechanisms, such as activation of the transcription factors or epigenetic regulators that control enhancer activity or can be caused in cis by direct mutations that alter the activity of the enhancer or its target gene specificity. These processes can generate tumor-type-specific super-enhancers and establish a 'locked' gene regulatory state that drives the uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells. | Enhancers are regulatory elements that control gene expression by binding to transcription factors and promoting the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoter region. In cancer, enhancers can play a critical role in driving oncogenic transcriptional programs by activating genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. Enhancer activation can occur through various mechanisms, including genetic alterations such as amplifications or translocations, epigenetic modifications such as histone acetylation or DNA methylation, and aberrant signaling pathways. Recent studies have shown that enhancer hijacking is a common mechanism of oncogene activation in cancer, where non-coding mutations can create de novo enhancers or redirect existing ones to drive oncogenic gene expression. Targeting enhancer-driven transcriptional programs has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment, with several ongoing clinical trials testing small molecule inhibitors of key transcriptional regulators or chromatin modifiers involved in enhancer regulation. | Enhancers are regulatory DNA sequences that play a crucial role in the spatial and temporal control of gene expression. In cancer, enhancers can contribute to tumorigenesis through various mechanisms. First, they may undergo genetic alterations such as mutations, amplifications, or deletions, leading to aberrant activation or repression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Second, epigenetic modifications at enhancer regions, including changes in histone marks and DNA methylation patterns, can result in dysregulated gene expression contributing to cancer development and progression. Third, the three-dimensional organization of chromatin can bring enhancers into close proximity with target genes via chromosomal looping; alterations in this architecture may lead to misregulation of gene expression in cancer cells. Finally, enhancer hijacking events can occur when structural variations cause an active enhancer to be relocated near a normally silent oncogene, driving its overexpression.

Beyond the conventional function of enhancers in recruiting transcription factors to gene promoters, enhancer elements are also transcribed into noncoding RNAs known as enhancer RNAs (eRNA). Accumulating evidence suggests that uncontrolled enhancer activity with aberrant eRNA expression promotes oncogenesis. Interestingly, tissue-specific, transcribed eRNAs from active enhancers can serve as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers in several cancer types. | Enhancers are cis-regulatory sequences that fine-tune expression of their target genes in a spatiotemporal manner. They are recognized by sequence-specific transcription factors, which in turn recruit transcriptional coactivators that facilitate transcription by promoting assembly and activation of the basal transcriptional machinery. Their functional importance is underscored by the fact that they are often the target of genetic and nongenetic events in human disease that disrupt their sequence, interactome, activation potential, and/or chromatin environment. Dysregulation of transcription and addiction to transcriptional effectors that interact with and modulate enhancer activity are common features of cancer cells and are amenable to therapeutic intervention."

644e642a57b1c7a315000075,bioasq,Do all proteins start with methionine?,"In eukaryotes, it is generally assumed that translation initiation occurs at the AUG codon closest to the messenger RNA 5' cap, which codes for methionine; hence, an initial assumption would be that all proteins should contain a methionine at their N-terminus (i.e., start site). However, this is not the case mostly for two reasons. First, in certain cases, initiation can occur at codons differing from AUG, which may still code for methionine (e.g., AGG) or less commonly another amino acid (e.g., GUC coding for valine). Moreover, N-terminal methionine can be cleaved after translation by the enzyme methionine aminopeptidase and this removal can be crucial for the function and stability of the final protein. For these reasons, not all proteins start with methionine at their N-terminus. | Methionine is commonly considered as the first amino acid in most proteins. However, not all proteins start with methionine. In some cases, the initial methionine residue is removed post-translationally by specific enzymes called aminopeptidases. Additionally, alternative translation initiation sites can also lead to the production of protein isoforms that lack the N-terminal methionine residue. Moreover, some proteins have an initiator tRNA that carries a formylated methionine instead of a regular methionine at their N-terminus. This formyl group is usually removed later by deformylases. Therefore, while methionine is often present at the beginning of many proteins, it is not always required for proper protein function or stability. | All proteins do not necessarily start with methionine, but it is common for eukaryotic and archaeal proteins to begin with this amino acid. During the initiation of translation, the first codon in the mRNA sequence is typically an AUG codon, which codes for methionine. This process is facilitated by the initiator tRNA (tRNAi^Met) that carries methionine and recognizes the start codon. However, there are exceptions to this rule. In some cases, alternative start codons such as CUG, GUG, or UUG can be used to initiate translation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These alternative start codons usually code for amino acids like leucine or valine instead of methionine. Additionally, post-translational modifications can occur after protein synthesis, leading to the removal of the initial methionine or its modification into another amino acid like acetylated methionine or formylmethionine (fMet), which is commonly found in bacterial proteins. Therefore, while many proteins do initially start with methionine due to the canonical AUG start codon, there are exceptions where alternative initiation events or post-translational modifications result in proteins that do not begin with this amino acid.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12867081 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21266472 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15215523 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28369664 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28334756 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9710598 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8199241 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36173861 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11738381,9,11,"The use of several translation initiation codons in a single mRNA, by expressing several proteins from a single gene, contributes to the generation of protein diversity.

CMT is classified into several types based on the affected genes, mode of inheritance, and clinical features. The main types are CMT1, CMT2, CMT3, CMT4, and CMTX. CMT1 is further divided into subtypes (CMT1A, CMT1B, etc.) and primarily affects the myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers. It is caused by mutations in genes such as PMP22, MPZ, and EGR2. CMT2 affects the axons within nerves and results from mutations in genes like MFN2, GARS, NEFL among others. Both CMT1 and 2 have autosomal dominant inheritance patterns. In contrast, CMT3 or Dejerine-Sottas disease presents early in life with severe demyelination due to mutations in PMP22 or MPZ genes. CMT4 comprises various autosomal recessive subtypes (CMT4A-J) affecting both myelin sheath and axons with mutations in different genes like GDAP1 or SH3TC2.

The contribution of regulatory variation in non-coding regions to rare disease, including DD, remains very poorly understood. We screened 9,858 probands from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study for de novo mutations in the 5' untranslated regions (5' UTRs) of genes within which variants have previously been shown to cause DD through a dominant haploinsufficient mechanism. We identified four single-nucleotide variants and two copy-number variants upstream of MEF2C in a total of ten individual probands. We developed multiple bespoke and orthogonal experimental approaches to demonstrate that these variants cause DD through three distinct loss-of-function mechanisms, disrupting transcription, translation, and/or protein function. These non-coding region variants represent 23% of likely diagnoses identified in MEF2C in the DDD cohort, but these would all be missed in standard clinical genetics approaches. Nonetheless, these variants are readily detectable in exome sequence data, with 30.7% of 5' UTR bases across all genes well covered in the DDD dataset. Our analyses show that non-coding variants upstream of genes within which coding variants are known to cause DD are an important cause of severe disease and demonstrate that analyzing 5' UTRs can increase diagnostic yield. We also show how non-coding variants can help inform both the disease-causing mechanism underlying protein-coding variants and dosage tolerance of the gene."

YY1 is a transcription factor that can activate or repress transcription of a variety of genes and is involved in several developmental processes. YY1 overexpression and/or activation is associated with unchecked cellular proliferation, resistance to apoptotic stimuli, tumorigenesis and metastatic potential. YY1, in addition to its regulatory roles in normal biologic processes, may possess the potential to act as an initiator of tumorigenesis and may thus serve as both a diagnostic and prognostic tumor marker; furthermore, it may provide an effective target for antitumor chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. | YY1 is a transcription factor that can activate or repress transcription of a variety of genes and is involved in several developmental processes. Although YY1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor, YY1 interacts with M-MITF, the Waardenburg Syndrome IIA gene and a master transcriptional regulator of melanocytes.

By using oligonucleotide competition and a specific antibody we demonstrated that the transcription factor YY1 is responsible for the formation of complex BIII. Also in this case, the transient expression of the YY1 cDNA in CHO cells resulted in an increased transcription from the FE65 minimal promoter.

Joubert syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous neurological ciliopathy syndrome with molar tooth sign as the neuroimaging hallmark. We reviewed the clinical, radiological and genetic data for several families with a clinical diagnosis of Joubert syndrome but negative genetic analysis. We detected biallelic pathogenic variants in LAMA1, including novel alleles, in each of the four cases we report, thereby establishing a firm diagnosis of Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome. Analysis of brain MRI revealed cerebellar dysplasia and cerebellar cysts, associated with Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome and the absence of typical molar tooth signs. Using large UK patient cohorts, the relative prevalence of Joubert syndrome as a cause of intellectual disability was 0.2% and of Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome was 0.02%. We conclude that children with congenital brain disorders that mimic Joubert syndrome may have a delayed diagnosis due to poor recognition of key features on brain imaging and the lack of inclusion of LAMA1 on molecular genetic gene panels.

Given the increasing reports of abuse and evidence of potential harms associated with gabapentin use, it is important that clinicians consider alternative treatment options to off-label gabapentin for the management of chronic pelvic pain and no obvious pelvic pathology."

Analysis of this study cohort (n = 53) in tandem with published cases (n = 80) revealed that patients with chromosomal deletions and protein truncating variants had a significantly higher burden of systemic disease (with earlier onset of dystonia) than those with missense variants. Eighteen individuals had detailed longitudinal data available after insertion of deep brain stimulation for medically refractory dystonia. Median age at deep brain stimulation was 11.5 years (range: 4.5-37.0 years). Follow-up after deep brain stimulation ranged from 0.25 to 22 years.

However, the underlying mechanism is not clear. Here we generated an Adamts18-deficient mouse strain as an in vivo model to investigate the role of ADAMTS18 in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. In AOM/DSS-induced colitis-associated colorectal cancer, the deficiency of Adamts18 in mice resulted in enhanced tumorigenesis and colon inflammation that could be attributed in part to enhanced nuclear translocation of β-catenin and elevated expression of its downstream target genes, cyclin D1 and c-myc. Moreover, increased p38MAPK and ERK1/2 activities were detected in colon cancer cells from Adamts18-deficient mice. Further studies revealed that ADAMTS18 deficiency reduced intestinal E-cadherin levels in mice, which ultimately led to intestinal barrier dysfunction.

The X-linked FHF2 gene (also known as FGF13) has alternative first exons which produce multiple protein isoforms that differ in their N-terminal sequence. The variants were located at highly conserved residues in the FHF2A inactivation particle that competes with the intrinsic fast inactivation mechanism of Nav channels. Functional characterization of mutant FHF2A co-expressed with wild-type Nav1.6 (SCN8A) revealed that mutant FHF2A proteins lost the ability to induce rapid-onset, long-term blockade of the channel while retaining pro-excitatory properties. These gain-of-function effects are likely to increase neuronal excitability consistent with the epileptic potential of FHF2 variants.

Eighteen affected individuals from nine unrelated families showed a consistent phenotype characterized by reduced growth, skeletal features, distinctive craniofacial appearance, and dental anomalies. In vitro functional validation studies demonstrated a variable impact of disease-causing variants on transcript processing, protein secretion and function, and their dysregulating effect on bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. We show that SCUBE3 acts as a BMP2/BMP4 co-receptor, recruits the BMP receptor complexes into raft microdomains, and positively modulates signaling possibly by augmenting the specific interactions between BMPs and BMP type I receptors. Scube3-/- mice showed craniofacial and dental defects, reduced body size, and defective endochondral bone growth due to impaired BMP-mediated chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, recapitulating the human disorder. Our findings identify a human disease caused by defective function of a member of the SCUBE family, and link SCUBE3 to processes controlling growth, morphogenesis, and bone and teeth development through modulation of BMP signaling."

Strikingly, ~72% of them could not be assigned to a specific gene and initiate at unconventional regions, outside promoters or enhancers. Here, we probe these unassigned TSSs and show that, in all species studied, a significant fraction of CAGE peaks initiate at microsatellites, also called short tandem repeats (STRs). To confirm this transcription, we develop Cap Trap RNA-seq, a technology which combines cap trapping and long read MinION sequencing. We train sequence-based deep learning models able to predict CAGE signal at STRs with high accuracy. These models unveil the importance of STR surrounding sequences not only to distinguish STR classes, but also to predict the level of transcription initiation.

Here we describe six unrelated individuals with de novo missense variants affecting the ATPase domain of VPS4A, a critical enzyme regulating ESCRT function. Probands had structural brain abnormalities, severe neurodevelopmental delay, cataracts, growth impairment, and anemia. In cultured cells, overexpression of VPS4A mutants caused enlarged endosomal vacuoles resembling those induced by expression of known dominant-negative ATPase-defective forms of VPS4A. Proband-derived fibroblasts had enlarged endosomal structures with abnormal accumulation of the ESCRT protein IST1 on the limiting membrane. VPS4A function was also required for normal endosomal morphology and IST1 localization in iPSC-derived human neurons. Mutations affected other ESCRT-dependent cellular processes, including regulation of centrosome number, primary cilium morphology, nuclear membrane morphology, chromosome segregation, mitotic spindle formation, and cell cycle progression.

Using clinical and genetic data, we identify 19 individuals harboring various types of SOX6 alterations and exhibiting developmental delay and/or intellectual disability; the individuals are from 17 unrelated families. Additional, inconstant features include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, mild facial dysmorphism, craniosynostosis, and multiple osteochondromas. All variants are heterozygous. Fourteen are de novo, one is inherited from a mosaic father, and four offspring from two families have a paternally inherited variant. Intragenic microdeletions, balanced structural rearrangements, frameshifts, and nonsense variants are predicted to inactivate the SOX6 variant allele. Four missense variants occur in residues and protein regions highly conserved evolutionarily. These variants are not detected in the gnomAD control cohort, and the amino acid substitutions are predicted to be damaging. Two of these variants are located in the HMG domain and abolish SOX6 transcriptional activity in vitro. No clear genotype-phenotype correlations are found.

Novel rare variants in the gene identified were independently identified in a cohort of 680 adult-onset patients. Variants were expressed in COS cells and function assessed by patch-clamp and rubidium flux analysis.RESULTS: We identified a de novo novel heterozygous predicted deleterious missense variant c.G2873A (p.R958H) in ABCC8 in a child with idiopathic PAH. We then evaluated all individuals in the original and a second cohort for rare or novel variants in ABCC8 and identified 11 additional heterozygous predicted damaging ABCC8 variants. ABCC8 encodes SUR1 (sulfonylurea receptor 1)-a regulatory subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel. We observed loss of ATP-sensitive potassium channel function for all ABCC8 variants evaluated and pharmacological rescue of all channel currents in vitro by the SUR1 activator, diazoxide.CONCLUSIONS: Novel and rare missense variants in ABCC8 are associated with PAH. Identified ABCC8 mutations decreased ATP-sensitive potassium channel function, which was pharmacologically recovered."

Functional tests were performed to study their pathogenicity and understand the disease mechanism.RESULTS: The consistent clinical features of the affected individuals, from seven unrelated families, included choanal atresia, athelia or hypoplastic nipples, branchial sinus abnormalities, neck pits, lacrimal duct anomalies, hearing loss, external ear malformations, and thyroid abnormalities. None of the individuals had intellectual disability.

We used circular dichroism to show secondary structure changes and isothermal titration calorimetry to investigate the impact of variants on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding. Pathogenicity was further supported by enzymatic assays and mass spectroscopy on recombinant protein, patient-derived fibroblasts, plasma, and erythrocytes. Response to supplementation was measured with clinical validated rating scales, electrophysiology, and biochemical quantification.RESULTS: We identified biallelic mutations in PDXK in 5 individuals from 2 unrelated families with primary axonal polyneuropathy and optic atrophy. The natural history of this disorder suggests that untreated, affected individuals become wheelchair-bound and blind. We identified conformational rearrangement in the mutant enzyme around the ATP-binding pocket. Low PDXK ATP binding resulted in decreased erythrocyte PDXK activity and low pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) concentrations. We rescued the clinical and biochemical profile with PLP supplementation in 1 family, improvement in power, pain, and fatigue contributing to patients regaining their ability to walk independently during the first year of PLP normalization.INTERPRETATION: We show that mutations in PDXK cause autosomal recessive axonal peripheral polyneuropathy leading to disease via reduced PDXK enzymatic activity and low PLP. We show that the biochemical profile can be rescued with PLP supplementation associated with clinical improvement. As B6 is a cofactor in diverse essential biological pathways, our findings may have direct implications for neuropathies of unknown etiology characterized by reduced PLP levels.

Despite strong evidence for heritability, genome-wide association studies have had little success in identification of risk loci associated with epilepsy, probably because of relatively small sample sizes and insufficient power. We aimed to identify risk loci through meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies for all epilepsy and the two largest clinical subtypes (genetic generalised epilepsy and focal epilepsy).METHODS: We combined genome-wide association data from 12 cohorts of individuals with epilepsy and controls from population-based datasets. Controls were ethnically matched with cases. We phenotyped individuals with epilepsy into categories of genetic generalised epilepsy, focal epilepsy, or unclassified epilepsy. After standardised filtering for quality control and imputation to account for different genotyping platforms across sites, investigators at each site conducted a linear mixed-model association analysis for each dataset. Combining summary statistics, we conducted fixed-effects meta-analyses of all epilepsy, focal epilepsy, and genetic generalised epilepsy. We set the genome-wide significance threshold at p<1·66 × 10(-8).FINDINGS: We included 8696 cases and 26 157 controls in our analysis. Meta-analysis of the all-epilepsy cohort identified loci at 2q24.3 (p=8·71 × 10(-10)), implicating SCN1A, and at 4p15.1 (p=5·44 × 10(-9)), harbouring PCDH7, which encodes a protocadherin molecule not previously implicated in epilepsy. For the cohort of genetic generalised epilepsy, we noted a single signal at 2p16.1 (p=9·99 × 10(-9)), implicating VRK2 or FANCL. No single nucleotide polymorphism achieved genome-wide significance for focal epilepsy.INTERPRETATION: This meta-analysis describes a new locus not previously implicated in epilepsy and provides further evidence about the genetic architecture of these disorders, with the ultimate aim of assisting in disease classification and prognosis. The data suggest that specific loci can act pleiotropically raising risk for epilepsy broadly, or can have effects limited to a specific epilepsy subtype. Future genetic analyses might benefit from both lumping (ie, grouping of epilepsy types together) or splitting (ie, analysis of specific clinical subtypes).FUNDING: International League Against Epilepsy and multiple governmental and philanthropic agencies."

However, the expression and biological role of miR-301b in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unclear. Here we aimed to evaluate the roles and mechanisms of miR-301b in TNBC cells. miR-301b expression was assessed in TNBC specimens and cell lines by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). TNBC cells were transfected with miR-301b mimics, inhibitors or Cylindromatosis (CYLD) small interfering RNA (siRNA) using Lipofectamine 2000. The functional roles of miR-301b were determined by cell proliferation, colony formation, and apoptosis assays. Western blots and qRT-PCR were used to measure the expression of mRNAs and proteins in the cells. We found that miR-301b was upregulated in TNBC specimens and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-301b promoted cell proliferation in TNBC cells, while inhibited the apoptosis induced by 5-FU. CYLD was downregulated by miR-301b at both mRNA and protein levels in TNBC cells. Dual-luciferase report assay confirmed that miR-301b downregulated CYLD by direct interaction with the 3'-untranslated region(3'-UTR) of CYLD mRNA. NF-κB activation was mechanistically associated with miR-301b-mediated downregulation of CYLD. However, inhibition of miR-301b reversed all the effects of miR-301b.

The tumor-suppressing function of CYLD is associated with its deubiquitinating activity, which maps to the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein. In the present study we evaluated the role of intestinal epithelial CYLD in colitis-associated cancer using a conditional mouse CYLD inactivation model.METHODS: In order to evaluate the role of CYLD in intestinal epithelial carcinogenesis, mice (IEC-Cyld (Δ9) mice) that carry a mutation that eliminates the deubiquitinating domain of CYLD in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) were generated by crossing Villin-Cre transgenic mice to previously generated mice carrying a loxP-flanked Cyld exon 9 (Cyld (flx9) mice).RESULTS: We found that IEC-Cyld (Δ9) mice did not present spontaneous intestinal abnormalities up to one year of age. However, upon challenge with a combination of genotoxic (AOM) and pro-inflammatory (DSS) agents we found that the number of adenomas in the IEC-Cyld (Δ9) mice was dramatically increased compared to the control mice. Inactivation of CYLD in intestinal epithelial cells did not affect the classical nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and c-Jun kinase (JNK) activation pathways under physiological conditions, suggesting that these pathways do not predispose CYLD-deficient intestinal epithelia to colorectal cancer development before the onset of genotoxic and/or pro-inflammatory stress.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore a critical tumor-suppressing role for functional intestinal epithelial CYLD in colitis-associated carcinogenesis. CYLD expression and its associated pathways in intestinal tumors may be exploited for future prognostic and therapeutic purposes."

Here, we present a network-based approach, metPropagate, that uses untargeted metabolomics (UM) data from a single patient and a group of controls to prioritize candidate genes in patients with suspected IEMs. We validate metPropagate on 107 patients with IEMs diagnosed in Miller et al.

These findings reveal a previously unrecognized feature of SE architecture in Mendelian diseases of immunity: heterozygous mutations in SE-regulated genes identified by whole-exome/genome sequencing may have greater significance than previously recognized."

The identification of cancers with a significant adenosine drive is critical to understand the potential for these molecules. However, it is challenging to measure tumor adenosine levels at scale, thus novel, clinically tractable biomarkers are needed.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We generated a gene expression signature for the adenosine signaling using regulatory networks derived from the literature and validated this in patients. We applied the signature to large cohorts of disease from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and cohorts of immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated patients.RESULTS: The signature captures baseline adenosine levels in vivo (r 2 = 0.92, P = 0.018), is reduced after small-molecule inhibition of A2AR in mice (r 2 = -0.62, P = 0.001) and humans (reduction in 5 of 7 patients, 70%), and is abrogated after A2AR knockout. Analysis of TCGA confirms a negative association between adenosine and overall survival (OS, HR = 0.6, P < 2.2e-16) as well as progression-free survival (PFS, HR = 0.77, P = 0.0000006). Further, adenosine signaling is associated with reduced OS (HR = 0.47, P < 2.2e-16) and PFS (HR = 0.65, P = 0.0000002) in CD8+ T-cell-infiltrated tumors. Mutation of TGFβ superfamily members is associated with enhanced adenosine signaling and worse OS (HR = 0.43, P < 2.2e-16). Finally, adenosine signaling is associated with reduced efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in published cohorts (HR = 0.29, P = 0.00012).CONCLUSIONS: These data support the adenosine pathway as a mediator of a successful antitumor immune response, demonstrate the prognostic potential of the signature for immunotherapy, and inform patient selection strategies for adenosine pathway modulators currently in development."

CyldEΔ9/Δ9 mice were born alive but developed hair and sebaceous gland abnormalities and dental defects at 100% and 60% penetrance, respectively. Upon topical challenge with DMBA/TPA, these animals primarily developed sebaceous and basaloid tumors resembling human CYLDm-syndrome as opposed to papilloma, which is most commonly induced in WT mice by this treatment. Molecular analysis revealed that TRAF6-K63-Ubiquitination (K63-Ub), c-Myc-K63-Ub, and phospho-c-Myc (S62) were markedly elevated in CyldEΔ9/Δ9 skin. Topical treatment with a pharmacological c-Myc inhibitor induced sebaceous and basal cell apoptosis in CyldEΔ9/Δ9 skin.

Laboratory studies were carried out in human mCRPC organoid cultures, prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines, and mouse xenograft models. Epigenetic studies were carried out in a rapid autopsy cohort.RESULTS: Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) expression is increased in DNPC relative to prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-expressing mCRPC in the Stand Up to Cancer/Prostate Cancer Foundation discovery cohort (11.2 v 0.28 reads per kilobase per million mapped reads; q < 0.05; n = 117) and in the University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center cohort (9.2 v 0.99 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads; P < .0001). DKK1 expression can be regulated by activated Wnt signaling in vitro and correlates with activating canonical Wnt signaling mutations and low PSA mRNA in mCRPC biopsies (P < .05). DKK1 hypomethylation was associated with increased DKK1 mRNA expression (Pearson r = -0.66; P < .0001) in a rapid autopsy cohort (n = 7). DKK1-high mCRPC biopsies are infiltrated with significantly higher numbers of quiescent natural killer (NK) cells (P < .005) and lower numbers of activated NK cells (P < .0005). Growth inhibition of the human PCa model PC3 by the anti-DKK1 monoclonal antibody DKN-01 depends on the presence of NK cells in a severe combined immunodeficient xenograft mouse model.CONCLUSION: These results support DKK1 as a contributor to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of DNPC.

Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) is caused by a large hemizygous deletion on chromosome 7q11.23 which encompasses 26-28 genes, including GTF2I, the human gene encoding TFII-I. A subset of WBS patients has recently been shown to present with macrocytosis, a mild anemia characterized by enlarged erythrocytes.

More than 90% of cases are sporadic and there is an increased paternal age at the time of conception of affected individuals, suggesting that de novo mutations are of paternal origin. Affected individuals are fertile and achondroplasia is transmitted as a fully penetrant autosomal dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms of the disease (10%). In contrast, homozygous achondroplasia is usually lethal in the neonatal period and affects 25% of the offspring of matings between heterozygous achondroplasia parents. The gene responsible for achondroplasia has been mapped to chromosome 4p16.3 (refs 7, 8); the genetic interval encompassing the disease gene contains a member of the fibroblast-growth-factor receptor (FGFR3) family which is expressed in articular chondrocytes. Here we report the finding of recurrent missense mutations in a CpG doublet of the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein (glycine substituted with arginine at residue 380, G380R) in 17 sporadic cases and 6 unrelated familial forms of achondroplasia.

However, the clinical significance of TBC1D16 in EOC remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the expression and prognostic significance of TBC1D16 in EOC and its relationship with the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The tissue specimens included 156 histologically confirmed EOC and 30 normal ovarian tissues. The expression of TBC1D16 and VEGF was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the immunoreactive score was calculated with signal intensity and percentage of positive cells. IHC results showed that TBC1D16 and VEGF were both mainly localized in cytoplasm of epithelial cells in normal ovarian tissues and were expressed in cancer cells. Based on the immunoreactive score, TBC1D16 expression in EOC was categorized as ""high expression,"" compared with normal ovarian tissues (P < 0.05). The Chi-square test showed that high TBC1D16 expression was related to advanced pT stages (P = 0.029), but not correlated with other clinical features. Moreover, the TBC1D16 expression was significantly higher in EOC specimens with low VEGF expression (P < 0.001). Importantly, in both univariate and multivariate survival analyses, high expression of TBC1D16 was significantly correlated with good overall survival (OS).

Missing X-ray residues from the PDB have been widely used as a proxy for ID when developing computational methods. This may lead to a systematic bias, where predictors deviate from biologically relevant ID. Large benchmarking sets on experimentally validated ID are scarce. Recently, the DisProt database has been renewed and expanded to include manually curated ID annotations for several hundred new proteins. This provides a large benchmark set which has not yet been used for training ID predictors.Results: Here, we describe the first systematic benchmarking of ID predictors on the new DisProt dataset. In contrast to previous assessments based on missing X-ray data, this dataset contains mostly long ID regions and a significant amount of fully ID proteins. The benchmarking shows that ID predictors work quite well on the new dataset, especially for long ID segments. However, a large fraction of ID still goes virtually undetected and the ranking of methods is different than for PDB data.

Moreover, daily oral dosing of ESN364 throughout the menstrual cycle in M fascicularis lowered plasma estradiol levels in a dose-dependent manner, although nadir levels of estradiol were maintained well above menopausal levels. Nevertheless, estradiol levels during the follicular phase were sufficiently inhibited at all doses to preclude the triggering of ovulation as evidenced by the absence of the LH surge and failure of a subsequent luteal phase rise in plasma progesterone concentrations, consistent with the absence of normal cycle changes in the uterus. Apart from the point at surge, FSH levels were not altered over the course of the menstrual cycle. These effects of ESN364 were reversible upon cessation of drug treatment.  ESN364 was well-tolerated and rapidly bioavailable with linear pharmacokinetics and no drug accumulation with repeated, daily oral administration. Drug treatment dose-dependently decreased basal LH, but not FSH, and consequently decreased estradiol and progesterone (in women) as well as testosterone (in men). The hormonal changes in women corresponded to delayed ovulation, decreased endometrial thickening, impeded follicular maturation, and prolongation of the menstrual cycle. Drug effects were rapidly reversible. Oral administration of the NK3R antagonist, ESN364, suppressed the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in healthy volunteers by selective modulation of gonadotropin secretion, leading to a restrained decrease in ovarian hormone levels in women. These results suggest that ESN364 may offer therapeutic benefit in the treatment of women's health disorders with a mitigated risk of menopausal-like adverse events.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26305889 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26653113,2,5,"The NK3 Receptor Antagonist ESN364 Interrupts Pulsatile LH Secretion and Moderates Levels of Ovarian Hormones Throughout the Menstrual Cycle. | In this report, we demonstrate that systemic administration of an NK3R antagonist (ESN364) prolongs the LH interpulse interval in ovarectomized ewes and significantly lowers plasma LH and FSH concentrations in castrated nonhuman primates (Macaca fascicularis).

Our analysis of 4,227 such genes uncovers surprisingly high genetic variation across human populations. This increased diversity is unlikely to reflect relaxed purifying selection. Remarkably, MAE genes exhibit an elevated recombination rate and an increased density of hypermutable sequence contexts. However, these factors do not fully account for the increased diversity. We find that the elevated nucleotide diversity of MAE genes is also associated with greater allelic age: variants in these genes tend to be older and are enriched in polymorphisms shared by Neanderthals and chimpanzees. Both synonymous and nonsynonymous alleles of MAE genes have elevated average population frequencies. We also observed strong enrichment of the MAE signature among genes reported to evolve under balancing selection. We propose that an important biological function of widespread MAE might be the generation of cell-to-cell heterogeneity; the increased genetic variation contributes to this heterogeneity."

Thus, identification of novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers is urgently needed. We have used 42 paraffin-embedded HGSOCs, to evaluate the utility of DNA copy number alterations, as potential predictors of clinical outcome. Copy number-based unsupervised clustering stratified HGSOCs into two clusters of different immunohistopathological features and survival outcome (HR = 0.15, 95%CI = 0.03-0.81; Padj = 0.03). We found that loss at 6q24.2-26 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.01-0.43, Padj = 0.005). The prognostic value of this deletion was validated in two independent series, one consisting of 36 HGSOCs analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (P = 0.04) and another comprised of 411 HGSOCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA) (HR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.48-0.93, Padj = 0.019). In addition, we confirmed the association of low expression of the genes from the region with longer survival in 799 HGSOCs (HR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.61-0.90, log-rank P = 0.002) and 675 high-FIGO stage HGSOCs (HR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.61-0.96, log-rank P = 0.02) available from the online tool KM-plotter. Finally, by integrating copy number, RNAseq and survival data of 296 HGSOCs from TCGA we propose a few candidate genes that can potentially explain the association. Altogether our findings indicate that the 6q24.2-26 deletion is an independent marker of favorable outcome in HGSOCs with potential clinical value as it can be analyzed by FISH on tumor sections and guide the selection of patients towards more conservative therapeutic strategies in order to reduce side-effects and improve quality of life."

Here we show that a melanocyte umbrella above the kidney marrow protects HSPCs against ultraviolet light in zebrafish. Because mutants that lack melanocytes have normal steady-state haematopoiesis under standard laboratory conditions, we hypothesized that melanocytes above the stem cell niche protect HSPCs against ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage. Indeed, after ultraviolet-light irradiation, unpigmented larvae show higher levels of DNA damage in HSPCs, as indicated by staining of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and have reduced numbers of HSPCs, as shown by cmyb (also known as myb) expression.

To understand the genetic basis of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) susceptibility, a complex and highly prevalent congenital malformation, we searched for genetic variants with a regulatory role in a disease-related tissue, the lip muscle (orbicularis oris muscle [OOM]), of affected individuals. From 46 OOM samples, which are frequently discarded during routine corrective surgeries on patients with orofacial clefts, we derived mesenchymal stem cells and correlated the individual genetic variants with gene expression from these cultured cells. Through this strategy, we detected significant cis-eQTLs (i.e., DNA variants affecting gene expression) and selected a few candidates to conduct an association study in a large Brazilian cohort (624 patients and 668 controls). This resulted in the discovery of a novel susceptibility locus for NSCL/P, rs1063588, the best eQTL for the MRPL53 gene, where evidence for association was mostly driven by the Native American ancestry component of our Brazilian sample.

In this study, we investigated the transcriptional levels of 26 representative T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differentially expressed in PC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of T-UCR Uc.63+ was increased in PC tissues. MTT assay and wound healing assay revealed that Uc.63+ was involved in cell growth and cell migration. miR-130b was predicted to have binding sites within the Uc.63+ sequence. The expression of miR-130b was significantly disturbed by the overexpression or knockdown of Uc.63+. We also showed that Uc.63+ regulated the expression of MMP2 via miR-130b regulation. Furthermore, overexpression of Uc.63+ increased the expression of AR and its downstream molecule PSA and promoted resistance to docetaxel through AR regulation. In patients treated with docetaxel, the expression of serum Uc.63+ in the docetaxel-resistant patients was higher than that in the docetaxel-sensitive patients (P = 0.011). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high expression of serum Uc.63+ correlated with a worse prognosis (P = 0.020).

Our approach can also be combined with existing lossy compression schemes to further reduce entropy and allows the user to specify a reference panel of expected sequence variations to improve the model accuracy. In addition to extensive empirical evaluation, we also derive novel theoretical insights that explain the empirical performance and pitfalls of corpus-based quality score compression schemes in general.

Although highly conserved, the functional properties of promoters with different shapes and the genetic basis of their evolution remain unclear. Here we used natural genetic variation across a panel of 81 Drosophila lines to measure changes in transcriptional start site (TSS) usage, identifying thousands of genetic variants affecting transcript levels (strength) or the distribution of TSSs within a promoter (shape). Our results identify promoter shape as a molecular trait that can evolve independently of promoter strength. Broad promoters typically harbor shape-associated variants, with signatures of adaptive selection. Single-cell measurements demonstrate that variants modulating promoter shape often increase expression noise, whereas heteroallelic interactions with other promoter variants alleviate these effects. These results uncover new functional properties of natural promoters and suggest the minimization of expression noise as an important factor in promoter evolution."

The reads of murine origin result in false positives in mutation analysis of DNA samples and obscure gene expression levels when sequencing RNA. However, currently available algorithms are limited and improvements in accuracy and ease of use are necessary.RESULTS: We developed the R-package XenofilteR, which separates mouse from human sequence reads based on the edit-distance between a sequence read and reference genome.

This allowed for mutation analysis of xenograft samples with accurate variant allele frequencies, and retrieved all non-synonymous somatic tumor mutations.CONCLUSIONS: XenofilteR accurately dissects RNA and DNA sequences from mouse and human origin, thereby outperforming currently available tools.

The easyGWAS tool supports multiple species, the uploading of private genotype data and summary statistics of existing GWAS, as well as advanced methods for comparing GWAS results across different experiments and data sets in an interactive and user-friendly interface. easyGWAS is also a public data repository for GWAS data and summary statistics and already includes published data and results from several major GWAS. We demonstrate the potential of easyGWAS with a case study of the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana, using flowering and growth-related traits."

STEF down-regulation also reduces perinuclear pMLC and decreases myosin-generated tension at the nuclear envelope, suggesting that STEF-mediated Rac1 activity regulates NMMIIB activity to promote stabilisation of the perinuclear actin cap. Finally, STEF depletion decreases nuclear stiffness and reduces expression of TAZ-regulated genes, indicating an alteration in mechanosensing pathways as a consequence of disruption of the actin cap. | We show that STEF depletion reduces apical perinuclear actin cables (a phenotype rescued by targeting active Rac1 to the nuclear envelope), increases nuclear height and impairs nuclear re-orientation."

Modelling of identified mutations showed that they inactivate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of HUWE1. Genetic deletion of Huwe1 rapidly accelerated tumourigenic in mice carrying loss of the intestinal tumour suppressor gene Apc, with a dramatic increase in tumour initiation. Mechanistically, this phenotype was driven by increased MYC and rapid DNA damage accumulation leading to loss of the second copy of Apc The increased levels of DNA damage sensitised Huwe1-deficient tumours to DNA-damaging agents and to deletion of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1. Taken together, these data identify HUWE1 as a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in the intestinal epithelium and suggest a potential vulnerability of HUWE1-mutated tumours to DNA-damaging agents and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins."

LEM-3 locally processes chromatin bridges that arise from incomplete DNA replication, unresolved recombination intermediates, or the perturbance of chromosome structure. Proper LEM-3 midbody localization and function is regulated by AIR-2/Aurora B kinase.

However, the method cannot accurately estimate duplicated genes expression. Several strategies have been previously used (drop duplicated genes, distribute uniformly the reads, or estimate expression), but all of them provide biased results. Mmquant is a tool for computing gene expression, including duplicated genes. If a read maps at different positions, the tool detects that the corresponding genes are duplicated; it merges the genes and creates a merged gene. The counts of ambiguous reads is then based on the input genes and the merged genes. Other methods have been developed that use weighted allocation of read counts but these methods treat the different types of multi-reads equivalently. For instance a hierarchical approach was developed for allocation of read counts that first resolves ambiguities among genes, then among isoforms, and lastly between alleles. The model has been implemented in EMASE software (Expectation-Maximization for Allele Specific Expression) to estimate total gene expression, isoform usage and ASE based on this hierarchical allocation.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29444201 | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28915787,2,6,"mmquant: how to count multi-mapping reads? | RNA-Seq is currently used routinely, and it provides accurate information on gene transcription.

Here, using complementary whole-exome sequencing, high-density imputation, and in vitro cellular assays, we identify candidate core genes in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Using extreme-phenotype sampling, we sequenced the exomes of 30 SLE parent-affected-offspring trios and identified 14 genes with missense de novo mutations (DNM), none of which are within the >80 SLE susceptibility loci implicated through genome-wide association studies. In a follow-up cohort of 10, 995 individuals of matched European ancestry, we imputed genotype data to the density of the combined UK10K-1000 genomes Phase III reference panel across the 14 candidate genes. Gene-level analyses indicate three functional candidates: DNMT3A, PRKCD, and C1QTNF4. We identify a burden of rare variants across PRKCD associated with SLE risk (P = 0.0028), and across DNMT3A associated with two severe disease prognosis sub-phenotypes (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.0033). We further characterise the TNF-dependent functions of the third candidate gene C1QTNF4 on NF-κB activation and apoptosis, which are inhibited by the p.His198Gln DNM.

Notably, all of them are affected by global developmental delay with speech impairment and intellectual disability; however, none displayed overt clinical signs of immune deficiency. Six frameshift mutations, two nonsense mutations, one missense mutation, and two chromosomal rearrangements resulting in diminished BCL11B expression, arose de novo. A further frameshift mutation was transmitted from a similarly affected mother. Interestingly, the most severely affected patient harbours a missense mutation within a zinc-finger domain of BCL11B, probably affecting the DNA-binding structural interface, similar to the recently published patient. Furthermore, the most C-terminally located premature termination codon mutation fails to rescue the progenitor cell proliferation defect in hippocampal slice cultures from Bcl11b-deficient mice. Concerning the role of BCL11B in the immune system, extensive immune phenotyping of our patients revealed alterations in the T cell compartment and lack of peripheral type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), consistent with the findings described in Bcl11b-deficient mice. Unsupervised analysis of 102 T lymphocyte subpopulations showed that the patients clearly cluster apart from healthy children, further supporting the common aetiology of the disorder. Taken together, we show here that mutations leading either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay. In addition, we suggest that missense mutations affecting specific sites within zinc-finger domains might result in distinct and more severe clinical outcomes."

MTI also needs to be expanded through the use of full text, when and where it is available, to provide coverage of indexing terms that are typically only found in the full text.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28231809,1,12,"12 years on - Is the NLM medical text indexer still useful and relevant? | Facing a growing workload and dwindling resources, the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) created the Indexing Initiative project in 1996. This cross-library team's mission is to explore indexing methodologies for ensuring quality and currency of NLM document collections. The NLM Medical Text Indexer (MTI) is the main product of this project and has been providing automated indexing recommendations since 2002. After all of this time, the questions arise whether MTI is still useful and relevant.METHODS: To answer the question about MTI usefulness, we track a wide variety of statistics related to how frequently MEDLINE indexers refer to MTI recommendations, how well MTI performs against human indexing, and how often MTI is used. To answer the question of MTI relevancy compared to other available tools, we have participated in the 2013 and 2014 BioASQ Challenges. The BioASQ Challenges have provided us with an unbiased comparison between the MTI system and other systems performing the same task.RESULTS: Indexers have continually increased their use of MTI recommendations over the years from 15.75% of the articles they index in 2002 to 62.44% in 2014 showing that the indexers find MTI to be increasingly useful. The MTI performance statistics show significant improvement in Precision (+0.2992) and F1 (+0.1997) with modest gains in Recall (+0.0454) over the years. MTI consistency is comparable to the available indexer consistency studies. MTI performed well in both of the BioASQ Challenges ranking within the top tier teams.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded. The BioASQ Challenge results have shown that we need to incorporate more machine learning into MTI while still retaining the indexing rules that have earned MTI the indexers' trust over the years. We also need to expand MTI through the use of full text, when and where it is available, to provide coverage of indexing terms that are typically only found in the full text. The role of MTI at NLM is also expanding into new areas, further reinforcing the idea that MTI is increasingly useful and relevant."

The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. | The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging.

This research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan. | We investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual."
19398929,pubmedqa,Can the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp predict a neoplastic polyp?,Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.,,0,2,"Cholecystectomy for GB polyps that are larger than 10 mm is generally recommended because of the high probability of neoplasm. In contrast, a follow-up strategy is preferred for GB polyps smaller than 10 mm. However, there are no treatment guidelines for polyps that grow in size during the follow-up period.STUDY: We retrospectively investigated 145 patients with GB polyps who underwent at least 1 ultrasonographic follow-up examination over an interval greater than 6 months, before cholecystectomy at Samsung medical center, South Korea, from 1994 to 2007. The growth rate was determined based on the change in size per time interval between 2 ultrasonographic examinations (mm/mo). | The median age of the patients was 48 years (range: 25 to 75). One hundred twenty-five non-neoplastic polyps and 20 neoplastic polyps were found. Neoplastic polyps were more frequently found in patients older than 60 years, those with hypertension, a polyp size greater than 10 mm, and a rapid growth rate greater than 0.6 mm/mo. On multivariate analysis, however, the growth rate was not related to the neoplastic nature of a polyp, but older age (>60 y) and large size (>10 mm) were significantly associated with neoplastic polyps."

Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency. Fondaparinux may have a role in bridge therapy for these patients."

Deliberate efforts should be directed to restructuring the Kenyan health system to address access barriers and ensure that all Kenyans benefit from health care when they need it.,,0,3,"The 58th World Health Assembly called for all health systems to move towards universal coverage where everyone has access to key promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative health interventions at an affordable cost. Universal coverage involves ensuring that health care benefits are distributed on the basis of need for care and not on ability to pay. The distribution of health care benefits is therefore an important policy question, which health systems should address. The aim of this study is to assess the distribution of health care benefits in the Kenyan health system, compare changes over two time periods and demonstrate the extent to which the distribution meets the principles of universal coverage. | Two nationally representative cross-sectional households surveys conducted in 2003 and 2007 were the main sources of data. A comprehensive analysis of the entire health system is conducted including the public sector, private-not-for-profit and private-for-profit sectors. Standard benefit incidence analysis techniques were applied and adopted to allow application to private sector services."
23497210,pubmedqa,Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?,"No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.",,0,3,"Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant. | Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression."

The purposes of this study are to report the alveolar process thickness and inter-radicular space in the posterior region of the mandible, to assess the impact of different miniscrew insertion angle protocols, and to identify differences between the genders or types of malocclusion. | In this retrospective study, 100 individuals were selected for orthodontic treatment at a radiology clinic. Cone-beam computed tomography data were imported into 3-dimensional software. The predictor variable was the location in the mandible and insertion angle. The demographic variables collected included age, gender, and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45°, 60°, and 90° in relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests. To compare the inter-radicular space and the thickness of bone between areas, an analysis of variance for repeated measures was used."

Is there any correlation with Parkinson's disease?,"Our results do not support the hypothesis of a link between essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. However, it appears that ET patients have a small degree of striatal dopaminergic degeneration. If this is due to alterations in the nigrostriatl pathway or of other origin it is not clear. Follow-up studies of essential tremor patients are warranted to assess progression of disease and to understand better the possible cause for striatal dopaminergic degeneration.",,0,3,"The differential diagnosis between essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) may be, in some cases, very difficult on clinical grounds alone.

Ioflupane, N-u-fluoropropyl-2a-carbomethoxy-3a-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane, also called FP-CIT, labelled with (123)I (commercially known as DaTSCAN) has been proven to be useful in the differential diagnosis between PD and ET and to confirm dopaminergic degeneration in patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this study is to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT (123)I-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs. | Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were included for comparison with ET.
