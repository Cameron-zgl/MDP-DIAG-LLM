Common goods for health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/common-goods-for-health,"Common goods for health are population-based functions or interventions that require collective financing, either from governments or donors based on the following conditions: Contribute to health and economic progress; There is a clear economic rationale for interventions based on market failures, with focus on (i) Public Goods (Non-Rival, Non-Exclusionary) or (ii) large social externalities. These common goods for health are fundamental to protecting and promoting health and well-being. Due to the broad-based benefits of these goods, related externalities, and often multisectoral nature, targeted action and investments are necessary by both governments and the global community. Common goods for health generally fall into five categories: Policy and Coordination (ex. disease control policies and strategies) Taxes and Subsidies (ex. taxes on products with impact on health to create market signals leading to behaviour change) Regulations and Legislation (ex. environmental regulations and guidelines) Information, analysis & communication* (ex. surveillance systems) Population Services* (ex. medical and solid waste management) *Some may have private goods characteristics and related private financing in certain circumstances. The common goods for health functions and interventions have been grouped into five categories explained below to provide greater clarity for formulating budgets, plans and implementation arrangements. Planning and coordination The formation of national policies, institutional capacities and coordination mechanism across sectors and levels of government. These must be inclusive of all groups and will need to be monitored and formally linked with national budgetary processes. Regulation and legislation Refers to use of a government’s coercive power to impose constraints on organizations and individuals. It includes the full range of legal instruments (such as laws, decrees, orders, codes, administrative rules and guidelines). Taxes and subsidies Financial instruments that influence individual and market behaviour, which can have a considerable impact on population health. Information collection, analysis and communication Involves the collection and analyses of information, and the monitoring of population-level change through a comprehensive and centrally-coordinated information system. Population services Services that impact all of society and are fundamental to public health (such as water and sanitation, waste management, vector control and emergency response operations), but which markets either do not provide or under-provide. Common goods for health are essential to building national and global health security and for making progress towards universal health coverage, including preventing and mitigating epidemic and environmental threats to societies. Well-functioning health systems rely on strong governance, clear regulations and standards, population-based services and coordinated policies, all of which are common goods for health. Common goods for heath provide the economic rationale for why it is necessary for governments to invest in International Health Regulation 2005 capacities for health security and critical functions to ensure progress towards universal health coverage. The common goods for health agenda must be integrated into annual and multiyear budget dialogues as well as health financing and national budget reform dialogues. Financing these cross-cutting functions requires pooled resources, as well as coordination across relevant sectors. Medium-term expenditure frameworks can aid in this coordination and can make sure common goods for health are prioritized over time and across levels of government, even in the face of fiscal and political constraints. Some countries may adjust their public financial management to expand and reprioritize budgetary space to allow funds to flow to these functions.

Social determinants of health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/social-determinants-of-health,"The social determinants of health (SDH) are the non-medical factors that influence health outcomes. They are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life. These forces and systems include economic policies and systems, development agendas, social norms, social policies and political systems. The SDH have an important influence on health inequities - the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries. In countries at all levels of income, health and illness follow a social gradient: the lower the socioeconomic position, the worse the health. The following list provides examples of the social determinants of health, which can influence health equity in positive and negative ways: Income and social protection Education Unemployment and job insecurity Working life conditions Food insecurity Housing, basic amenities and the environment Early childhood development Social inclusion and non-discrimination Structural discrimination, conflict and displacement of peoples Access to affordable health services of decent quality. Research shows that the social determinants can be more important than health care or our genes in influencing health. For example, numerous studies suggest that SDH account for more than half of health and wellbeing. In addition, estimates show that the contribution of sectors outside health to population health outcomes exceeds the contribution from the health sector. Addressing SDH appropriately is fundamental for improving health and reducing longstanding inequities in health, which requires action by all sectors and civil society.   There are challenges to overcome in implementing action to address health inequities through the social determinants of health. The social determinants of health equity is a complex and multifaceted field. It involves a wide range of stakeholders within and beyond the health sector and all levels of government. In addition, social determinants of health data can be difficult to collect and share. While the evidence base on the social determinants of health has strengthened during the past decade, the evidence base on what works needs to be strengthened and good practices disseminated effectively. Three areas for critical action identified in the report of the Global Commission on Social Determinants of Health reflect their importance in tackling inequities in health. These include: Improve daily living conditions: The circumstances in which people are born, grow, live, work and age; Tackle the inequitable distribution of power, money and resources: The structural drivers of those conditions of daily life (for example, macroeconomic and urbanization policies and governance); Measure and understand the problem and assess the impact of action: Expand the knowledge base, develop a workforce that is trained in the social determinants of health, and raise public awareness about the social determinants of health. Scaled up and systematic action is required that is universal but proportionate to the disadvantage across the social gradient. This is necessary for effective delivery to addressing inequities in health and promoting healthier populations. Life expectancy and healthy life expectancy have increased, but unequally. There remain persistent and widening gaps between those with the best and worst health and well-being. Poorer populations systematically experience worse health than richer populations. For example: There is a difference of 18 years of life expectancy between high- and low- income countries; In 2016, the majority of the 15 million premature deaths due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) occurred in low- and middle-income countries; Relative gaps within countries between poorer and richer subgroups for diseases like cancer have increased in all regions across the world; The under-5 mortality rate is more than eight times higher in Africa than the European region. Within countries, improvements in child health between poorest and richest subgroups have been impaired by slower improvements for poorer subgroups. Such trends within and between countries are unfair, unjust and avoidable. Many of these health differences are caused by the decision-making processes, policies, social norms and structures which exist at all levels in society. Inequities in health are socially determined, preventing poorer populations from moving up in society and making the most of their potential. Pursuing health equity means striving for the highest possible standard of health for all people and giving special attention to the needs of those at greatest risk of poor health, based on social conditions. Action requires not only equitable access to healthcare but also means working outside the healthcare system to address broader social well-being and development. “Health equity is defined as the absence of unfair and avoidable or remediable differences in health among population groups defined socially, economically, demographically or geographically”.

Mental health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/mental-health,"Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It has intrinsic and instrumental value and is integral to our well-being. At any one time, a diverse set of individual, family, community and structural factors may combine to protect or undermine mental health. Although most people are resilient, people who are exposed to adverse circumstances – including poverty, violence, disability and inequality – are at higher risk of developing a mental health condition. Many mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively low cost, yet health systems remain significantly under-resourced and treatment gaps are wide all over the world. Mental health care is often poor in quality when delivered. People with mental health conditions often also experience stigma, discrimination and human rights violations.     Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning or risk of self-harm. In 2019, 970 million people globally were living with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depression the most common. Mental health conditions can cause difficulties in all aspects of life, including relationships with family, friends and community. They can result from or lead to problems at school and at work. Globally, mental disorders account for 1 in 6 years lived with disability. People with severe mental health conditions die 10 to 20 years earlier than the general population. And having a mental health condition increases the risk of suicide and experiencing human rights violations. The economic consequences of mental health conditions are also enormous, with productivity losses significantly outstripping the direct costs of care. All WHO Member States are committed to implementing the Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2030 , which aims to improve mental health by strengthening governance, providing community-based care, implementing promotion and prevention strategies, and strengthening information systems, evidence and research. WHO’s World mental health report: transforming mental health for all called on all countries to accelerate progress towards implementing the action plan by deepening the value given to mental health, prioritizing mental health promotion and prevention, and developing networks of community-based services. In 2019, WHO launched the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health (2019–2023): Universal Health Coverage for Mental Health to ensure access to quality and affordable mental health care for 100 million more people in 12 priority countries. WHO’s Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) similarly aims to scale up services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders, especially in low- and middle-income countries. As part of the QualityRights Initiative, WHO has developed a comprehensive package of training and guidance materials to build capacity in implementing a human rights and recovery approach to mental health care.

Radiation,https://www.who.int/health-topics/radiation,"Radiation is energy that travels in the form of waves or particles and is part of our everyday environment. People are exposed to radiation from cosmic rays, as well as to radioactive materials found in the soil, water, food, air and also inside the body. Human-made radiation sources are widely used in medicine, industry, and research. There are two types of radiation: ionizing and non-ionizing radiation.       Ionizing radiation is a type of energy released by atoms that travels in the form of electromagnetic waves (gamma or X-rays) or particles (neutrons, beta or alpha). Ionizing radiation can remove electrons from the atoms, i.e. they can ionize atoms. In terms of natural radiation sources, there are more than 60 different naturally occurring radioactive materials present in the environment, with radon gas being the highest contributor to people’s exposure. Artificial radiation sources are used for nuclear power generation and many other industrial and research applications, with the medical use of ionizing radiation being today the highest contributor to people’s exposure (e.g. diagnostic radiology, image-guided interventions, nuclear medicine and radiotherapy). Non-ionizing radiation is radiation in the part of the electromagnetic spectrum where there is insufficient energy to cause ionization. It includes electric and magnetic fields, radio waves, microwaves, and optical radiation, which consists of infrared, visible, and ultraviolet radiation. Non-ionizing radiation encompasses both natural and human-made sources of electromagnetic fields. Electrical power supplies and appliances are the most common sources of low frequency electric and magnetic fields in our living environment. Everyday sources of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields include telecommunications, broadcasting antennas and microwave ovens. Optical radiation technologies, such as lasers, light bulbs and UV lamps, are used in industry, research and medicine. Non-ionizing radiation also encompasses mechanical waves such as infrasound and ultrasound.                                                                      ",WHO
Scabies,https://www.who.int/health-topics/scabies,"Scabies is one of the commonest dermatological conditions, accounting for a substantial proportion of skin disease in many low- and middle-income countries. Globally, it is estimated to affect more than 200 million people at any time and more than 400 million people every year. Scabies is caused by infestation of the skin with a microscopic mite ( Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis ) characterized by itch and a skin eruption. Scabies is frequently complicated by bacterial skin infection (impetigo). In turn, impetigo may result in abscesses, sepsis and invasive infections with bacteria, most frequently Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes , the latter of which may result in kidney disease and rheumatic heart disease. Scabies also impacts quality of life: itch and visible rash often lead to poor sleep, stigmatization and social exclusion, interrupting school and work attendance. Scabies affects the world’s most disadvantaged populations, especially people living in crowded and impoverished conditions, from island communities in the Pacific to favelas of Latin America, remote and rural communities across Africa and Australia, and displaced populations living in camps. In resource-poor settings, scabies and its complications impose a major cost on health care systems. In high-income countries, cases are sporadic, yet outbreaks in health institutions and vulnerable communities contribute to significant economic costs for national health services.         Scabies mites burrow under the upper layer of the skin to lay their eggs, resulting in intense itching. Characteristics of scabies are papules or burrows in typical locations, including the web spaces of the fingers and toes, wrists, buttocks, breasts in females, and genitals. In young children and the elderly, scabies lesions may also be present on the palms, soles and scalp. The itching and rash cause poor sleep, stigmatization and social exclusion, as well as absenteeism from education and employment, resulting in reduced learning potential for children and economic impacts for families and communities. Presence of redness, pus or crusts may indicate a secondary bacterial infection. This should be differentiated from crusted scabies, a severe form of scabies, that is characterized by thick, scaly, plaques over the skin and, in severe cases, deep fissures. Primary management of affected individuals involves application of a topical scabicide such as 5% permethrin, 0.5% malathion in aqueous base, 10–25% benzyl benzoate emulsion or 5–10% sulfur ointment. Oral ivermectin is also highly effective and is approved in several countries. The safety of ivermectin in pregnant women or children below 15 kg body weight has not been established, so ivermectin should not be used in these groups until more safety data are available. Itch commonly intensifies with effective treatment for 1–2 weeks and treated individuals should be informed accordingly. Because people in the early stage of new infestation may be asymptomatic, it is critical to treat the whole household at the same time as the diagnosed case. Repeating treatment in the time frame appropriate for the chosen medication (typically after 7–14 days) will lead to a higher efficacy, particularly for oral ivermectin, which does not kill mite eggs.

Infodemic,https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic,"An infodemic is too much information including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak. It causes confusion and risk-taking behaviours that can harm health. It also leads to mistrust
    in health authorities and undermines the public health response. An infodemic can intensify or lengthen outbreaks when people are unsure about what they need to do to protect their health and the health of people around them.
    With growing digitization – an expansion of social media and internet use – information can spread more rapidly. This can help to more quickly fill information voids but can also amplify harmful messages. Infodemic management is the systematic use of risk- and evidence-based analysis and approaches to manage the infodemic and reduce its impact on health behaviours during health emergencies. Infodemic management aims to enable good health practices through 4 types of activities: Listening to community concerns and questions Promoting understanding of risk and health expert advice Building resilience to misinformation Engaging and empowering communities to take positive action Subscribe to the Infodemic Management News Flash to receive latest biweekly updates from the team.           Member States have recognized the importance and need of an infodemic response through recent resolutions , coming together in solidarity and responding to calls for actions. Therefore, WHO is building partnerships across all societies to respond to the COVID-19 infodemic and is developing country tools for infodemic management that can be used now and for future infodemics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO has worked with the UN family, tech sector, media, civil society and other amplifying communities to understand concerns, co-develop messages, extend the reach of health information, and to respond to the information needs of communities. WHO has also worked with academia to develop a public health research agenda for infodemic management , and with a diverse group of experts to develop a competency framework and trainings in infodemic management . WHO is championing universal access to credible health information, and building resilience to misinformation for people worldwide. At the same time, more efforts are needed to better understand the scale of the infodemic, and impact of strategies used to manage it, in order to develop new toolkits for countries. Through regional networks, such as the Africa Infodemic Response Alliance, WHO is fostering new approaches to meet changing needs for an evolving health emergency infodemic response. This is providing a foundation for further collaborations to also improve preparedness and early detection of emerging and resurgent health threats. WHO is working with partners across society to strengthen the scientific discipline of infodemiology. The purpose is to build and deliver sustainable tools that health authorities and communities can use to prevent and overcome the harmful impacts caused by infodemics. Through partnerships, WHO works to bolster digital capabilities and leverage social inoculation principles to foster higher digital and health literacy, build resilience to misinformation, and deliver innovative ways to reach communities with reliable health information. Here are a few of those innovations: Developing a public health research agenda that provides guidance for where to invest in research to better understand, measure and respond to infodemics Establishing EARS , an early AI-supported response and social listening tool to help health authorities quickly identify rising narratives and “information voids” that interfere with people getting the information they need to make good health choices Running a weekly aggregate of publicly available social and news media, web analytics and online search data to identify and understand online infodemic-related conversation patterns Conducting visual network analyses to better understand the ecosystems where misinformation is able to thrive Establishing a repository of ~200 active COVID-19 fact-checking groups that verify COVID-19 related claims in more than 40 languages Refining an AI-based infodemic observatory to assess the current status of misinformation and disinformation diffusion To advance progress on infodemiology, WHO regularly convenes the global community for conferences to discuss and chart ways forward on infodemic management topics.

Biologicals,https://www.who.int/health-topics/biologicals,"Biological therapeutics, also referred to as Biologicals, are those class of medicines which are grown and then purified from large-scale cell cultures of bacteria or yeast, or plant or animal cells. Biologicals are a diverse group of medicines which includes vaccines, growth factors, immune modulators, monoclonal antibodies, as well as products derived from human blood and plasma. What distinguishes biologicals from other medicines is that these are generally proteins purified from living culture systems or from blood, whereas other medicines are considered as ‘small molecules’ and are either made synthetically or purified from plants. Due to the differences in their nature and how they are produced, biological therapeutics are regulated, tested, and controlled differently than other medicines. To help ensure their quality, safety, and efficacy, each batch of a biological therapeutic product must be tested extensively at each stage of production in order to ensure consistency with prior batches.  The use of WHO international reference standards helps to further ensure the consistency of a product across many batches as well as to allow the comparability of biologicals between manufacturers and/or countries.  The establishment of general requirements applicable across a diverse range of product classes governing starting materials, manufacturing and regulatory oversight is an essential aspect of this process. Whereas guidelines may be established for specific biologicals to help .     The beneficial impact of biologicals is as diverse as the types of products themselves: Vaccines are one of the most powerful and cost-effective ways to reduce the global burden of disease and are estimated to save 2–3 million lives every year. Some diseases, such as smallpox and two types of polio, have been eradicated thanks to global efforts to vaccinate and control their spread. However, as many transmissible diseases continue to claim millions of lives annually, the development of new vaccines and other biological products, and new methods to improve their quality, potency, safety and efficacy, remain major challenges in the field of public health. Blood products are life-saving products used extensively during surgery, in patients with traumas, or those with bleeding disorders, and in people undergoing chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer.  Most donated blood is fractioned into its separate components so a single unit may be used to help multiple patients in need. There are numerous other biological therapeutics, such as insulin used in the treatment of diabetes, interferons for viral infections and cancer therapy, monoclonal antibodies that are also used in the treatment of some cancers or autoimmune diseases.  This class of agent also includes stem cells and some gene therapies. Together, these products are major human achievements and compelling examples of the power of biologicals in medicine.        WHO works with Member States, Collaborating Centres, partners and experts through its biological standardization programme to develop and revise guidance on biotherapeutic products and to establish international reference standards. The guidelines produced are promoted through their publication on the WHO website, as well as through workshops and training sessions to facilitate their implementation. This outreach has proved valuable in promoting WHO recommendations that promote international harmonization of guidance for biological therapeutics. Similarly, the development and promotion of WHO international reference standards helps ensure that biological therapeutics are standardized between different manufacturers, countries, and laboratories.  They are used extensively in ensuring the quality and efficacy of biologicals, as well as in the calibration of diagnostic tests. Several key programs reflect the importance WHO places on biological medicines as powerful agents to reduce the global burden of disease. These include the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) and the Blood Regulators Network (BRN), which is comprised of leading international authorities on blood, blood products and in vitro diagnostic devices. WHO also celebrates World Immunization Week each April, with associated events aimed at promoting the use and understanding of vaccines and combat vaccine hesitancy around the world.

Pertussis,https://www.who.int/health-topics/pertussis,"Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. In 2018, there were more than 151 000 cases of pertussis globally. Pertussis spreads easily from person to person mainly through droplets produced by coughing or sneezing. The disease is most dangerous in infants, and is a significant cause of disease and death in this age group. The first symptoms generally appear 7 to 10 days after infection. They include a mild fever, runny nose and cough, which in typical cases gradually develops into a hacking cough followed by whooping (hence the common name of whooping cough). Pneumonia is a relatively common complication, and seizures and brain disease occur rarely. People with pertussis are most contagious up to about 3 weeks after the cough begins, and many children who contract the infection have coughing spells that last 4 to 8 weeks. Antibiotics are used to treat the infection.              The best way to prevent pertussis is through immunization. The three-dose primary series diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) (- containing) vaccines decrease the risk of severe pertussis in infancy. In 2018, 86% of the global target population had received the recommended three doses of DTP-containing vaccine during infancy. WHO recommends the first dose be administered as early as 6 weeks of age; with subsequent doses given 4-8 weeks apart, at age 10-14 weeks and 14-18 weeks. A booster dose is recommended, preferably during the second year of life. Based on local epidemiology, further booster doses may be warranted later in life. Vaccination of pregnant women is effective in preventing disease in infants too young to be vaccinated. National programmes may consider vaccination of pregnant women with pertussis-containing vaccine as a strategy additional to routine primary infant pertussis vaccination in countries or settings with high or increasing infant morbidity/mortality from pertussis.

Measles,https://www.who.int/health-topics/measles,"Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. It remains an important cause of death among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. While vaccination has prevented an estimated 60 million deaths between 2000–2023, measles is still common in many developing countries, particularly in parts of Africa and Asia. An estimated 107 500 people died from measles in 2023. The overwhelming majority (more than 95%) of measles deaths occur in countries with low per capita incomes and weak health infrastructures. Member States in all WHO Regions have adopted measles elimination goals. WHO is the lead technical agency responsible for coordination of immunization and surveillance activities supporting all countries to achieve these goals.         Measles is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10–14 days after infection, include high fever, a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards. Severe measles is more likely among poorly nourished young children, especially those with insufficient vitamin A, or whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV/AIDS or other diseases. The most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhoea and related dehydration, and severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia.     Routine measles vaccination for children, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with low routine coverage, are key public health strategies to reduce global measles deaths. The measles vaccine has been in use since the 1960s. It is safe, effective and inexpensive. WHO recommends immunization for all susceptible children and adults for whom measles vaccination is not contraindicated. Reaching all children with 2 doses of measles vaccine, either alone, or in a measles-rubella (MR), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) combination, should be the standard for all national immunization programmes.

Adolescent health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/adolescent-health,"Adolescence is the phase of life between childhood and adulthood, from ages 10 to 19. It is a unique stage of human development and an important time for laying the foundations of good health. Adolescents experience rapid physical, cognitive and psychosocial growth. This affects how they feel, think, make decisions, and interact with the world around them. Despite being thought of as a healthy stage of life, there is significant death, illness and injury in the adolescent years. Much of this is preventable or treatable. During this phase, adolescents establish patterns of behaviour – for instance,
    related to diet, physical activity, substance use, and sexual activity – that can protect their health and the health of others around them, or put their health at risk now and in the future. To grow and develop in good health, adolescents need information, including age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education; opportunities to develop life skills; health services that are acceptable, equitable, appropriate and effective; and safe and
    supportive environments. They also need opportunities to meaningfully participate in the design and delivery of interventions to improve and maintain their health. Expanding such opportunities is key to responding to adolescents’ specific needs
    and rights. Adolescents and youth and COVID-19 Resource bank for adolescent health     There are more adolescents in the world than ever before: 1.3 billion, totalling one sixth of the global population. This number is expected to rise through 2050, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where close to 90% of 10- to 19-year-olds
    live. An estimated 1.1 million adolescents die each year. The leading causes are road traffic injuries, suicide and interpersonal violence. Millions of adolescents also experience illness and injury. Causes of mortality and morbidity among adolescents differ
    by sex and age, and also by geographic region. For 10-14-year-olds, the leading risks for health are related to water, hygiene and sanitation. Risks for 15-19-year-olds are more often related to behaviours, such as alcohol use and unsafe sex. Poor diet and low physical activity are additional challenges
    which begin in childhood and adolescence, as does sexual abuse. Older adolescent girls are disproportionately affected by intimate partner violence. Pregnancy complications and unsafe abortions are the leading causes of death among 15-19-year-old
    girls. Most adolescent mortality and morbidity is preventable or treatable, but adolescents face specific barriers in accessing health information and services. Restrictive laws and policies, parental or partner control, limited knowledge, distance, cost, lack
    of confidentiality, and provider bias can all restrict adolescents from getting the care they need to grow and develop in good health. WHO supports countries to ensure that their national adolescent health responses are evidence-based and take account of the values and preferences of adolescents. Improving the evidence base on adolescent health is crucial. WHO supports countries to improve measurement and  strengthen data, conducts research, and shares best practice. WHO issues evidence-based recommendations that are relevant for – or specific to – adolescents across the full range of health areas including: positive development, communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, sexual and reproductive health including HIV, unintentional injury, violence, and mental health, substance abuse and self-harm. To support the implementation of these recommendations, WHO produces a range of policy and programme support tools. At the heart is the Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!) , which guides national-level policy-makers and programme managers on how to plan, implement, monitor, and evaluate adolescent health programmes. WHO also supports countries to scale up efforts in service delivery, financing and governance, helps to build the capacities of national-level researchers and programmers, and provides technical support for policy and programmes. Adolescents need protection from harm on the one hand, and support to make independent decisions on the other. They have a key role to play in the response to their own health and wellbeing. WHO's 13th General Programme of Work recognizes this and is committed to working with adolescents as central partners to improve adolescent health.

Snakebite envenoming,https://www.who.int/health-topics/snakebite,"Snakebite envenoming is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by toxins in the bite of a venomous snake. Envenoming can also be caused by having venom sprayed into the eyes by certain species of snakes that have the ability to spit venom as a defence measure. Inadequate past efforts to control snakebite envenoming has produced fragmented, inaccurate epidemiological data. Many victims do not attend health centres or hospitals and instead rely on traditional treatments. However, available data show 4.5–5.4 million people get bitten by snakes annually. Of this, 1.8–2.7 million develop clinical illness and 81 000 to 138 000 die from complications. High-risk groups include rural agricultural workers, herders, fishermen, hunters, working children, people living in poorly constructed houses and those with limited access to education and healthcare. Morbidity and mortality occur most frequently among young people and children suffer higher case fatality. Furthermore, women experience increased barriers to accessing medical care in some cultures and pregnant women are extremely vulnerable. An ongoing crisis restricting access to safe, effective antivenom treatment in many regions, and particularly sub-Saharan Africa, is one factor that contributes to the predisposition for seeking help through traditional medicine.         Bites or sprayed venom from venomous snakes can cause a range of acute and serious medical emergencies. Envenoming from different types of snakes can cause different symptoms, some more serious than others. This makes the preparation of correct antivenoms an ongoing problem. Envenoming can cause severe paralysis that may prevent breathing, making immediate medical attention critical. People may also experience bleeding disorders that can lead to fatal haemorrhages or irreversible kidney failure. Severe local tissue destruction may also occur, which can lead to permanent disability and even limb amputation. Children are at higher risk of severe effects due to lower body mass than adults. Most deaths and serious consequences from snake bites are entirely preventable by making safe and effective antivenoms more widely available and accessible, particularly in high-risk areas. High quality snake antivenoms are the only effective treatment to prevent or reverse most of the venomous effects of snake bites. Snake antivenoms are effective treatments to prevent or reverse most of the harmful effects of snakebite envenoming and are included in the WHO list of essential medicines. The availability and accessibility of these antivenoms, along with raising awareness on primary prevention methods among communities and health workers, are the best ways to limit serious consequences and deaths from snakebite envenoming. After a bite by a snake suspected of being venomous, follow these steps: Immediately move away from the area where the bite occurred. Remove anything tight from around the bitten part of the body to avoid harm if swelling occurs. Reassure the victim, as most venomous snake bites do not cause immediate death. Immobilize the person completely and transport the person to a health facility as soon as possible Applying pressure at the bite site with a pressure pad may be suitable in some cases. Avoid traditional first aid methods or herbal medicines. Paracetamol may be given for local pain (which can be severe). Vomiting may occur, so place the person on their left side in the recovery position. Closely monitor airway and breathing and be ready to resuscitate if necessary                                                                    ",WHO
Cardiovascular diseases,https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally,
taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. CVDs are a group
of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart
disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions.
More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and
one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of
age. The most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are
unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. Amongst
environmental risk factors, air pollution is an important factor. The effects
of behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood
pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and
obesity. These “intermediate risks factors” can be measured in primary care
facilities and indicate an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, heart
failure and other complications. Cessation of tobacco use, reduction of salt in the diet, eating more fruit
and vegetables, regular physical activity and avoiding harmful use of alcohol
have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Health policies
that create conducive environments for making healthy choices affordable and
available, as well as improving air quality and reducing pollution, are
essential for motivating people to adopt and sustain healthy behaviours. Identifying those at highest risk of CVDs and ensuring they receive
appropriate treatment can prevent premature deaths. Access to noncommunicable
disease medicines and basic health technologies in all primary health care
facilities is essential to ensure that those in need receive treatment and
counselling.         Heart attack and stroke Often, there are no symptoms of the underlying disease of the blood vessels. A heart attack or stroke may be the first sign of underlying disease. Symptoms of a heart attack include: pain or discomfort in the centre of the chest; and/or pain or discomfort in the arms, the left shoulder, elbows, jaw, or back. In addition the person may experience difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath; nausea or vomiting; light-headedness or faintness; a cold sweat; and turning pale. Women are more likely than men to have shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and back or jaw pain. The most common symptom of a stroke is sudden weakness of the face, arm, or leg, most often on one side of the body. Other symptoms include sudden onset of: numbness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body; confusion, difficulty speaking or understanding speech; difficulty seeing with one or both eyes; difficulty walking, dizziness and/or loss of balance or coordination; severe headache with no known cause; and/or fainting or unconsciousness. People experiencing these symptoms should seek medical care immediately. Rheumatic heart disease Symptoms of rheumatic heart disease include: shortness of breath, fatigue, irregular heartbeats, chest pain and fainting. Symptoms of rheumatic fever (which can cause rheumatic heart disease if not treated) include: fever, pain and swelling of the joints, nausea, stomach cramps and vomiting. WHO supports governments to prevent, manage and monitor CVDs by developing global strategies to reduce the incidence, morbidity and mortality of these diseases. These strategies include reducing risk factors, developing standards of care, enhancing health system capacity to care for patients with CVD, and monitoring disease patterns and trends to inform national and global actions. The risk factors for CVD include behaviours such as tobacco use, an unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol and inadequate physical activity. They also include physiological factors, including high blood pressure (hypertension), high blood cholesterol and high blood sugar or glucose, which are linked to underlying social determinants and drivers such as ageing, income and urbanization.

Meningitis,https://www.who.int/health-topics/meningitis,"Meningitis is a serious infection of the meninges, the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is a devastating disease and remains a major public health challenge. The disease can be caused by many different pathogens including bacteria, fungi or viruses, but the highest global burden is seen with bacterial meningitis. There are four main causes of acute bacterial meningitis: meningococcus, pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus agalactiae , also known as Group B streptococcus (GBS). Meningococcus has the most potential to produce outbreaks and large-scale epidemics. The largest burden of meningococcal meningitis occurs in the meningitis belt, an area of sub-Saharan Africa, which stretches from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. Meningococcal meningitis can affect anyone of any age. Overall, mortality is highest in children younger than 5 years. The route of transmission varies by organism. Most bacteria that cause meningitis are carried in the human nose and throat. They spread from person to person by respiratory droplets or throat secretions. GBS is often carried in the human gut or vagina and can spread from mother to child around the time of birth. Carriage of these organisms is usually harmless and helps build up immunity against infection, but the bacteria occasionally invade the body causing meningitis and sepsis.         The symptoms of meningitis can differ based on the cause, how quickly the disease progresses, how long it lasts, brain involvement, and other serious complications like sepsis. Less frequent symptoms include seizures, coma, and neurological deficits, such as weakness of the limbs. Infants often have different symptoms compared to adults, such as unusual behaviour; irritability; weak, continuous cry; poor feeding, and bulging of the soft spot in their head. Some bacterial pathogens may also account for other symptoms as a result of bloodstream infection, which can quickly lead to sepsis, including cold hands and feet, fast breathing, and low blood pressure. A characteristic, non-blanching skin rash may appear with meningococcal sepsis. Meningitis is a medical emergency and requires urgent medical attention. Antibiotic treatment should be started as soon as possible when bacterial meningitis is suspected. The first dose of antibiotic treatment should not be delayed until the results of the lumbar puncture are available. In non-epidemic settings, intravenous corticosteroids are initiated with the first dose of antibiotics, in order to reduce the inflammatory response and the risk of neurological sequelae and death. If treatment is started prior to the lumbar puncture, it may be difficult to grow the bacteria from the spinal fluid and confirm the diagnosis. However, confirmation of the diagnosis should not delay treatment. Vaccines against meningococcal , pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae disease have been available for many years. These bacteria have several different strains and vaccines are designed to protect against the most harmful ones. No universal vaccine exists. Vaccines against GBS are in development. Intravenous penicillin can be administered to mothers at risk of transmitting GBS to their babies during labour, to prevent their babies developing GBS infection. Post-exposure prophylaxis with antibiotics is given to close contacts of individuals with meningococcal disease to eradicate asymptomatic meningococcal carriage in the nose and decrease the risk of transmission.

Malaria,https://www.who.int/health-topics/malaria,"Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is preventable and curable. There are 5 parasite species that cause malaria in humans, and 2 of these species – Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax – pose the greatest threat. In 2023, nearly half of the world's population was at risk of malaria. While sub-Saharan Africa carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden, the WHO Regions of South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean, Western Pacific, and the Americas also report significant numbers of cases . There were an estimated 263 million cases of malaria in 2023, and the estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 597 000. In 2023, the African Region was home to 94% and 95% of malaria cases and deaths, respectively. Children under 5 years of age are most at risk of severe complications from malaria; in 2023, they accounted for nearly 76% of all malaria deaths in the WHO African Region.         Malaria is an acute febrile illness. In a non-immune individual, symptoms usually appear 10–15 days after the infective mosquito bite. The first symptoms – fever, headache and chills – may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. If not treated within 24 hours, Plasmodium falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness, and lead to death. Children with severe malaria frequently develop one or more of the following symptoms: severe anaemia, respiratory distress in relation to metabolic acidosis, or cerebral malaria. In adults, multi-organ failure is also frequent. In malaria endemic areas, people may develop partial immunity, allowing asymptomatic infections to occur. Some people are at considerably higher risk of contracting malaria and developing severe disease than others. These include infants, children under 5 years of age, pregnant women and patients with HIV and AIDS, as well as non-immune migrants, mobile populations and travellers. National malaria control programmes need to take special measures to protect people at higher risk of malaria infection, taking into consideration their specific circumstances. Malaria is a preventable and treatable disease. Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduces disease and prevents deaths, and also contributes to reducing transmission. The best available treatment, particularly for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, is artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Antimalarial medicines can also be used to prevent malaria. For travellers, malaria can be prevented through chemoprophylaxis, which suppresses the blood stage of malaria infections, thereby preventing malaria disease. Prior to their travel to malaria-endemic countries or regions, individuals should consult their national disease control centres, or other institutions offering travel advice, for information regarding the preventive measures that should be taken. See also the WHO International travel and health WHO recommends protection for all people at risk of malaria with effective malaria vector control.

Transplantation,https://www.who.int/health-topics/transplantation,"Transplantation of human cells, tissues or organs is the best – and often the only – way to save lives for people with serious or life-threatening diseases and injuries. Transplantation involves replacing non-functional cells, tissues or organs with healthy counterparts that are obtained from another individual through voluntary donation during their lifetime or after their death. Access to transplantation varies a lot between countries, as does the safety, quality, efficacy of donation and transplantation of human cells, tissues and organs. Growth and development of transplantation worldwide is highly unequal and faces many challenges including: lack of national strategies for transplantation; inadequate legislation, ethical frameworks and regulation, which may allow for practices such as organ trafficking; lack of donation, processing and transplantation infrastructure; deficient universal health coverage, meaning that access to transplantation is excluded; and low awareness and engagement amongst the public and healthcare professionals. Ethical concerns are a major issue. The shortage of organs can lead to illegal activities, like trafficking in body parts for transplants. Research into alternatives, like using animal products (xenotransplantation) or bioengineered materials, is progressing. These could help reduce the need for human donations but aren’t yet a full replacement. Even when they become available, high costs might limit access. For now, ensuring access to human cells, tissues, and organs for transplantation remains critical.     The benefits of tissue transplantation include survival after severe burn trauma, recovery of movement, closure of chronic wounds, rehabilitation of heart function and restoration of sight. Tissue transplants allow many recipients to return to economically productive lives and promote their independence. Organ transplantation is often the best if not the only treatment for acute and chronic organ failure. Non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and arterial hypertension, combined with various social determinants such as alcoholism and obesity, may lead to chronic kidney disease and liver cirrhosis. In terms of survival, quality of life and cost-effectiveness, kidney transplantation has better outcomes than dialysis. In chronic or acute liver failure, as well as some cardio-respiratory conditions, transplantation is the only option. Over 1.5 million patients have undergone haematopoietic stem cell transplant, primarily for haematological cancer. Its potential for treating non-malignant disorders and genetic diseases such as sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia with this type of transplant is increasingly recognized. Previously, only limited treatment options were available, and with no hope of cure.        Initiated by the Fortieth World Health Assembly, the WHO Guiding principles on human cell, tissue and organ transplantation are a significant contribution to this area of health care, providing an orderly, ethical and acceptable framework for the acquisition and transplantation of human cells, tissues and organs for therapeutic purposes. They were updated in 2020 ( WHA Resolution 63.22 ) to reflect changes in practices and attitudes, and they continue to greatly influence the development of appropriate professional codes and practices, as well as legislation, around the world. Following a WHO report showing a lack of progress in the development of transplantation worldwide, the World Health Assembly adopted a new resolution in 2024 (77.4) on increasing availability, ethical access and oversight of transplantation of human cells, tissues and organs . The resolution calls for: Member States to strengthen regulatory frameworks, integrate transplantation into health care systems, increase deceased donation rates, protect living donors from harm and exploitation, and raise public awareness. WHO to support Member States through the development of a Global strategy on donation and transplantation. WHO acknowledges the different needs and resources of health systems, the importance of respecting previous and current initiatives, and the commonalities among the established transplantation activities. To ensure relevance, it relies on the expertise of its advisory bodies and extended expert consultations, as well as the continued work with collaborating centres and non-State actors.

Diagnostics,https://www.who.int/health-topics/diagnostics,"Diagnostics are the most important tools that empower the health workforce in the identification of diseases or health conditions. They allow the initiation of treatments in order to avoid further complications and costly treatments for patients. Diagnostic services are vital for the prevention, screening, diagnosis, case management, monitoring and treatment or surveillance of communicable, noncommunicable, neglected tropical and rare diseases, injuries and disabilities. Therefore, equitable access to safe, effective and quality assured diagnostics requires a comprehensive health-systems approach that addresses all stages of the access value chain. The term diagnostics includes medical devices, techniques and procedures used for in vitro and in vivo determination of physiological status or presence and characteristics of a disease. Examples of in vitro diagnostics include laboratory tests (such as blood or urine tests); in vivo diagnostics include imaging tests (such as chest radiography, mammography or pelvic ultrasound) and other type of tests such as thermometer, electrocardiogram, pulse oximeters, endoscopes or blood pressure measurement devices. The simplest ones can be self-used, such as pregnancy tests, while others require important infrastructure and a specialized health workforce, like CT scanners.     Diagnostics are important to ensure quality, comprehensive and integrated primary health care and health services everywhere and for everyone. Every medical decision depends on a proper diagnosis, and while diagnostics results influence approximately 70% of healthcare decisions, only 3–5% of healthcare budgets go to diagnostic services. Thus, greater availability and improved access to diagnostics contribute towards health systems strengthening and universal health coverage. Diagnostics contribute to the identification, detection and characterization of infectious and noncommunicable diseases. They also contribute to the monitoring of the burden of diseases as they can be used to collect data for informing public health interventions. Diagnostics are fundamental for identification of pathogens and successful outbreak containment and control strategies. They are the first line of defence against emerging pathogens and the possibility of the re-emergence of eradicated diseases. Diagnostics can be used in clinical studies to develop guidance for clinical care of patients and to monitor the efficacy and effectiveness of medical countermeasures such as treatments or vaccines.        WHO works with Member States, collaborating centres, partners and expert groups to develop and revise guidelines and tools, including norms and standards of all types of diagnostics (in vitro and in vivo). WHO selects priority medical devices required for multiple diseases and health conditions. WHO promotes the Essential in vitro diagnostic list and the Priority medical devices list to assist Member States in developing their own national lists, and to support their access and availability. WHO supports Member States in establishing mechanisms to assess national needs for health technologies, in particular medical devices used to screen, diagnose and monitor diseases and health conditions to assure their availability and use, particularly in low-resource settings. The Organization also support the strengthening of national laboratory systems to deliver timely, safe, and reliable diagnostic test results. This includes plans and frameworks for the provision of laboratory based diagnostic services, laboratory workforce and network development, and optimization of laboratory operations. The Organization assists Member States in addressing access barriers, strengthening regulatory capabilities, and promoting evidence-based decision-making and rational use of health technologies including diagnostics. Furthermore, the Organization leads efforts in innovation and increasing regional capacity in the research and development of priority health products.

Yaws (Endemic treponematoses),https://www.who.int/health-topics/yaws,"Yaws is a chronic skin infection characterized by papillomas (noncancerous lumps) and ulcers. It is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue , which belongs to the same group of bacteria that causes venereal syphilis. Yaws primarily affects children aged under 15 years who live in poor communities in warm, humid and tropical forested areas of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific islands. The majority of affected populations live rural areas, far from health services. Poverty, low socio-economic conditions and poor personal hygiene facilitate the spread of yaws. Although there are over 80 000 cases of yaws each year, experts believe the disease can be controlled and ultimately eradicated for several reasons. First, it only occurs in humans, not animals, making control much easier. It is also easy to treat with readily available drugs and has already been eliminated in some countries, including India. The remaining pockets of yaws infection, although usually in remote places, means further spread is less likely with proper surveillance and control measures.         There are two stages of yaws infection. The early stage is when the patient is infectious and can spread the disease to others. In this stage, a papule (a noncancerous, outward-growing lump) develops at the site of infection. This papule is full of the organisms and may persist for 3–6 months followed by natural healing. Without treatment, this is followed by disseminated skin lesions over the body. Bone pain and bone lesions may also occur. The second stage is noninfectious and typically appears five years after infection. It is characterized by disabling consequences of the nose, bones and palmar/plantar hyperkeratosis (thickening). After a field diagnosis based on these symptoms, the disease can be confirmed by examining a sample from a skin legion under a special type of microscope (darkfield examination). Blood tests are not typically used because yaws is closely related to the bacterium that causes syphilis and the two diseases will show the same result. There is currently no vaccine for yaws. Health education and improved personal hygiene are the most important tactics for prevention. Two antibiotics can be used to treat yaws. A single oral dose of azithromycin (30 mg/kg, maximum 2 g) is the recommended treatment. Benzathine penicillin (single intramuscular dose) at 0.6 million units (children aged under 10 years) and 1.2 million units (people aged over 10 years) can be used for patients with suspected clinical treatment failure after azithromycin, or patients who cannot be treated with azithromycin. This treatment will result in complete clinical healing in 95% of cases but patients should be re-examined 4 weeks after receiving the antibiotics. A review of the historic documents from 1950s shows that over 90 countries and territories were endemic for yaws. Only 14 out of the 90 countries and territories have recent data on yaws based on the routine surveillance system; however, these figures may just be an indication of the presence of the disease and not its full extent. Ghana, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands report over 10 000 cases per year. Ecuador and India appear to have interrupted transmission.                                                                    ",WHO
Ageism,https://www.who.int/health-topics/ageism,"Age is one of the first things we notice about other people. However, age is often used to categorize and divide people in ways that lead to harm, disadvantage and injustice and erode solidarity across generations. This is ageism: the stereotypes (how we think), prejudice (how we feel) and discrimination (how we act) towards others or ourselves based on age. Ageism is pervasive, affects people of all ages from childhood onwards and has serious and far-reaching consequences for people’s health, well-being and human rights. Ageism can be found within institutions, in interactions between people and within ourselves. Globally, 1 in 2 people are ageist against older people and in Europe, younger people report more perceived ageism than other age groups. Ageism remains largely invisible despite its wide reach and negative impact on individuals and society. However, it can be combated: policies and laws, educational activities and intergenerational interventions have all been proven to work to reduce ageism. To create a world for all ages, stakeholders across countries, sectors and disciplines must invest in these three strategies, support further research and data collection in this area and join the global movement to change negative narratives around age and ageing.     Ageism has far-reaching impacts on all aspects of our health and well-being when we are older: It is associated with earlier death. It is linked to poorer physical health,      affecting, among others, our ability to recover from disability and our      sexual and reproductive health. It increases risky health behaviours (e.g.,      eating an unhealthy diet, smoking). It is associated with poorer mental health,      including the onset of depression, increases in depressive symptoms over      time and lifetime depression. It is associated with a lower quality of life      and contributes to social isolation and loneliness. Ageism also takes a heavy economic toll on individuals and society and exacerbates other forms of disadvantage. More research is required to better understand both the impact that ageism has in earlier stages of life and cumulatively over the life-course. WHO has been requested by its 194 Member States to work across sectors and stakeholder groups to establish a Global Campaign to Combat Ageism. The Campaign envisions a world for all ages and aims to turn this vision into reality by changing how we all think, feel and act towards age and ageing. To do so, WHO works together with key partners to: generate an evidence base on ageism to better      understand what ageism is, why it matters and how we can address it; build a global coalition to coordinate efforts      to prevent and respond to ageism, improve data collection and enable      sharing of knowledge in this area of work; and deliver and develop awareness raising events,      capacity building programmes and tools to enable others to spread the word      about ageism and challenge it when they encounter it.

Blood products,https://www.who.int/health-topics/blood-products,"A blood product is any therapeutic substance derived from human blood, including whole blood and other blood components for transfusion, and plasma-derived medicinal products (PDMPs). Medicinal (medical therapeutic) products derived from human donations of blood and plasma play a critical role in health care. Safe, effective and quality-assured blood products contribute to improving and saving millions of lives every year, as they: address child mortality and maternal health; dramatically improve the life expectancy and quality of life of patients suffering from life-threatening inherited disorders, such as haemophilia, thalassaemia and immune deficiency, and acquired conditions such as cancer and traumatic haemorrhage; and support complex medical and surgical procedures, including transplantation. An insufficient or unsafe blood supply for transfusion has a negative impact on the effectiveness of key health services and programmes to provide appropriate patient care in numerous acute and chronic conditions. Ensuring access of all patients who require transfusion to safe, effective and quality-assured blood products is a key component of an effective health system and vital for patient safety.     Blood products contribute to the saving of millions of lives every year,
    improve dramatically life expectancy and the quality of life of patients

    surgical procedures. In high-income countries, blood products are most commonly used to support
    advanced medical and surgical procedures, including treatments of cancer and
    haematological diseases, trauma resuscitation, cardiovascular surgery and
    transplantation. In lower-income countries where diagnosis and treatment
    options are limited, a greater portion of blood is used to treat women with
    obstetric emergencies and children suffering from severe anaemia, often
    resulting from malaria and malnutrition. In many countries, demand outstrips supply, and blood services throughout
    the world face the daunting challenge of making sufficient supplies of blood

Cervical cancer,https://www.who.int/health-topics/cervical-cancer,"Cervical cancer develops in a woman's cervix (the entrance to the uterus from the vagina). Almost all cervical cancer cases (99%) are linked to infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV), an extremely common virus transmitted through sexual contact. Although most infections with HPV resolve spontaneously and cause no symptoms, persistent infection can cause cervical cancer in women. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women. In 2022, an estimated 660 000 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer worldwide and about 350 000 women died from the disease. Effective primary (HPV vaccination) and secondary prevention approaches (screening for, and treating precancerous lesions) will prevent most cervical cancer cases. When diagnosed, cervical cancer is one of the most successfully treatable forms of cancer, as long as it is detected early and managed effectively. Cancers diagnosed in late stages can also be controlled with appropriate treatment and palliative care. With a comprehensive approach to prevent, screen and treat, cervical cancer can be eliminated as a public health problem within a generation.               No woman should die from cervical cancer. We have the technical, medical and policy tools and approaches to eliminate it. The burden of cervical cancer falls on the women who lack access to health services, mainly in low-and middle income countries. In May 2018, the Director-General
of  the World Health Organization announced a global call to action towards the elimination of cervical cancer, underscoring renewed political will to make elimination a reality, and called for all stakeholders to unite behind this common goal.

Radiation emergencies,https://www.who.int/health-topics/radiation-emergencies,"Radiation emergencies are non-routine situations or events that require a prompt action to mitigate a radio-nuclear hazard or its adverse consequences for human life, health, property or the environment. Nuclear emergencies involve release of the energy resulting from a nuclear chain reaction or from the decay of the products of chain reaction (e.g. nuclear power plant accidents such as Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents).  Radiological emergencies are situations involving a radiation exposure from a radioactive source. When referring to an emergency situation regardless of its type, “radiation emergency” term is often used. Radiation emergencies may result from misuse of radioactive sources during industrial, medical or research applications, accidental exposure to uncontrolled (abandoned, lost or stolen) radiation sources, accidents during transport of radioactive materials, but also can be combined with conventional emergencies (a fire or a release of chemical substances), natural disasters, military conflicts, or malicious acts involving radiation sources.     Radiation emergencies can greatly impact human health and  the environment. The impact will vary considerably, depending on the scenario, scale of the emergency, type of radiation and exposure duration, the pathway of the exposure (external, internal, or combined), availability and timeliness of countermeasures, as well as individual characteristics of the exposed person (age, gender, underlying state of health). As a result, people may be exposed to radiation levels ranging from very low doses not resulting in any clinical manifestations of such exposure, to higher doses which may cause radiation injuries (a.k.a. “tissue reactions”) or even be fatal. The risk of health effects increases with the radiation dose. Workers at nuclear installations, first responders and fire-fighters are at higher risk of being over-exposed to radiation and receiving radiation injures, whereas, for the majority of people affected by the consequences of a nuclear emergency, it will be unlikely to suffer the direct impact of radiation. In addition, urgent protective actions implemented in response to a radiation emergency, such as sheltering, evacuation, or resettling from contaminated areas, restrictions on locally produced foodstuffs etc. may also lead to negative socio-economic impact on the human lives and the society as a whole. Losing homes and jobs, lack of access to a regular health care, stigmatization of evacuees and other hardship may further impact people’s health through severe stress, anxiety, fatigue, depression, and other mental health and psychosocial consequences. As a full party to the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency , WHO has a mandate to provide technical assistance and advice on public health measures and medical countermeasures. The IAEA provides Secretariat for the Convention and for the Inter-Agency Committee for Radiological and Nuclear Emergencies (IACRNE) that brings together more than 20 international organizations for coordination of their work on preparedness and response to radiation emergencies. The roles of IACRNE member organizations are described in the Joint Radiation Emergency Management Plan of the International Organizations . To fulfill its mandate under these Conventions, WHO established in 1987 the Radiation Emergency Medical Preparedness and Assistance Network (REMPAN) to enhance preparedness for radiation emergencies and to advise health authorities on medical and public health response in the event of a radiation emergency. The Network is WHO’s technical arm for implementing capacity building activities in member states and for providing technical assistance in case of radiation emergencies. In addition, a global network of cytogenetic laboratories WHO BioDoseNet was set up in 2008 to support biological dosimetry capacity of member states readiness for a mass-casualty type of a radiation emergency.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),https://www.who.int/health-topics/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a SARS-coronavirus. While SARS cases were detected as early as November 2002 as part of an outbreak that emerged in China and subsequently spread to 28 other countries, the pathogen causing the disease was identified as a coronavirus at the end of February 2003. WHO coordinated the international investigation with the assistance of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and worked closely with health authorities in affected countries to provide epidemiological, clinical and logistical support and to bring the outbreak under control. SARS-CoV-1 (the number 1 was added later to distinguish it from the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2) is a respiratory virus which can spread through the air through small infectious respiratory particles. It was the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21 st century and spread along respiratory routes and cause an epidemic through international air travel of people to other countries outside of its originating country. SARS can also be transmitted indirectly through deposition of the virus onto surfaces via contaminated surfaces that have been touched by someone who is infected with the virus. Most patients who contracted SARS were previously healthy adults aged 25–70 years. A few suspected cases of SARS have been reported among children under 15 years. The case fatality among persons with illness meeting the current WHO case definition for confirmed cases of SARS is around 9.6%. Following the emergence of COVID-19, evidence-based guidance was published and can be found here . Such guidance will largely apply to SARS as well.         The incubation period of SARS is usually 2–7 days but may be as long as 10 days. The first symptom of the illness is generally fever (>38°C), which is often high, and sometimes associated with chills and rigors. It may also be accompanied by other symptoms including headache, malaise and muscle pain. At the onset of illness, some cases have mild respiratory symptoms. Typically, rash and neurologic or gastrointestinal findings are absent, although a few patients have reported diarrhoea during the early febrile stage. After 3-7 days, a lower respiratory phase begins with the onset of a dry, non-productive cough or dyspnoea (shortness of breath) that may be accompanied by, or progress to, hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels). In 10–20% of cases, the respiratory illness is severe enough to require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Chest radiographs may be normal throughout the course of illness, though not for all patients. The white blood cell count is often decreased early in the disease, and many people have low platelet counts at the peak of the disease. While no treatment or cure was available at the time of the emergence of SARS, the emergence of a closely related disease – COVID-19 – lead to the rapid development of several antivirals and vaccines. Antivirals such as polymerase and protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 are likely to be effective against SARS-CoV-1. COVID-19 vaccines may provide some level of cross-protection against SARS; however, the extent of such cross-protection remains to be studied. Controlling outbreaks relies on containment measures including: prompt detection of cases through good surveillance networks and including an      early warning system; isolation of suspected or probable cases; tracing to identify both the source of the infection and contacts of those who are      sick and may be at risk of contracting the virus; quarantine of suspected contacts for 10 days; exit screening for outgoing passengers from areas with recent local      transmission by asking questions and temperature measurement; and disinfection of aircraft and cruise vessels having SARS cases on board using WHO      guidelines. Personal preventive measures to prevent spread of the virus include frequent hand washing using soap or alcohol-based disinfectants. For those with a high risk of contracting the disease, such as health care workers, use of personal protective equipment, including a mask, goggles and an apron is mandatory.  Whenever possible, household contacts should also wear a mask.

Buruli ulcer  (Mycobacterium ulcerans infection),https://www.who.int/health-topics/buruli-ulcer,"Buruli ulcer is a chronic debilitating disease that mainly affects the skin and sometimes bones. First described by Sir Albert Cook in 1897 in Uganda, it was not until the 1930s that Australian scientists led by Peter MacCallum first succeeded in culturing the organism from lesions of patients from the Bairnsdale region. The name Buruli comes from an area of Uganda where many cases were reported in the 1960s. In Africa, about half of the patients are children under 15 years. In Australia, the average age is around 60 years. In 1998, WHO established the Global Buruli Ulcer Initiative in response to the growing spread of the disease, particularly in West Africa. Buruli ulcer is caused by Mycobacterium and belongs to the family of bacteria that causes tuberculosis and leprosy. Although the causative organism of Buruli ulcer is an environmental bacterium, the mode of transmission to humans remains unknown. The organism produces a unique toxin – mycolactone – that causes the damage to the skin. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to minimizing morbidity, costs and prevent long-term disability.         Symptoms of Buruli ulcer begin with painless nodules and swelling, usually on the arms and legs and sometimes on other parts of the body. These areas can then develop into large ulcers with a white and yellow base. M. ulcerans produces the toxin mycolactone. This has local immunosuppressive properties that enable the disease to progress rapidly with no pain and fever, making early detection difficult. However, if the ulcers are treated quickly, most will heal completely. If diagnosed late or left untreated, the condition can lead to scarring, permanent disfigurement and disability. Buruli ulcer has been reported in 33 countries in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Western Pacific. Most cases occur in tropical and subtropical regions except in Australia, China and Japan. Out of the 33 countries, 14 regularly report data to WHO. The number of annual cases can be found in Global Health Observatory . Treatment consists of a combination of antibiotics and complementary treatments (under morbidity management and disability prevention/rehabilitation). Antibiotics: Current WHO recommendations are rifampicin 10 mg/kg per body weight daily and clarithromycin 7.5 mg/kg per body weight twice daily. Treatment guidance for health workers can be found in the WHO publication Treatment of mycobacterium
ulcerans disease (Buruli ulcer) . Other interventions In addition to the antibiotics and depending on the stage of the disease, other interventions such as wound care, lymphoedema management, surgery (mainly debridement and skin grafting to speed up healing) and physiotherapy are needed. Psychological support
    may also be needed for those with severe disease. These same interventions are applicable to other neglected tropical diseases, such as leprosy and lymphatic filariasis, so it is important to integrate a long-term care approach into the health system to benefit all patients. The integrated approach to
    the control of skin related NTDs provides an opportunity to integrate Buruli ulcer detection and its management with these diseases.                                                                    ",WHO
Brain health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/brain-health,"Brain health is the state of brain functioning across cognitive, sensory,
social-emotional, behavioural and motor domains, allowing a person to realize
their full potential over the life course, irrespective of the presence or
absence of disorders. Different determinants related to physical health, healthy environments,
safety and security, life-long learning and social connection as well as access
to quality services influence the way our brains develop, adapt and respond to
stress and adversity. These give way to strategies for promotion and
prevention across the life course. Optimizing brain health by addressing these determinants not only improves mental and
physical health but also creates positive social and economic impacts that
contribute to greater well-being and help advance society. However, conditions affecting the brain and nervous system in general emerge
throughout the life course and are characterized by disruptions in brain
growth, damage to brain structure and/or impaired brain functioning. These
include for example congenital and neurodevelopmental conditions as well as
neurological disorders across the life. Health and social care for these
conditions require multisectoral and interdisciplinary collaborations with a holistic
person-centred approach focused on promotion, prevention, treatment, care and
rehabilitation and the active engagement of persons with lived experience,
their families and carers.      In May 2022, WHO Member States adopted the Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders 2022–2031 . This action plan aims to improve care, recovery, well-being and participation of people living with neurological disorders across the life-course, while reducing associated mortality, morbidity and disability associated with neurological conditions. In the context of Universal Health Coverage and the UN Sustainable Development Goals and in line with WHO’s existing mandates for conditions affecting the brain such as autism spectrum disorder , epilepsy and dementia , WHO’s brain health work is focused on promoting optimal brain development, cognitive health and well-being across the life course. The main activities involve: strengthening policies, service delivery, health information systems, technology      (including but not limited to artificial intelligence, e-health and big      data), research and innovation, especially in low- and middle-income      countries; providing technical assistance on how to formulate an integrated approach to brain      health conditions focused on promotion, prevention, treatment, care and      rehabilitation, focusing on low- and middle-income countries; and fostering increased investment and inter-agency collaboration globally as well as      the involvement of different specialties and sectors.          The global burden of neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions is high,
with approximately 70% of the burden in low- and middle-income countries.
Neurological conditions are the leading cause of disability adjusted life years
(DALYs) and account for about 9 million deaths per year. The largest contributors of neurological DALYs in 2016 were stroke (42.2%),
migraine (16.3%), dementia (10.4%), meningitis (7.9%) and epilepsy (5%).
Parkinson disease, propelled by an increasingly ageing population, is the
fastest growing neurological disorder. Premature birth, neonatal encephalopathy
and neuroinfections contribute substantially to high disease burden in South-East
Asia and Africa. In 2016, developmental disabilities accounted for 13.3% of the
29.3 million years lived with disability for all health conditions among
children younger than 5 years. Despite the large burden, only 28% of low-income countries have a dedicated
policy for neurological diseases in comparison with 64% of high-income
countries. Available resources for these conditions are insufficient in most
countries, with unacceptably high treatment gaps for many neurological and
neurodevelopmental conditions. For example, in low- and middle-income
countries, there are only three adult neurologists per 10 million people while
high-income countries have approximately 160 times more. Resources for the
assessment and care of children with neurological and neurodevelopmental
conditions are even more scarce.                                                              ",WHO
Substandard and falsified medical products,https://www.who.int/health-topics/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products,"Up to two billion people around the world lack access to necessary medicines, vaccines, medical devices including in vitro diagnostics,  and other health products, which creates a vacuum that is too often filled by substandard and falsified products. This problem is growing as global supply chains become more complex, meaning products manufactured in one country may be packaged in a second country and distributed across borders to be marketed or sold to consumers in a third. The growth of e-commerce also contributes to this trend by making it easier to purchase medicines online, often from unauthorized sources. WHO has identified this issue one of the urgent health challenges for the next decade given that more than one in ten medicines in low- and middle-income countries are estimated to be substandard or falsified. No country remains untouched from this issue, and WHO has received reports of substandard or falsified medical medicines, vaccines and in vitro diagnostics from all regions of the world. Both generic and innovator medicines can be falsified, ranging from very expensive products for cancer to very inexpensive products for treatment of pain. WHO Member States have agreed on a comprehensive global strategy focused on prevention, detection and response to move towards achieving increased access to quality, safe, effective and quality medical products.     Substandard and falsified medical products create many problems for both the individual taking the medicine and for families, the larger society, health care system and supply chain. When medicines do not work the way they should, they can fail to treat
    or prevent disease, contribute to antimicrobial resistance, waste precious resources and lead to a loss of confidence in medicines and distrust of healthcare providers. This can have a negative socioeconomic impact, contributing to related loss in
    productivity and adding expenses to the individual and national health system. They are most likely to reach patients in situations where there is constrained access to quality and safe medical products, poor governance and weak technical capacity. Although this issue impacts all countries, countries where there are weak or non-existent
    regulatory systems bear the greatest burden of substandard and falsified medical products. In an increasingly globalized world, no one country has sufficient resources and capacity to deal with this issue in isolation. Through global systems and processes such as the WHO Global Surveillance and Monitoring System and WHO Member State Mechanism,
    Member States are working together to prevent, detect and respond to substandard and falsified medical products.                                                                         ",WHO
Lead poisoning,https://www.who.int/health-topics/lead-poisoning,"Lead is a naturally occurring toxic metal found in the Earth’s crust. Its widespread use has resulted in extensive environmental contamination, human exposure and significant public health problems in many parts of the world. Important sources of environmental contamination include mining, smelting, manufacturing and recycling activities, and, in some countries, the continued use of leaded paint and leaded aviation fuel. More than three quarters of global lead consumption is for the manufacture of lead-acid batteries for motor vehicles. Lead is, however, also used in many other products, for example pigments, paints, solder, stained glass, lead crystal glassware, ammunition, ceramic glazes, jewellery, toys and some cosmetics and traditional medicines. Drinking water delivered through lead pipes or pipes joined with lead solder may contain lead. Much of the lead in global commerce is now obtained from recycling. Young children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of lead and can suffer profound and permanent adverse health impacts, particularly on the development of the brain and nervous system. Lead also causes long-term harm in adults, including increased risk of high blood pressure and kidney damage. Exposure of pregnant women to high levels of lead can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth and low birth weight.         Lead is a well-recognized toxicant that has wide-ranging health impacts, affecting the neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and haematological systems. Young children are particularly vulnerable because they have higher exposures than adults and because lead affects the developing brain, potentially resulting in reduced intellectual ability. Lead in the body is distributed to the brain, liver, kidney and bones. It is stored in the teeth and bones, where it accumulates over time. Lead in bone is released into blood during pregnancy and becomes a source of exposure to the developing fetus. Human exposure is usually assessed through the measurement of lead in blood. There is no known safe blood lead concentration; even blood lead concentrations as low as 5 µg/dL may be associated with decreased intelligence in children, behavioural difficulties and learning problems. As lead exposure increases, the range and severity of symptoms and effects also increase. Encouragingly, the successful phasing out of leaded gasoline in most countries, together with other lead control measures, has resulted in a significant decline in population-level blood lead concentrations. As of July 2021, leaded fuel for cars and lorries is no longer sold anywhere in the world. However, more needs to be done to phase out of lead paint: so far, only 43% of countries have introduced legally binding controls on lead paint. Diagnosis of lead poisoning and treatment decisions are based on medical history, clinical examination and the results of investigations, including the blood lead concentration, biomarkers of effect such as a full blood count and, if relevant, medical imaging. If the patient is clinically well, surgical removal is not necessary, but the blood lead concentration should be measured periodically to check for lead absorption. Treatment options should be reviewed if the patient becomes symptomatic or if the blood lead concentration starts rising. The systematic reviews of evidence identified few good-quality studies of the effectiveness of the treatment interventions for lead exposure, and more evidence would increase the certainty of the recommendations. Confirmation of exposure to lead should be followed by termination of that exposure, as without this measure lead will continue to exert its toxic effects.  When blood-lead levels are high and the patient has significant features of lead toxicity, chelation therapy to facilitate lead excretion may improve health outcomes. Gastrointestinal decontamination and nutritional supplementation may also play a role in treatment in specific circumstances.                                                                    ",WHO
Drowning,https://www.who.int/health-topics/drowning,"Drowning is the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from immersion in liquid. Outcomes are classified as death, morbidity and no morbidity. Drowning is a leading killer. The Global status report on drowning prevention shows that over 300 000 people lost their lives to drowning in 2021, Drowning disproportionately impacts children and young people. Children aged under 5 years account for nearly a quarter of all drowning deaths, and more than half of deaths occur among people aged under 30 years. Over 90% of drowning deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Drowning prevention interventions range from community-based solutions, such as day care for children and barriers controlling access to water, to effective national policies and legislation around water safety, including setting and enforcing boating, shipping and ferry regulations. While significant progress has been made in reducing drowning deaths, much more needs to be done. Everyone should have safe access to water and be able to enjoy water safely.             WHO produces a range of technical
resources to guide and inform drowning prevention efforts around the world.
These include the Global status report on
drowning prevention , which details the scale of global drowning
fatalities and progress made in advancing strategies and actions to reduce
drowning, Practical
guidelines on the provision of day-care, basic swimming and water safety
skills, and safe rescue and resuscitation training , and the first
investment case on drowning prevention , which highlights the financial
return of two crucial measures: teaching school-aged children swimming and
water safety skills and providing safe spaces with adult supervision for
pre-school children. At the regional level, WHO
organizes training programmes and convenes workshops to bring together
representatives of governments, NGOs and UN agencies working on drowning
prevention. At the country level, WHO works with Ministries of Health to
prevent drowning through the use of barriers controlling access to water and
the establishment of day care centres for pre-school children. In addition, WHO
has funded research in low-income countries exploring priority questions
related to drowning prevention. There are many actions to prevent drowning. Installing barriers (e.g. covering wells, using doorway barriers and playpens, fencing swimming pools etc.) to control access to water hazards, or removing water hazards entirely greatly reduces water hazard exposure and risk. Community-based, supervised child care for pre-school children can reduce drowning risk and has other proven health benefits. Teaching school-age children basic swimming, water safety and safe rescue skills is another approach. But these efforts must be undertaken with an emphasis on safety, and an overall risk management that includes a safety-tested curricula, a safe training area, screening and student selection, and student-instructor ratios established for safety. Effective policies and legislation are also important for drowning prevention. Setting and enforcing safe boating, shipping and ferry regulations is an important part of improving safety on the water and preventing drowning. Building resilience to flooding and managing flood risks through better disaster preparedness planning, land use planning, and early warning systems can prevent drowning during flood disasters. Developing a national water safety strategy can raise awareness of safety around water, build consensus around solutions, provide strategic direction and a framework to guide multisectoral action and allow for monitoring and evaluation of efforts.

Newborn health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/newborn-health,"To ensure every child survives and thrives to reach their full potential, we must focus on improving care around the time of birth and the first week of life. The high rates of preventable death and poor health and well-being of newborns and children under the age of five are indicators of the uneven coverage of life-saving interventions and, more broadly, of inadequate social and economic development. Poverty, poor nutrition and insufficient access to clean water and sanitation are all harmful factors, as is insufficient access to quality health services such as essential care for newborns. Health promotion, disease prevention services (such as vaccinations) and treatment of common childhood illnesses are essential if children are to thrive as well as survive.     Newborn deaths account for 47% of deaths among children under the age of 5 globally, resulting in 2.4 million lives lost each year. About one third of newborn deaths occur on the day of birth and close to three quarters occur within the first week of life. In addition, almost 2 million babies born with no signs of life at 28 weeks of pregnancy or more (stillbirths) and 295 000 maternal deaths occur each year. Children who die within the first 28 days of birth suffer from conditions and diseases associated with lack of quality care at birth or skilled care and treatment immediately after birth and in the first days of life. The vast majority of newborn deaths take place in low and middle-income countries.        In 2014, 194 Member States of the Sixty-seventh World Health Assembly endorsed the action plan (Resolution WHA67.10). Led by UNICEF and the World Health Organization, Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) was guided by the advice of experts and partners and by multistakeholder consultations and a web-based consultation with over 300 comments from stakeholders. The WHO Director-General has been requested to monitor progress towards the achievement of the global goal and targets, reporting periodically to the World Health Assembly until 2030. Twenty-eight focus countries were targeted for data collection through the use of a progress tracking tool. This systematic tracking of progress enables the assessment of the status of implementation of ENAP strategies, maps technical assistance needs and identifies barriers to implementation in line with the ENAP milestones and recommendations. Another area of work is the Quality of Care Network. The main objective of the network is broadening the focus from access to care to include quality of care for maternal, newborn and child health to cut preventable maternal and newborn illness and deaths, and to improve every mother’s experience of care.

Breastfeeding,https://www.who.int/health-topics/breastfeeding,"Breastfeeding is one of the most effective ways to ensure child health and survival. However, contrary to WHO recommendations, fewer than half of infants under 6 months old are exclusively breastfed. Breastmilk is the ideal food for infants. It is safe, clean and contains antibodies which help protect against many common childhood illnesses. Breastmilk provides all the energy and nutrients that the infant needs for the first months of life, and it continues to provide up to half or more of a child’s nutritional needs during the second half of the first year, and up to one third during the second year of life. Breastfed children perform better on intelligence tests, are less likely to be overweight or obese and less prone to diabetes later in life. Women who breastfeed also have a reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Inappropriate marketing of breast-milk substitutes continues to undermine efforts to improve breastfeeding rates and duration worldwide. Learn about Nutrition and Food Safety and COVID-19      WHO actively promotes breastfeeding as the best source of nourishment for infants and young children, and is working to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months up to at least 50% by 2025. WHO and UNICEF created the Global Breastfeeding Collective to rally political, legal, financial, and public support for breastfeeding. The Collective brings together implementers and donors from governments, philanthropies, international organizations, and civil society. WHO’s Network for Global Monitoring and Support for Implementation of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, also known as NetCode, works to ensure that breast-milk substitutes are not marketed inappropriately. Additionally, WHO provides training courses for health workers to provide skilled support to breastfeeding mothers, help them overcome problems, and monitor the growth of children.           WHO and UNICEF recommend that children initiate breastfeeding within the first hour of birth and be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life – meaning no other foods or liquids are provided, including water. Infants should be breastfed on demand – that is as often as the child wants, day and night. No bottles, teats or pacifiers should be used. From the age of 6 months, children should begin eating safe and adequate complementary foods while continuing to breastfeed for up to two years of age or beyond.

"Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)",https://www.who.int/health-topics/water-sanitation-and-hygiene-wash,"Safe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene are crucial to human health and well-being. Safe WASH is not only a prerequisite to health, but contributes to livelihoods, school attendance and dignity and helps to create resilient communities living in healthy environments. Drinking unsafe water impairs health through illnesses such as diarrhoea, and untreated excreta contaminates groundwaters and surface waters used for drinking-water, irrigation, bathing and household purposes. Chemical contamination of water continues to pose a health burden, whether natural in origin such as arsenic and fluoride, or anthropogenic such as nitrate. Safe and sufficient WASH plays a key role in preventing numerous NTDs such as trachoma, soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis. Diarrhoeal deaths as a result of inadequate WASH were reduced by half during the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) period (1990–2015), with the significant progress on water and sanitation provision playing a key role. Evidence suggests that improving service levels towards safely managed drinking-water or sanitation such as regulated piped water or connections to sewers with wastewater treatment can dramatically improve health by reducing diarrhoeal disease deaths.

Safe and sufficient WASH plays a key role in preventing numerous neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as trachoma, soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis. However, poor WASH conditions still account for more than one million diarrhoeal deaths every year and constrain effective prevention and management of other diseases including malnutrition, NTDs and cholera.

Tuberculosis,https://www.who.int/health-topics/tuberculosis,"TB is caused by bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and it most often affects the lungs. TB is spread through the air when people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit. A person needs to inhale only a few germs to become infected. Every year, 10 million people fall ill with tuberculosis (TB). Despite being a preventable and curable disease, 1.5 million people die from TB each year – making it the world’s top infectious killer. TB is the leading cause of death of people with HIV and also a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance. Most of the people who fall ill with TB live in low- and middle-income countries, but TB is present all over the world. About half of all people with TB can be found in 8 countries: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines and
South Africa. About a quarter of the global population is estimated to have been infected with TB bacteria, but most people will not go on to develop TB disease and some will clear the infection. Those who are infected but not (yet) ill with the disease cannot transmit it. People infected with TB bacteria have a 5–10% lifetime risk of falling ill with TB. Those with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a higher risk of falling ill.         Common symptoms of TB disease include: • Prolonged cough • Chest pain • Weakness or fatigue • Weight loss • Fever • Night sweats Often, these symptoms will be mild for many months, thus leading to delays in seeking care and increasing the risk of spreading the infection to others. If the healthcare provider suspects a patient to have TB disease, they will send the patient for testing. In the case of suspected lung TB disease, patients will be asked to give a sputum sample for testing for TB bacteria. For non-lung TB disease, samples
of affected body fluids and tissue can be tested. WHO recommends rapid molecular diagnostic tests as initial tests for people showing signs and symptoms of TB. Other diagnostic tools can include sputum smear microscopy and chest X-rays. With TB infection, a person gets infected with TB bacteria that lie inactive in the body. This infection can develop into TB disease if their immune system weakens. People with TB infection do not show any signs or symptoms of TB. To identify TB infection,
healthcare providers will screen at-risk patients to rule out active TB, and they may use a skin or blood test to check for TB infection. TB disease is curable. It is treated by standard 6 month course of 4 antibiotics. Common drugs include rifampicin and isoniazid. In some cases the TB bacteria does not respond to the standard drugs. In this case, the patient has drug-resistant TB. Treatment
for drug-resistant TB is longer and more complex. The course of TB drugs is provided to the patient with information, supervision and support by a health worker or trained volunteer. Without such support, treatment adherence can be difficult. If the treatment is not properly completed, the disease can
become drug-resistant and can spread. In the case of TB infection (where the patient is infected with TB bacteria but not ill), TB preventive treatment can be given to stop the onset of disease. This treatment uses the same drugs for a shorter time. Recent treatment options have shortened
the duration to treatment to only 1 or 3 months, as compared to 6 months in the past.                                                                    ",WHO
Taeniasis and cysticercosis,https://www.who.int/health-topics/taeniasis-and-cysticercosis,"Infection with the tapeworm Taenia solium can result in two distinct conditions: taeniasis and cysticercosis . Taeniasis is the intestinal infection with the tapeworm and it occurs when a person eats raw or undercooked, infected pork. Taeniasis has no major impact on human health. However, tapeworm eggs pass in the faeces of the tapeworm carrier and in the absence of a proper sanitation may contaminate the environment. While tapeworm eggs are infective for pigs, T. solium eggs may also infect humans if they are ingested by a person (via the fecal-oral route, or by ingesting contaminated food or water). Ingestion of tapeworm eggs causes infection with the larval parasite in the tissues such as muscles, skin, eyes and the central nervous system (human cysticercosis), with possible devastating effects on health. When cysts develop in the brain, the condition is referred to as neurocysticercosis .         Taeniasis is usually characterized by mild and non-specific symptoms associated to an intestinal infection (abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, etc.). These symptoms may continue until the tapeworm dies following treatment, otherwise it may live for years. For cysticercosis , the incubation period is variable, and infected people may remain asymptomatic for years. In some endemic regions, infected people may develop visible or palpable nodules (a small solid bump or node which is solid that can be detected by touch) beneath the skin. Neurocysticercosis is associated with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the number, size, stage and location of the pathological changes as well as the host’s immune response and the parasite’s genotype, but it can also be clinically asymptomatic. Symptoms may include chronic headaches, blindness, seizures (epilepsy if they are recurrent), hydrocephalus, meningitis, dementia and symptoms caused by lesions occupying spaces of the central nervous system. The treatment of taeniasis by Taenia solium is important to prevent neurocysticercosis and as a tool to assist in controlling or stopping the parasite transmission cycle. The treatment can be done on an individual bases, or as Mass Drug Administration depending on the local circumstances and the control approaches being implemented. Taeniasis can be treated using anthelmintics (Praziquantel, Niclosamide, Albendazole). In neurocysticercosis , since the destruction of cysts may lead to an inflammatory response, specialised treatment of active disease is required and may include long courses with high doses of anthelmintic, as well as supporting therapy with corticosteroids and/or anti-epileptic drugs, and possibly surgery. The dosage and the duration of treatment can vary greatly and depend mainly on the number, size, location and developmental stage of the cysts, their surrounding inflammatory edema, acuteness and severity of clinical symptoms or signs.

Health Laws,https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-laws,"Law for Universal Health Coverage (UHC) For all aspects of health, there are binding rules that govern the rights and responsibilities of governments, health workers, companies, civil society and a country’s population. Together these rules make up the legal framework, or legal architecture for health. They take many forms including: statutory laws, regulatory and administrative laws, contracts, case law, and customary laws. Who is involved in making these rules, and the form they take, differs from country to country. Health laws are used to formalize commitment to goals, such as the goal of universal health coverage, creating a drive for action.  To enable cooperation and achieve health goals, people use law to create different organizations (such as hospitals) and relationships (such as contracts for providing health services). In turn, organizations (whether health ministries, the private sector or civil society) have mandates, policies and strategies based on legal rules that guide their work. There are also many rules that structure what health organizations and individuals should do, and what they may not do. This interaction between different health laws results in health system functions being carried out and health products and services being delivered.   Governments use health laws for: Establishing important health policy goals (including universal health coverage); Implementing health policy; Enabling the effective operation of key health system functions and regulating inputs (service provision, health workforce, medical products and technologies, financing, health information and governance); Creating the health systems architecture, establishing health organizations and networks, establishing mandates, duties and accountabilities; Managing and responding to risks to personal health and a country’s health security; Applying international health agreements and development goals at country level; Build strong foundations for good governance to enable meaningful participation by all types of individuals and health stakeholders, protect rights and define responsibilities, and Establish predictable, appropriate and fair rules for facilitating the operation of health markets and setting norms for responsible health behavior.               How does law create UHC? By providing legal recognition of access rights to essential health services, essential medicines and vaccines and by removing legal access barriers to universal access including discrimination. UHC can be defined as “the existence of a legal mandate for universal access to health services and evidence that the vast majority of the population has meaningful access to these services”. All countries that have achieved UHC have legislated to formalize the commitment UHC. By ensuring financial protection. UHC financing reforms aimed at providing financial protection, rely on legal mechanisms. Revenue raising, pooling, purchasing, and the definition of a countries benefit package all rely on law. By assuring health care quality. Six health care quality objectives are critical to efforts towards UHC: safety, equity, efficacy, patient centeredness, efficiency, timeliness, all rely on law for their achievement. Legal tools for UHC quality include: standard setting, licensing of health workers and products, accreditation of health services and facilities, clinical protocols, reporting systems, establishing monitoring and accountability mechanisms and processes, compliance monitoring, auditing and the use of sanctions.

Chikungunya,https://www.who.int/health-topics/chikungunya,"Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease that causes fever and severe joint pain. It is caused by a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus that belongs to the alphavirus genus of the family Togaviridae . The name “chikungunya” derives from a word in the Kimakonde language of southern Tanzania, meaning “to become contorted” and describes the stooped appearance of sufferers with joint pain (arthralgia). Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected female mosquitoes. Most commonly, the mosquitoes involved are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus . These two species can also transmit other mosquito-borne viruses, including dengue and Zika viruses. They bite throughout daylight hours, although there may be peaks of activity in the early morning and late afternoon. CHIKV was first identified in the United Republic of Tanzania in 1952 and subsequently in other countries in Africa and Asia. Urban outbreaks were first recorded in Asia in the 1970s, but since 2004, outbreaks of CHIKV have become more frequent and widespread. The first local, mosquito-transmitted chikungunya cases in the Americas were reported in late 2013, after which large outbreaks occurred affecting most of the countries in the region. Chikungunya has now been reported in 118 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.         Symptoms of chikungunya appear between 4 and 8 days after the patient has been bitten by the infected mosquito. Chikungunya is rarely fatal. Most symptoms are generally self-limiting and last for 2–3 days. The disease is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever, which is frequently accompanied by joint pain. Other common signs and symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. The joint pain is often debilitating and usually lasts for a few days to a few weeks. Most patients recover fully from the infection; however, occasional cases of eye, heart and neurological complications have been reported with CHIKV infections. Patients at extremes of the age spectrum are at higher risk for severe disease. Newborns infected during delivery and older people with underlying medical conditions may become severely ill and CHIKV infection can increase the risk of death. Often symptoms in infected individuals are mild and the infection may go unrecognized or be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue and other arboviruses also occur. There is no specific antiviral drug treatment for chikungunya. Treatment is directed primarily at relieving the symptoms, including joint pain. This is largely achieved by using anti-pyretic drugs to reduce fever, by optimizing the use of pain medication and by administering fluids. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not be administered until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Prevention and control rely heavily on reducing the number of water-filled habitats that allow mosquitoes to breed. During outbreaks, insecticides may be sprayed to kill flying mosquitoes; applied to surfaces in and around water-filled habitats where the mosquitoes land; and used to treat these habitats to kill the immature larvae. There is one vaccine approved in the United States of America and in Europe for use in travelers and laboratory workers; however, the vaccine is not widely available for public health use in endemic or outbreak settings. For protection in areas of chikungunya transmission, people with risk of exposure to infected mosquitoes are advised to wear clothing which minimizes skin exposure to day-biting mosquitoes. Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions. For those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children or sick or older people, insecticide-treated mosquito nets afford good protection. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce indoor biting.                                                                    ",WHO
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),https://www.who.int/health-topics/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers,"Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a virus transferred to humans from infected
dromedary camels. It is a zoonotic virus, meaning it is transmitted between
animals and people, and it is contractable through direct or indirect contact
with infected animals. MERS-CoV has been identified in dromedaries in several
countries in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. In total, 27 countries
have reported cases since 2012, leading to 858 known deaths due to the
infection and related complications. The origins of the
virus are not fully understood but according to the analysis of different virus
genomes it is believed that it may have originated in bats and later transmitted
to camels at some point in the distant past. Human-to-human
transmission is possible, but only a few such transmissions have been found
among family members living in the same household. In health care settings,
however, human-to-human transmission appears to be more frequent.         MERS-CoV infections
range from showing no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild respiratory symptoms to
severe acute respiratory disease and death. A typical
presentation of MERS-CoV disease is fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Pneumonia is a common finding, but not always present. Gastrointestinal
symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe illness can
cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in
an intensive care unit. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in older
people, people with weakened immune systems and those with chronic diseases
such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes. Approximately 35% of
patients with MERS-CoV have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true
mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS may be missed by existing surveillance
systems. The case fatality rates are currently counted only amongst the
laboratory-confirmed cases. Until more is
understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung
disease and immunocompromised persons are considered at high risk of severe
disease from MERS-CoV infection. These people should avoid contact with camels,
drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been
properly cooked. No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV specific vaccines and treatments are in development. Treatment is supportive and based on the patient’s clinical condition. As a general precaution, anyone visiting farms, markets, barns, or other places where dromedary camels and other animals are present should practice general hygiene measures, including regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding
    contact with sick animals. The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products, including milk and meat, carries a high risk of infection that can cause disease in humans. Animal products that are processed appropriately through cooking or pasteurization are safe for consumption
    but should also be handled with care to avoid cross contamination with uncooked foods. Camel meat and camel milk are nutritious products that can continue to be consumed after pasteurization, cooking or other heat treatments. Transmission of the virus has occurred in health care facilities in several countries, including transmission from patients to health care providers and transmission between patients before MERS-CoV was diagnosed. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS‐CoV
early or without testing because symptoms and other clinical features may be non‐specific.                                                                    ",WHO
Air pollution,https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution,"Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality. WHO data show that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants , with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures. Air quality is closely linked to the earth’s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the drivers of air pollution (i.e. combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Policies to reduce air pollution, therefore, offer a win-win strategy for both climate and health, lowering the burden of disease attributable to air pollution, as well as contributing to the near- and long-term mitigation of climate change.     From smog hanging over cities to smoke inside the home, air pollution poses a major threat to health and climate. Ambient (outdoor) air pollution in both cities and rural areas is causing fine particulate matter which result in strokes, heart diseases, lung cancer, acute and chronic respiratory diseases. Additionally, around 2.4 billion people are exposed to dangerous levels of household air pollution, while using polluting open fires or simple stoves for cooking fuelled by kerosene, biomass (wood, animal dung and crop waste) and coal. The combined effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution is associated with 7 million premature deaths annually. Sources of air pollution are multiple and context specific. The major outdoor pollution sources include residential energy for cooking and heating, vehicles, power generation, agriculture/waste incineration, and industry. Policies and investments that support sustainable land use, cleaner household energy and transport, energy-efficient housing, power generation, industry, and better municipal waste management can effectively reduce key sources of ambient air pollution.        WHO promotes interventions and initiatives for healthy sectoral policies (including energy, transport, housing, urban development and electrification of health-care facilities), addressing key risks to health from air pollution indoors and outdoors, and contributing to achieving health co-benefits from climate change mitigation policies. WHO provides technical support to WHO’s Member States in the development of normative guidance, tools and provision of authoritative advice on health issues related to air pollution and its sources. WHO monitors and reports on global trends and changes in health outcomes associated with actions taken to address air pollution at the national, regional and global levels. WHO has also developed and implemented a strategy for raising awareness on the risk of air pollution, as well as available solutions that can be implemented to mitigate the risks of exposure to air pollution. Through digital outreach and partnerships, WHO has helped enrich the value proposition of addressing air pollution for health and environment ministries, city governments and other stakeholders from sectors with significant emissions.

Foodborne trematode infections,https://www.who.int/health-topics/foodborne-trematode-infections,"Foodborne trematodes are a group of diseases that include the parasites Clonorchis, Opisthorchis, Fasciola and Paragonimus . These parasitic flukes have a complex life cycle involving diverse definitive hosts and one or two intermediate hosts. Foodborne trematodes cause infection in humans via the consumption of contaminated food (raw fish, crustaceans or vegetables). Infection can result in severe liver and lung disease and together these diseases are estimated to cause 2 million life years lost to disability and death worldwide every year.         The public health burden due to foodborne trematodiases is predominantly due to morbidity rather than mortality with early and light infections often going unnoticed. Chronic infections are associated with severe morbidity with symptoms reflecting the organ in which the adult worms are located in. Clonorchis and Opisthorchis species have adult flukes that lodge in the smaller bile ducts of the liver, resulting in inflammation and fibrosis of surrounding tissues. Acute or early infection may result in non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms. Chronic infection can result in cholangiocarcinoma, a fatal bile duct cancer. Both C. sinensis and O. viverrini are classified as carcinogens. Fasciola adult worms lodge in larger bile ducts and gall bladder resulting in inflammation, fibrosis, blockage, colic pain and jaundice. Chronic infection can result in liver cirrhosis. The final location of Paragonimus species is in the lung tissue, resulting in a chronic cough, blood-stained sputum, chest pain, dyspnoea (shortness of breath) and fever. These symptoms can be confounded with tuberculosis. Adult worms may also infect extra-pulmonary locations such as the brain and can result in symptoms of headaches, mental confusion, convulsions and cerebral haemorrhage. Treatment of foodborne trematodiases is important to prevent progression of clinical disease and reduce associated morbidity. Treatment can be offered through preventive chemotherapy or individual case management. Preventive chemotherapy involves a population-based approach where everyone in a given region or area is given medicines, irrespective of their infection status. This is recommended in areas where large numbers of people are infected. Praziquantel is recommended for treatment of clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis while triclabendazole is recommended for fascioliasis. Both praziquantel and triclabendazole can be used for treatment of paragonimiasis. Individual case-management involves the treatment of people with confirmed or suspected infection. This approach is more appropriate where cases are less clustered and where health facilities are available. Treatment should be complemented by interventions that reduce transmission such as education on safe food practices, improved sanitation and veterinary public health measures.

Zika virus disease,https://www.who.int/health-topics/zika-virus-disease,"Zika virus is primarily transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito
from the Aedes genus,
mainly Aedes aegypti ,
in tropical and subtropical regions. Aedes mosquitoes
usually bite during the day, peaking during early morning and late
afternoon/evening. This is the same mosquito that transmits dengue, chikungunya
and yellow fever. Zika virus is also transmitted from mother to fetus during
pregnancy, through sexual contact, transfusion of blood and blood products, and
organ transplantation. WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern regarding microcephaly, other neurological disorders and Zika virus from February to November 2016. Cases of Zika virus disease declined from 2017 onwards globally; however, Zika virus transmission persists at low levels in several countries in the Americas and in other endemic regions. To date, a total of 89 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito transmitted Zika virus infection, however surveillance remains limited globally. No vaccine is yet available for the prevention or treatment of
Zika virus infection. Development of a Zika vaccine remains an active area of
research The history of Zika virus                   The incubation period (the time from exposure to symptoms) of Zika virus disease is estimated to be 3 – 14 days. The majority of people infected with Zika virus do not develop symptoms. Symptoms are generally mild including fever, rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise, and headache, and usually last for 2 – 7 days. Complications of Zika virus disease Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities in the developing fetus and newborn. Zika infection in pregnancy also results in pregnancy complications such as fetal loss, stillbirth, and preterm birth. Zika virus infection is also a trigger of Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy and myelitis, particularly in adults and older children. Research is ongoing to investigate the effects of Zika virus infection on pregnancy outcomes, strategies for prevention and control, and effects of infection on other neurological disorders in children and adults. Protection against mosquito bites during the day and early evening is a key measure to prevent Zika virus infection. Special attention should be given to prevention of mosquito bites among pregnant women, women of reproductive age, and young children. Personal protection measures include wearing clothing (preferably light-coloured) that covers as much of the body as possible; using physical barriers such as window screens and closed doors and windows; and applying insect repellent to skin or clothing that contains DEET, IR3535 or icaridin according to the product label instructions. Young children and pregnant women should sleep under mosquito nets if sleeping during the day or early evening.  Travellers and those living in affected areas should take the same basic precautions described above to protect themselves from mosquito bites. Prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus Aedes mosquitoes breed in small collections of water around homes, schools, and work sites. It is important to eliminate these mosquito breeding sites, including: covering water storage containers, removing standing water in flower pots, and cleaning up trash and used tires. Community initiatives are essential to support local government and public health programs to reduce mosquito breeding sites.  Health authorities may also advise use of larvicides and insecticides to reduce mosquito populations and disease spread.

Rift Valley fever,https://www.who.int/health-topics/rift-valley-fever,"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. It is transmitted by mosquitoes and blood feeding flies. In humans, the disease ranges from a mild flu-like illness to severe haemorrhagic
    fever that can be lethal. When livestock are infected the disease can cause significant economic losses due to high mortality rates in young animals and waves of abortions in pregnant females. While some human infections have resulted from the bite of infected mosquitoes, most human infections result from contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians
    are at higher risk of infection. Humans may also become infected by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals. No human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented. The virus is a member of the Phlebovirus genus and was first identified in 1931 in a sheep epidemic on a farm in the Rift Valley of Kenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa. In 2000, the
    first reported cases of the disease outside the African continent came from Saudi Arabia and Yemen.         Mild form of Rift Valley Fever in humans The interval from infection to onset of symptoms for Rift Valley fever (RVF) varies from 2 to 6 days. In its mild form, people who are infected with the virus either experience no detectable symptoms at all or develop a mild form of the disease characterized
    by a feverish syndrome with sudden onset of flu-like fever, muscle pain, joint pain and headache. Some patients develop neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, loss of appetite and vomiting; in these patients the disease, in its early stages, may be
    mistaken for meningitis. The symptoms of RVF usually last from 4 to 7 days. Severe form of Rift Valley Fever in humans While most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of patients develop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually appears as one or more of three distinct syndromes: ocular (eye) disease (0.5-2% of patients), meningoencephalitis
    (less than 1%) or haemorrhagic fever (less than 1%). The total case fatality rate for RVF has varied widely between documented epidemics but, overall, has been less than 1%. Most fatalities occur in patients who develop the haemorrhagic icterus (jaundice) form of the disease. Diagnosis Because the symptoms of Rift Valley fever (RVF) are varied and non-specific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult, especially early in the course of the disease. RVF is difficult to distinguish from other viral haemorrhagic fevers as well as from many
    other diseases that cause fever, including malaria and typhoid fever. As such, definitive diagnosis requires laboratory testing. Treatment As most human cases of RVF are relatively mild and of short duration, patients with this form of the disease require no specific treatment. For the more severe cases, the predominant treatment is general supportive therapy. An inactivated vaccine has been developed for human use. However, it is not licensed or commercially available. It has been used experimentally to protect veterinary and laboratory personnel at high risk of exposure to RVF. Other candidate vaccines are
    under investigation. During an outbreak of RVF, close contact with animals and their body fluids has been identified as the most significant risk factor for RVF virus infection. Risk of animal-to-human transmission of infection can be reduced by avoiding unsafe animal husbandry
    and slaughtering practices by maintaining good hygiene, and avoiding unsafe consumption of fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue in affected regions.                                                                    ",WHO
Pneumonia,https://www.who.int/health-topics/pneumonia,"Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that is most commonly caused by viruses or bacteria. It can cause mild to life-threatening illness in people of all ages, however it is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. Pneumonia killed more than 808 000 children under the age of 5 in 2017, accounting for 15% of all deaths of children under 5 years.  People at-risk for pneumonia also include adults over the age of 65 and people with preexisting health problems. The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake. These infections are generally spread by direct contact with infected people. Vaccines can help prevent pneumonia.         Depending on the severity of the pneumonia, signs and symptoms may include: Cough Shortness of breath Fever, sweating and shaking chills Fatigue Chest pain Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Confusion, especially in older adults Pneumonia may be treated with antibiotics, if it is bacterial. The antibiotic of choice is amoxicillin dispersible tablets. Most cases of pneumonia require oral antibiotics, which are often prescribed at a health centre. These cases can also be diagnosed and treated with inexpensive oral antibiotics at the community level by trained community health workers. Hospitalization is recommended only for severe cases of pneumonia. Rest and plenty of hydration can also help people recover quicker. People of all ages can reduce their risk of pneumonia by: Get vaccinated: Immunization against Hib, pneumococcus, measles, influenza and whooping cough (pertussis) is the most effective way to prevent pneumonia. Wash your hands: Maintain good hygiene and washing your hands frequently, especially when caring for others who are sick or after blowing your nose, will keep germs from spreading. Address environmental factors: Reduce indoor air pollution by providing affordable clean indoor stoves and stop smoking. Maintain healthy lifestyle: Eat a healthy diet, rest and get regular exercise to help you stay well.

Suicide prevention,https://www.who.int/health-topics/suicide,"More than 720 000 people die by suicide every year. For each suicide, there are an estimated 20 suicide attempts. Suicide can occur at any stage of life and in all regions of the world. In 2021, suicide was the third leading cause of death among 15–29-year-olds globally, and 73% of all suicides happened in low- and middle-income countries. Almost 20% of global suicides were due to pesticide self-poisoning. While the link between suicide and mental health conditions (in particular, depression and alcohol use disorders) and a previous suicide attempt is well established in high-income countries, many suicides happen impulsively in moments of crisis. Further risk factors for suicide include experience of loss, loneliness, discrimination, relationship dispute, financial problems, chronic pain and illness, violence, abuse, and conflict or other humanitarian emergencies. Stigma around mental health conditions and suicide means many people thinking about suicide do not seek help. Suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect that impacts on families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies. Suicide: facts and figures globally Suicide worldwide in 2019 LIVE LIFE: an implementation guide for suicide prevention in countries             The urgency to act to prevent suicides has been recognized and prioritized at the highest levels. The reduction of suicide rates in countries is an indicator in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (the only indicator for mental health), WHO’s General Programme of Work and WHO’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030. The first WHO world suicide report, Preventing suicide: a global imperative , published in 2014, aimed to increase awareness of the public health significance of suicide and suicide attempts and make suicide prevention a public health priority. Governments are encouraged to join WHO’s LIVE LIFE initiative , implement WHO’s LIVE LIFE package of effective and evidence-based key interventions for suicide prevention, and develop or strengthen comprehensive national suicide prevention strategies in a multisectoral public health approach. National leadership and coordination on suicide prevention are further supported by the publication of National suicide prevention strategies: progress, examples and indicators . Recognizing that data and statistics are necessary for advocacy and decision-making, WHO published Suicide worldwide in 2019: Global Health Estimates . WHO’s vision is a world where death by suicide is no longer a leading cause of death and where people who are attempting or thinking about suicide feel comfortable seeking help which is provided capably and respectfully to all. Much can be done at individual, community and national levels to prevent suicide and suicide attempts. WHO’s LIVE LIFE approach recommends four effective, evidence-based key interventions which should be included in every national response to suicide: limit access to the means of suicide interact with the media for responsible reporting of suicide foster socio-emotional life skills in adolescents early identify, assess, manage and follow up anyone who is affected by suicidal behaviours. The foundational pillars of the interventions are situation analysis, multisectoral collaboration, awareness raising, capacity building, financing, surveillance, monitoring and evaluation. Suicide prevention efforts require coordination and collaboration among multiple sectors, including health, education, labour, agriculture, business, justice, law, defence, politics and the media. Suicide prevention is often not adequately addressed because of stigma and lack of awareness that suicide is a major public health problem. Communities also play a crucial role in preventing suicide.

Deafness and hearing loss,https://www.who.int/health-topics/hearing-loss,"A person is said to have hearing loss if they are not able to hear as well as someone with normal hearing, meaning hearing thresholds of 20 dB or better in both ears. It can be mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe or profound, and can affect one or both ears. Major causes of hearing loss include congenital or early onset childhood hearing loss, chronic middle ear infections, noise-induced hearing loss, age-related hearing loss, and ototoxic drugs that damage the inner ear. The impacts of hearing loss are broad and can be profound. They include a loss of the ability to communicate with others delayed language development in children, which can lead to social isolation, loneliness and frustration, particularly among older people with hearing loss. Many areas lack sufficient accommodations for hearing loss, which effect academic performance and options for employment. Children with hearing loss and deafness in developing countries rarely receive any schooling. WHO estimates that unaddressed hearing loss costs the global economy US$ 980 billion annually due to health sector costs (excluding the cost of hearing devices), costs of educational support, loss of productivity and societal costs.              WHO estimates that 50% of hearing loss can be prevented through public health measures. Some prevention strategies target individual lifestyle choices such as exposure to loud sounds and music or wearing protective equipment such as earplugs. This can be assisted through implementing audio standards for personal audio systems and devices. Further reductions in hearing loss can be gained through screening and early interventions in childhood, including application of assistive technologies or surgical options. Screenings can also prevent the use of damaging pharmaceuticals in high-risk cases. Hearing loss and deafness can also occur as a complication of other diseases such as measles, meningitis, rubella and mumps. Work to prevent these diseases through vaccination and hygiene programs can have a beneficial impact on rates of hearing loss and deafness. Immunizing adolescent girls and women of reproductive age against rubella before pregnancy, and preventing cytomegalovirus infections in pregnant women, can reduce the risk of babies born with congenital hearing loss or deafness.       Deafness and hearing loss are widespread and found in every
region and country. Currently
more than 1.5 billion people (nearly 20% of the global population) live with hearing
loss; 430 million of them have disabling hearing loss. It is expected that by
2050, there could be over 700 million people with disabling hearing loss. Globally, 34 million children have deafness or hearing loss, of
which 60% of cases are due to preventable causes. At the other end of the
lifespan, approximately 30% of people over 60 years of age have hearing loss. Many of the impacts of hearing loss can be mitigated through
early detection and interventions. These include specialized education programs
and sign language instruction for young children and their families. Assistive
technologies, including hearing aids, cochlear implants, closed captioning and
other devices can help people with hearing loss at any age. People may also
benefit from speech therapy, aural rehabilitation and other related services. Low- and middle-income countries bear a disproportionate burden
from hearing loss. WHO estimates that global hearing aid production covers just
3% of the need in these countries.                                                         ",WHO
Tick-borne encephalitis,https://www.who.int/health-topics/tick-borne-encephalitis,"Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is an important cause of viral infections of the central nervous system in eastern, central, northern and increasingly western European countries, and in northern China, Mongolia, and the Russian Federation. Tick-borne encephalitis virus is a member of the family Flaviviridae. Approximately 10 000–12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total number of clinical cases. The vast majority of infections with the virus result from infected ticks, which often remain firmly attached to the skin for days. On rare occasions, infection can result from consumption of unpasteurized milk from infect goats, sheep or cows. People come in contact with the ticks during outdoor activities in forested areas up to an altitude of about 2000 meters. There is no direct person-to-person transmission.         Most infections remain asymptomatic. In case of clinical illness, the incubation period for tick-borne encephalitis lasts 2–28 days (most commonly 7–14 days) and is followed by 1–8 days of general cold symptoms, such as fatigue, headache and general malaise, usually combined with fever of ≥38 °C. After an asymptomatic interval of 1–20 days up to 15% of patients experience a second phase of the disease characterized by fever frequently exceeding 40 °C and signs of central nervous system involvement, such as meningitis (e.g. fever, headache, and a stiff neck), encephalitis (e.g., drowsiness, confusion, and sensory disturbances), myelitis or radiculitis. Encephalitis developing during this second phase may result in paralysis, permanent sequelae or death. About 1% of cases with neurological pathologies may die; higher fatality rates have been reported from the Russian federation, which may be related to a different virus subtype. Severity of illness increases with age of the patient, but fatalities have been reported from all age groups. There is no specific treatment for tick-borne encephalitis.     People can protect themselves from ticks by wearing appropriate clothing, including long trousers and closed footwear, when hiking or camping in countries or areas at risk. The whole body should be inspected daily and attached ticks removed as soon as possible. The consumption of unpasteurized dairy products should also be avoided in those areas. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and effective. In areas where the disease is highly endemic, WHO recommends that vaccination be offered to all age groups, including children. Ticks also transmit Borreliosis (Lyme disease), which is a bacterial infection. TBE vaccination is not effective against this disease, which however is treatable with antimicrobials.                                                                ",WHO
Occupational health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/occupational-health,"Occupational health is an area of work in public health to promote and maintain highest degree of physical, mental and social well-being of workers in all occupations. Its objectives are: the maintenance and promotion of workers' health and working capacity; the improvement of working conditions and the working environment to become conducive to safety and health; the development of work organization and working cultures that should reflect essential value systems adopted by the undertaking concerned, and include effective managerial systems, personnel policy, principles for participation, and voluntary quality-related management practices to improve occupational safety and health. The science and practice of occupational health involves several disciplines, such as occupational medicine, nursing, ergonomics, psychology, hygiene, safety and other. The World Health Assembly urges countries to develop national policies and action plans and to build institutional capacities on occupational health, scale up the coverage with essential interventions for prevention and control of occupational and work-related diseases and injuries and occupational health services ensure in collaboration with other relevant national health programmes such as those dealing with communicable and non-communicable diseases, prevention of injuries, health promotion, mental health, environmental health, and health systems development.

Vaccines and immunization,https://www.who.int/health-topics/vaccines-and-immunization,"Immunization is a global health success story, saving millions of lives every year. Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body’s natural defenses to build protection. When you get a vaccine, your immune system responds. We now have vaccines to prevent more than 20 life-threatening diseases, helping people of all ages live longer, healthier lives. Immunization currently prevents 3.5 million to 5 million deaths every year from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza and measles. Immunization is key to primary health care, an indisputable human right, and one of the best health investments money can buy. Vaccines are also critical to the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks. They underpin global health security and are a vital tool in the battle against antimicrobial resistance. The COVID-19 pandemic strained health systems, resulting in dramatic setbacks.  The most recent data for diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DTP) immunization coverage underscores the need for ongoing catch-up, recovery and system-strengthening. Measles, because of its high transmissibility, acts as a “canary in the coalmine”, quickly exposing immunity. In 2023, the routine first dose of measles vaccine was missed by 22 million children – far from the 2019 level of 19.3 million children.     Vaccines train your immune system to create antibodies, just as it does when it’s exposed to a disease. However, because vaccines contain only killed or weakened forms of germs like viruses or bacteria, they do not cause the disease or put you at risk of its complications. Vaccines protect against many different diseases , including: cervical cancer cholera COVID-19 diphtheria hepatitis B influenza Japanese encephalitis malaria measles meningitis mumps pertussis pneumonia polio rabies rotavirus rubella tetanus typhoid varicella yellow fever Some other vaccines are currently being piloted, including those that protect against Ebola or malaria, but are not yet widely available globally. Not all these vaccinations may be needed in your country. Some may only be given prior to travel, in areas of risk, or to people in high-risk occupations. Talk to your healthcare worker to find out what vaccinations are needed for you and your family.        WHO is working with countries and partners to improve global vaccination coverage, including through these initiatives adopted by the World Health Assembly in August 2020. Immunization Agenda 2030 IA2030 sets an ambitious, overarching global vision and strategy for vaccines and immunization for the decade 2021–2030. It was co-created with thousands of contributions from countries and organizations around the world. It draws on lessons from the past decade and acknowledges continuing and new challenges posed by infectious diseases (e.g. Ebola, COVID-19). The strategy has been designed to respond to the interests of every country and intends to inspire and align the activities of community, national, regional and global stakeholders towards achieving a world where everyone, everywhere fully benefits from vaccines for good health and well-being. IA2030 is operationalized through regional and national strategies and a mechanism to ensure ownership and accountability and a monitoring and evaluation framework to guide country implementation.

Depression,https://www.who.int/health-topics/depression,"Depressive disorder, or depression, is a common mental health condition that can happen to anyone. It is characterized by a low mood or loss of pleasure or interest in activities for long periods of time. This is different from regular mood changes and feelings about everyday life. Depressive episodes last most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. People with depression may experience disturbed sleep and changes to their appetite. They may have feelings of low self-worth, thoughts about dying and hopelessness about the future. Tiredness and poor concentration are also common. Depression results from a complex interaction of social, psychological and biological factors. People who have lived through abuse, severe losses or other adverse events are more likely to develop depression. Problems at school and work can also result in depression. Prevention programmes have been shown to reduce depression. There are also effective psychological treatments and medications for depression. However, these are often absent or inaccessible, especially in low- and middle-income countries. It is estimated that more than 75% of people experiencing mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries receive no treatment.     In 2019, an estimated 280 million people, including 5% of all adults, experienced depression. Depression is more common among women than men. Worldwide, more than 10% of pregnant women and women who have just given birth experience depression. Depression can cause difficulties in all aspects of life, including performance at school, productivity at work, relationships with family, friends and community. Researchers estimate that 12 billion productive work days are lost every year to depression and anxiety alone, at a cost of nearly US$ 1 trillion. People with depression are at increased risk of suicide. Research also shows strong relationships between depression and physical health, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and respiratory diseases.        WHO works with Member States and partners to reduce the burden of mental health conditions, including depression. The Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030 highlights the steps required to provide appropriate interventions for people with mental health conditions, including depression. Depression and self-harm/suicide are among the priority conditions covered by WHO’s Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) . The programme aims to help countries increase services for people with depression and other disorders through care provided by non-specialist health workers in primary health care. WHO has developed brief psychological intervention manuals for depression that may be delivered by non-specialists to individuals and groups. Examples include Problem Management Plus , Group Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) for depression , and Thinking Healthy . WHO has also developed self-help tools that can be used by individuals (for example the online Step-by-Step programme ).                                                                 ",WHO
Influenza (seasonal),https://www.who.int/health-topics/influenza-seasonal,"Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses which circulate in all parts of the world. It represents a year-round disease burden. It causes illnesses that range in severity and sometimes lead to hospitalization and death. Most people recover from fever and other symptoms within a week without requiring medical attention. However, influenza can cause severe illness or death, particularly among high risk groups including the very young, the elderly, pregnant women, health workers and those with serious medical conditions. In temperate climates, seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter, while in tropical regions, influenza may occur throughout the year, causing outbreaks more irregularly.         Seasonal influenza is characterized by a sudden onset of fever, cough (usually dry), headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise (feeling unwell), sore throat and a runny nose. The cough can be severe and can last two or more weeks. For patients that are not in a high risk group, treatment focuses on relieving symptoms of influenza such as fever. Patients that are known to be in a group at high risk for developing severe or complicated illness should seek medical attention and should be treated with antiviral drug as soon as possible.

Commercial determinants of health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/commercial-determinants-of-health,"Commercial determinants of health (CDoH) are the private sector activities impacting public health, either positively or negatively, and the enabling political economic systems and norms. CDoH includes all products and services provided by private entities to gain a financial profit, as well as market strategies, working conditions, production externalities and political activities, such as misinformation, lobbying and donations. Some parts of the private sector also use instrumental, structural and discursive power to undermine public health policies that threaten profits. Commercial activities, especially by transnational corporations, affect non-communicable disease, infectious diseases and pandemics, injuries and climate change. These impacts also worsen inequities between and within countries. Profit shifting and the aggressive use of trade agreements by the unhealthy commodity industries are particularly detrimental to the global south. Simultaneously, the private sector is an indispensable partner for development by, for example, creating vaccines, medicines and assistive products, financing, building infrastructure and delivering health services towards Universal Health Coverage, or by ensuring food security. Member States should work to leverage these opportunities while protecting populations from harm. Communities, civil society organizations, governments at all levels, philanthropists and, where aligned, the private sector, must work together to achieve health for all. This requires addressing CDoH through conflict of interest, regulative, legal, economic, whole-of-government and geopolitical reforms.     The commercial determinants of health (CDoH) can negatively impact health, wellbeing, equity and health-systems. For example, half of all tobacco consumers will die from health issues related to these products, with annual deaths hitting 8 million. Many others are harmed by the actions of the alcohol, fast-food and sugar-sweetened beverage industries. Additionally, 20% of suicides are related to pesticide product self-poisoning. These especially affect disadvantaged population groups and low- and middle- income countries. CDoH also have health promoting and protective effects. Nearly 2 billion people will need assistive devices by 2050, greatly improving wellbeing. Installing and mandating the use of safety devices such as seatbelts, child restraints or helmets significantly reduces serious and fatal injuries. Pharmaceuticals and vaccines have significant effects, with the measles vaccines alone preventing 25.5 million deaths since 2000. There are also broader existential and societal impacts. Industry action drives climate change while also preventing meaningful action. Around 66% of all antimicrobials are used in agricultural practices, worsening antimicrobial resistance and creating further pandemic risks. Other evidence has shown exposure to long working hours was the key occupational risk, attributable to approximately 750 000 out of 1.9 million work-related deaths in 2016. Finally, privatization, deregulation and tax avoidance can worsen public services and increase inequities.                 WHO urges Member States to address the commercial determinants of health (CDoH) to improve health and health equity, thereby leveraging the benefits while protecting populations from harm. On a microlevel, this includes taxation, fiscal policies and meaningful government regulations on advertising, promotion and sponsorship of harmful products. Millions of lives have been saved thanks to the control policies under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and MPOWER. Member States should collaborate to address structural elements of CDoH, including the national and global political, economic, legal, financial and trade systems that enable and promote detrimental corporate practice. This broader agenda means repositioning social outcomes ahead of profit through alternative economic models and metrics, and reforming governance, including lobbying, donations and conflict of interest management. The private sector can promote health and well-being. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several entertainment companies joined WHO in partnerships to prevent the spread of the virus. Governments are also encouraged to ensure the equitable availability of those commercial products and services that promote or improve health and well-being. Civil society organizations can lead this action, enhancing transparency, accountability and harnessing citizen power to set progressive agendas. This can motivate government regulation and directly on the private sector to eliminate the harmful and enhance favourable impacts of their activities.

Sexual and reproductive health and rights,https://www.who.int/health-topics/sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-rights,"Sexual and reproductive health refers to a broad range of services that cover access to contraception, fertility and infertility care, maternal and perinatal health, prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), protection from sexual and gender-based violence, and education on safe and healthy relationships. Experiencing sexual and reproductive health means that a person has complete physical, mental and social well-being in all matters relating to their reproductive system and its functions. In everyday life, this means that people are able to have satisfying and safe sex lives, to have healthy pregnancies and births, and decide if, when and how often to have children. Access to sexual and reproductive health services is a human right and should be available to all people throughout their lives, as part of ensuring universal health coverage. This not only contributes to improved health outcomes, but also to gender equality and wider development.     Ensuring access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services upholds the dignity, rights and well-being of people worldwide. When people have control over their sexuality and reproduction, they can fully participate in social, economic and political spheres. Investing in a package of sexual and reproductive health services (including family planning, maternal and newborn care, and treatment for curable sexually transmitted infections) that fully meets the needs of all people has been shown to provide multiple health, social and economic benefits including significant decreases in unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions and maternal deaths. When sexual and reproductive health services are absent, there are serious negative impacts. Stopping evidence-supported and time-tested public health programmes destabilizes the health, economics and security of communities.        Advancing comprehensive sexual and reproductive health coverage requires political commitment and well-defined, coherent strategies for ensuring progress. In moving towards these aims, WHO recommends the following: Ensure that sexual and      reproductive health is integrated into national health policies and      plans. Review existing laws and      regulations that affect the provision of, and access to, related services;      when necessary, align these with human rights international laws and      commitments. Include comprehensive sexual      and reproductive health services within national health benefit packages,      following an approach that addresses people’s needs throughout their lives. Ensure that priority-setting      processes for health benefit packages are guided by principles of equity,      rights and gender equality. Promote the active participation and      leadership of women and girls at all levels. Ensure sufficient resources      for civil society actors and strengthen accountability. Invest in and strengthen      national governments’ capacity for improved measurement and tracking of      resource flows for sexual and reproductive health services. Strengthen the evidence-base      for advocacy and resource mobilization by developing investment cases on      the health, social and economic costs and benefits of investing in sexual      and reproductive health.

Food fortification,https://www.who.int/health-topics/food-fortification,"Fortification is the practice of deliberately increasing the content of one or more micronutrients (i.e., vitamins and minerals) in a food or condiment to improve the nutritional quality of the food supply and provide a public health benefit with minimal risk to health. As well as increasing the nutritional content of staple foods, the addition of micronutrients can help to restore the micronutrient content lost during processing. Fortification is an evidence-informed intervention that contributes to the prevention, reduction and control of micronutrient deficiencies. It can be used to correct a demonstrated micronutrient deficiency in the general population (mass or large-scale fortification) or in specific population groups (targeted fortification) such as children, pregnant women and the beneficiaries of social protection programmes. When the vitamins and minerals are not added to the foods during the processing but just before consumption at home or at schools or child‐care facilities, it is called point-of-use fortification. In addition to the micronutrient deficiencies, policies and implementation programmes for fortification need to consider an alignment with policies for the reduction of diet-related noncommunicable diseases. Such is the case of salt iodization, which builds on sodium consumption and, as result, needs to consider strategies for sodium intake reduction.             WHO has been working systematically in food fortification for decades and collaborates with different networks for fortification at regional, country and community levels. WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Codex Alimentarius Commission developed the general principles for the addition of essential nutrients to foods with the intention to provide guidance and protect health, while supporting implementation among Member States. WHO has organized and convened guideline development group meetings, technical consultations and working groups and has created implementation and monitoring tools in collaboration with country offices and external partners to help Member States to adapt and adopt WHO guidelines and technical documents on food fortification. WHO also monitors and reports progress of several nutrition targets that are affected by fortification such as the reduction of anaemia in women and the reduction of stunting in children under 5 years of age.    The World Health Organization recommends large scale food fortification as a powerful evidence-informed and cost-effective intervention to fight vitamin and mineral deficiencies, including iodine deficiency disorders, anaemia and iron deficiency, among
    others. Recommendations in all settings include: universal salt iodization fortification of maize flour, corn meal, wheat flour and rice with vitamins and minerals. For children living in different settings: micronutrient powders containing iron for point-of-use fortification of foods for infants and young children 6–23 months old or children 2–12 years. Mandatory food fortification occurs when governments legally oblige food producers to fortify particular foods or categories of foods with specified micronutrients, providing high certainty over time that they will contain a predetermined amount. Voluntary
    fortification occurs when a food manufacturer freely chooses to fortify particular foods in response to permission given in food law as a means to increase their brand value. Globally, mandatory regulations are most often applied to the fortification of food with micronutrients such as iodine, iron, vitamin A and folic acid. Of these, the iodization of salt is the most widely implemented globally.                                                             ",WHO
Research,https://www.who.int/health-topics/research,"Research is indispensable for resolving public health challenges – whether it be tackling diseases of poverty, responding to rise of chronic diseases,  or ensuring that mothers have access to safe delivery practices. Likewise, shared vulnerability to global threats, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola virus disease, Zika virus and avian influenza has mobilized global research efforts in support of enhancing capacity for preparedness and response. Research is strengthening surveillance, rapid diagnostics and development of vaccines and medicines. Public-private partnerships and other innovative mechanisms for research are concentrating on neglected diseases in order to stimulate the development of vaccines, drugs and diagnostics where market forces alone are insufficient. Research for health spans 5 generic areas of activity: measuring the magnitude and distribution of the health problem; understanding the diverse causes or the determinants of the problem, whether they are due to biological, behavioural, social or environmental factors; developing solutions or interventions that will help to prevent or mitigate the problem; implementing or delivering solutions through policies and programmes; and evaluating the impact of these solutions on the level and distribution of the problem.             High-quality research is essential to fulfilling WHO’s mandate for the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health. One of the Organization’s core functions is to set international norms, standards and guidelines, including setting international standards for research. Under the “WHO strategy on research for health”, the Organization works to identify research priorities, and promote and conduct research with the following 4 goals: Capacity - build capacity to strengthen health research systems within Member States. Priorities - support the setting of research priorities      that meet health needs particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Standards - develop an enabling environment for research      through the creation of norms and standards for good research practice.

Hepatitis,https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis,"Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that is caused by a
variety of infectious viruses  and noninfectious
agents leading to a range of health problems, some of which can be fatal. There
are five main strains of the hepatitis virus, referred to as types A, B, C, D
and E. While they all cause liver disease, they differ in important ways
including modes of transmission, severity of the illness, geographical
distribution and prevention methods. In particular, types B and C lead to
chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and together are the most
common cause of liver cirrhosis, liver cancer and viral hepatitis-related
deaths. An estimated 354 million people worldwide live with hepatitis B or C,
and for most, testing and treatment remain beyond reach. Some types of hepatitis are preventable through vaccination. A
WHO study found that an estimated 4.5 million premature deaths could be prevented
in low- and middle-income countries by 2030 through vaccination, diagnostic
tests, medicines and education campaigns. WHO’s global hepatitis strategy,
endorsed by all WHO Member States, aims to reduce new hepatitis infections by
90% and deaths by 65% between 2016 and 2030.         Many people with hepatitis A, B, C, D or E exhibit only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. Each form of the virus, however, can cause more severe symptoms. Symptoms of hepatitis A, B and C may include fever, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-coloured urine and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). In some cases, the virus can also cause a chronic liver infection that can later develop into cirrhosis (a scarring of the liver) or liver cancer. These patients are at risk of death. Hepatitis D (HDV) is only found in people already infected with hepatitis B (HBV); however, the dual infection of HBV and HDV can cause a more serious infection and poorer health outcomes, including accelerated progression to cirrhosis. Development of chronic hepatitis D is rare. Hepatitis E (HEV) begins with mild fever, reduced appetite, nausea and vomiting lasting for a few days. Some persons may also have abdominal pain, itching (without skin lesions), skin rash or joint pain. They may also exhibit jaundice, with dark urine and pale stools, and a slightly enlarged, tender liver (hepatomegaly), or occasionally acute liver failure. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent hepatitis B virus (HBV). This vaccine also prevents the development of hepatitis D virus (HDV) and given at birth strongly reduces transmission risk from mother to child. Chronic hepatitis B infection can be treated with antiviral agents. Treatment can slow the progression of cirrhosis, reduce incidence of liver cancer and improve long term survival. Only a proportion of people with chronic hepatitis B infection will require treatment. A vaccine also exists to prevent infections of hepatitis E (HEV), although it is not currently widely available. There are no specific treatments for HBV and HEV and hospitalization is not usually required. It is advised to avoid unnecessary medications due to the negative effect on liver function caused by these infections. Hepatitis C (HCV) can cause both acute and chronic infection. Some people recover on their own, while others develop a life-threatening infection or further complications, including cirrhosis or cancer. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. Antiviral medicines can cure more than 95% of persons with hepatitis C infection, thereby reducing the risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer, but access to diagnosis and treatment remains low. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is most common is low- and middle-income countries due to reduced access to clean and reliable water sources and the increased risk of contaminated food. A safe and effective vaccine is available to prevent hepatitis A. Most HAV infections are mild, with the majority of people recovering fully and developing immunity to further infection. However, these infections can also rarely be severe and life threatening due to the risk of liver failure.                                                                    ",WHO

Primary health care (PHC) is the most effective and cost-efficient way to get
there. Every country has a different path to achieving UHC and to decide what
to cover based on the needs of their populations and the resources at hand.
Investing in PHC ensures that all those needs are identified, prioritized and

including preparing for, responding to and recovering from emergencies.             As a foundation for UHC, WHO recommends reorienting health
    systems using a primary health care (PHC) approach. Achieving UHC is a WHO
    strategic priority, with the goal of 1 billion more people benefitting from
    universal health coverage by 2025. In countries with fragile health systems, we focus on technical
    assistance to build national institutions and service delivery to fill critical
    gaps in emergencies. In more robust health system settings, we drive public
    health impact towards health coverage for all through policy dialogue for the
    systems of the future and strategic support to improve performance. This work is supported by normative guidance and agreements;
    data, research and innovation; and leadership in the realms of diplomacy,
    advocacy, gender equality, health equity and human rights, multisectoral
    action, and finance.          WHO’s work is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDG) target 3.8, which focuses on achieving universal health coverage,
including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care
services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential
medicines and vaccines for all. Globally, progress towards universal health coverage is a
challenge. Progress in service coverage has stalled while the proportion of the
population facing catastrophic out-of-pocket health spending increases
continuously. WHO monitors progress and publishes global reports to reveal the
latest evidence every two years. See the reports here and visit the UHC

Health economics,https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-economics,"This area of work in WHO covers both technical and allocative efficiency: Costing and budget impact, global price tags and investment cases, cost-effectiveness analysis and health technology assessment, benefit package design and priority setting and resource allocation.  The following tools facilitate the above mentioned work: WHO-CHOICE and the One Health Tool for costing and cost-effectiveness analysis, Accesmod for geographic modelling and EPIC for estimating economic consequences of disease and injury.                        The following are the key areas of our work: Health technology assessment and Benefit Package Design - One of the key objectives for policymakers is to use existing and additional resources efficiently. This calls for prioritizing between and amongst interventions. There are several initiatives related to health technology assessment (HTA) and health benefit package design. These are: A survey on HTA and health benefit packages. The WHO-CHOICE (Choosing interventions that are Cost-Effective) project, with the Generalized Cost-Effectiveness Analysis methodology. The UHC Compendium. The OneHealth Tool, used to help countries to examine the costs and feasibility of their strategic plans, as well as to evaluate the plan’s impact. Costing and Technical Efficiency - The work on costing and technical efficiency explores questions around resource use in the health sector. Strategies for improving health and expanding access to health care services need to be examined from a resource perspective in order to ensure that they are feasible, efficient, affordable and sustainable. Health and the economy – While measurements of morbidity and mortality are key considerations for estimating the burden of disease in populations, they provide an incomplete picture of the adverse impact of ill health on human welfare. In particular, the economic consequences of poor health can be substantial. Analysis of the economic impact of ill-health addresses a number of policy questions concerning the consequences of disease or injury. Some of these questions relate to the microeconomic level of households, firms or government – such as the impact of ill-health on a household’s income or a firm’s profits – while others relate to the macroeconomic level, including the aggregate impact of a disease on a country’s current and future gross domestic product (GDP). WHO proposes a defined conceptual framework within which the economic impact of diseases and injuries can be considered and appropriately estimated. AccessMod – This is a toolbox that has been
developed by WHO in order to assist countries to examine the geographic aspects
of their health system. It specifically addresses the first three layers of a
well-known framework developed by Tanahashi (1978) to evaluate health service
coverage (the specific three layers being: the target population, availability
coverage and accessibility coverage). EPIC – It is a model to estimate the burden of ill-health (or, conversely
the contribution of improving health) on economic performance, through the
direct and indirect impacts that health has on two key production factors: the
labour force and physical capital. EPIC estimates how changes in health status
affect the size of the effective labour force and the accumulation of physical
capital and ultimately national income. EPIC may be used to conduct investment
case in health. One Health Tool - The OneHealth Tool is a software tool designed to inform
national strategic health planning in low- and middle-income countries. While
many costing tools take a narrow disease-specific approach, the OneHealth Tool
attempts to link strategic objectives and targets of disease control and
prevention programmes to the required investments in health systems. The tool
provides planners with a single framework for scenario analysis, costing,
health impact analysis, budgeting, and financing of strategies for all major
diseases and health system components. It is thus primarily intended to inform
sector wide national strategic health plans and policies. UHC Compendium - The UHC Compendium is a database of health services and intersectoral interventions designed to assist countries in making progress towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC). It provides a strategic way to organize and present information and creates a framework to think about health services and health interventions. The database for the Compendium spans the full spectrum of promotive, preventive, resuscitative, curative, rehabilitative, and palliative services, as well as a full complement of intersectoral interventions. The Compendium will provide rapid one-stop access to supporting evidence, associated human and material resource inputs, and feedback on cost impact as interventions are selected.

Congenital disorders,https://www.who.int/health-topics/congenital-anomalies,"Congenital disorders can be defined as structural or functional anomalies
that occur during intrauterine life. Also called birth defects, congenital anomalies
or congenital malformations, these conditions develop prenatally and may be
identified before or at birth, or later in life. An estimated 6% of babies
worldwide are born with a congenital disorder, resulting in hundreds of
thousands of associated deaths. However, the true number of cases may be much
higher because statistics do not often consider terminated pregnancies and
stillbirths. Some congenital disorders can be treated with surgical and non-surgical
options, such as cleft lip and palate, clubfoot and hernias. Others, including
heart defects, neural tube defects, and down syndrome, can cause lifelong
impacts. Congenital disorders are one of the main causes of the global burden of
disease, and low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected.
These areas are also less likely to have facilities to treat reversible conditions
such as clubfoot, leading to more pronounced and long-lasting effects.     Around the world each year, an estimated 295 000 newborns die before
reaching 4 weeks of age due to congenital disorders and associated
complications. Congenital anomalies can contribute to life-long disability and health
conditions. Over 50% of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost each year
due to congenital disorders could be prevented with prompt surgery or other treatment.
For example, 100 000 babies are born each year with clubfoot, which can be
easily corrected. Left untreated, however, this condition can cause severe and
permanent disability. Many congenital disorders result in social stigma and discrimination, which
can lead to embarrassment, isolation and other reductions in community
interaction. These conditions also have a high economic cost; long-term
disability creates significant impact on individuals, families, health care
systems and societies. These effects are amplified in low- and middle-income
countries where lack of accessibility and availability of support services may
make living with an impairment more difficult.                     Approximately 50% of
congenital disorders cannot be linked to a specific cause. However, known
causes include single gene defects, chromosomal disorders, multifactorial
inheritance, environmental teratogens and micronutrient deficiencies. Genetic
causes can be traced to inherited genes or from mutations. Consanguinity – when
parents are related by blood – increases the risk of congenital anomalies and
nearly doubles the risk of neonatal and early childhood death, intellectual
disability and other health conditions. Advanced maternal age also increases
the risk of chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome. Some diseases
are known to cause increases in rates of congenital disorders including Zika
virus, syphilis and rubella. Other anomalies, such as cystic fibrosis and
haemophilia C, are more prevalent in specific ethnic communities. The vast majority
(94%) of congenital disorders occur in low- and middle-income countries.
Possible causes include lack of screening and prenatal care, insufficient
access to nutritious foods for pregnant women, use or contact with alcohol or
tobacco, and increased exposure to infection or environmental
contaminants. Some congenital disorders
can be prevented through screening, vaccination, fortification of staple foods
with nutrients such as folic acid and iodine, and adequate antenatal care,
among other methods.                                                    ",WHO
Health technology assessment,https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-technology-assessment,"New interventions and technologies are constantly being developed and refined but their impacts on health, and implications for health systems, are not always clear. Health technology assessment (HTA) is a systematic and multidisciplinary evaluation of the properties of health technologies and interventions covering both their direct and indirect consequences. It is a multidisciplinary process that aims to determine the value of a health technology and to inform guidance on how these technologies can be used in health systems around the world. HTA is a transparent and accountable process that can be used by decision makers and other stakeholders to support the decision-making process in health care at the policy level by providing evidence about given technologies It has been described as a bridge that connects the world of research to that of policy making.     WHO’s efforts to broaden the use of HTA has resulted in more tools and resources being available for HTA globally. For example, the WHO-CHOICE tools have been used to show efficiencies in procurement in different regions of the world, and HTA methods have been applied to find cost-effective interventions to reduce road-traffic accidents in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. At the country level, WHO-CHOICE information was used in Ethiopia to determine the affordability and financial efficacy of universal health coverage. Understanding the importance of HTA in support of universal health coverage, resolution WHA67.23 was approved during the 67th World Health Assembly. The resolution recognizes the importance of evidence-based policy development and decision-making in health systems, and HTA’s role in sustainable and effective health systems. It also calls for the promotion of HTA within national frameworks, such as those for health system research, health professional education and the establishment of universal health coverage. As health technology assessment is a multidisciplinary approach that is applicable to all levels of a health system, WHO’s use of HTA is broad and integrated into several programs. For example, the HTA team conducts a global survey of HTA processes in WHO Member States and prepares guidance for its implementation in health systems. HTA is also used in broader evidence-informed health-related decision making, and in fair pricing guidelines for the procurement of health products. This work is conducted through both WHO’s global partnerships and programmes and through the WHO regional offices. The regional offices support the development of HTA capacity in their Member States though advocacy and raising awareness of the use of HTA in policy development, guidance for best practices and the coordination and collaboration between Member States and established partners.

Health workforce,https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-workforce,"Health systems can only function with health workers; improving health service coverage and realizing the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is dependent on their availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality. WHO estimates a projected shortfall of 11 million health workers by 2030, mostly in low- and lower-middle income countries. However, countries at all levels of socioeconomic development face, to varying degrees, difficulties in the education, employment, deployment, retention, and performance of their workforce. The chronic under-investment in education and
    training of health workers in some countries and the mismatch between education and employment strategies in relation to health systems and population needs are contributing to continuous shortages. These are compounded by difficulties in deploying
    health workers to rural, remote and underserved areas. Moreover, the increasing international migration of health workers may exacerbate health workforce shortfalls, particularly in low- and lower-middle income countries. Human resources for health
    information systems are often weak to take stock of selected health workers from the public sector. In some countries, challenges in universal access to health workers may also result from the lack of capacity by the public sector to absorb the supply of health workers due to budgetary constraints. As a result, some countries face the paradox of health
    worker unemployment co-existing with major unmet health needs. The High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth identified six pathways by which investments in the health and social workforce can spur inclusive economic growth. The health workforce has a vital role in building the resilience
    of communities and health systems to respond to disasters caused by natural or artificial hazards, as well as related environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks. Sixty-seven per cent (67%) of the health and social workforce are women and investing in the
    health workforce is an opportunity to create decent employment opportunities, in particular for women and youth.                           The Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030 is the key guiding document with principles and objectives presented below: Guiding principles Promote the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health. Provide integrated, people-centred health services devoid of stigma and discrimination. Foster empowered and engaged communities. Uphold the personal, employment and professional rights of all health workers, including safe and decent working environments and freedom from all kinds of discrimination, coercion and violence. Eliminate gender-based violence, discrimination and harassment. Promote international collaboration and solidarity in alignment with national priorities. Ensure ethical recruitment practices in conformity with the provisions of the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel. Mobilize and sustain political and financial commitment and foster inclusiveness and collaboration across sectors and constituencies. Promote innovation and the use of evidence. Working for Health Programme The Working for Health Programme is a joint partnership between the World Health Organization (WHO), International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to expand and transform the health and social workforce to drive inclusive economic growth and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Working for Health contributes to universal health coverage and to SDG 3, 4, 5 and 8 (health, education, gender equality, decent work and economic growth) through the Five-Year Action Plan on Health Employment and Inclusive Economic Growth 2017-2021 .  In 2020, Working for Health supported thirty-two countries and two regional economic areas namely, the Southern African Development Community and the West African Economic and Monetary Union.

Oral health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/oral-health,"Oral health is the state of the mouth, teeth and orofacial structures that enables individuals to perform essential functions such as eating, breathing and speaking, and encompasses psychosocial dimensions such as self-confidence, well-being and the ability to socialize and work without pain, discomfort and embarrassment. Oral health varies over the life course from early life to old age, is integral to general health and supports individuals in participating in society and achieving their potential. Oral diseases encompass a range of diseases and conditions that include dental caries, periodontal (gum) disease, tooth loss, oral cancer, oro-dental trauma, noma and birth defects such as cleft lip and palate. Oral diseases are among the most common noncommunicable diseases worldwide, affecting an estimated 3.5 billion people. While the global burden of oral health conditions is growing, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, the overall burden of oral health conditions on services is likely to keep increasing because of population growth and ageing. Oral diseases disproportionately affect the most vulnerable and disadvantaged populations. People of low socioeconomic status carry a higher burden of oral diseases and this association remains across the life course, from early childhood to older age, and regardless of the country's overall income level.             The WHO Oral Health Programme leads the work on setting the global 
oral health policy agenda in close collaboration with member states and 
other key stakeholders. Recent momentum has led to the development of 
key policy documents to support countries in moving towards universal 
health coverage for oral health by 2030. These include the Global strategy on oral health , the Global oral health action plan and the Global oral health status report . To support implementation of this ambitious policy agenda, the WHO Oral Health Programme supports countries by: providing leadership and technical support to countries on oral health policy design and implementation; monitoring disease burden, risk factors, health service use and other health trends related to oral health; and reviewing current and emerging evidence including cost-effective analyses of oral health interventions to support the establishment of norms and standards. The WHO Oral Health Programme contributes to other priority activities in countries such as: supporting the phase down in the use of dental amalgam in the context of the Minamata Convention on mercury; strengthening the oral health care system with a focus on integrating essential oral health care into primary health care and UHC benefit package; supporting the implementation of public health interventions based on digital technologies; and reinforcing integration of oral health into life-course programmes including the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing.                Most oral diseases and conditions share modifiable risk factors with the leading noncommunicable diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and mental disorders). These risk factors include tobacco use, alcohol consumption and unhealthy diets high in free sugars, all of which are increasing at the global level. There is a proven relationship between oral and general health. It is reported, for example, that diabetes is linked with the development and progression of periodontitis. Moreover, there is a causal link between high consumption of sugars and diabetes, obesity and dental caries. When oral health is compromised by disease or injury, general health is also affected. The pain and discomfort associated with oral diseases make concentrating difficult, cause people to miss school or work, and can lead to social isolation. Oral diseases have a severe social and economic impact on individuals and families by increasing household expenditures and seriously affecting people’s quality of life and well-being.

Abortion,https://www.who.int/health-topics/abortion,"WHO defines health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Making health for all a reality, and moving towards the progressive realization of human rights, requires that all individuals have access to quality health care, including comprehensive abortion care services – which includes information, management of abortion, and post-abortion care. Lack of access to safe, timely, affordable and respectful abortion care poses a risk to not only the physical, but also the mental and social, well-being of women and girls. Induced abortion is a simple and common health-care procedure. Each year, almost half of all pregnancies – 121 million – are unintended; 6 out of 10 unintended pregnancies and 3 out of 10 of all pregnancies end in induced abortion. Abortion is safe when carried out using a method recommended by WHO, appropriate to the pregnancy duration and by someone with the necessary skills. However, when women with unwanted pregnancies face barriers to obtaining quality abortion, they often resort to unsafe abortion. Ensuring that women and girls have access to abortion care that is evidence-based – which includes being safe, respectful and non-discriminatory – is fundamental to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) relating to good health and well-being (SDG3) and gender equality (SDG5).     Restricting access to abortion does not reduce the number of abortions; however, it dramatically affects whether abortions attained are safe. Nearly half of all abortions are unsafe. Unsafe abortions
contribute to preventable maternal mortality and morbidity. Each year an
estimated 7 million women in developing countries are treated in hospital
facilities for complications from unsafe abortion. Barriers to safe, timely, geographically reachable, affordable, respectful and non-discriminatory abortion care can cause emotional distress and violate women’s and girls’ right to privacy; right to equality and non-discrimination; and right to be free from torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment. It also has financial and social implications for people and communities including negatively impacting women’s and girls’ possibilities to obtain education and full and effective participation in society. Abortion regulations that force people to travel to attain legal care, or that require mandatory counselling or waiting periods, burden health systems and can result in women experiencing travel costs, loss of income or the need to resort to unsafe abortion. A disproportionate share of resources is used for post-abortion care: in developing countries, treatments of complications of unsafe abortion cost health systems US$ 553 million per year, while households experience US$ 922 million in income loss due to disabilities.                         Abortion can be safely and effectively performed in a range of settings and by a variety of people, including different types of health workers, and in early pregnancy by the woman herself. Person-centred, equitable and accessible abortion care supports efficient use of resources and enables women to attain care in line with their values, preferences and circumstances. This is supported by well functioning health systems; availability and accessibility of information; and respect for human rights within a supportive framework of law and policy. Ensuring that safe and dignified abortion care is attainable in practice by all who need it implies, among other things, that enough health workers, of different types, provide abortion care within reach; access to abortion care is enabled through a variety of delivery approaches, including self-management of abortion; abortion care does not cause financial hardship to women; laws and policies that cause barriers to quality abortion care (including criminalization of abortion, mandatory waiting periods and third-party authorization requirements) are removed; health workers are trained to provide safe and respectful care, and to interpret laws and policies in a human rights-compliant way; access to abortion is not negatively impacted by health workers refusing to provide care based on personal beliefs; and people have access to accurate and non-biased information to prevent unintended pregnancies and make autonomous decisions about abortion.

Radon,https://www.who.int/health-topics/radon,"Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas. It has no smell, colour or taste, and is produced from the natural radioactive decay of uranium in rocks and soil. Radon can also be found in water. Radon gas escapes easily from the ground into the air. Outdoors, radon quickly dilutes to very low concentrations and is generally not a problem. However, it tends to concentrate in enclosed spaces, such as underground mines, houses, and other buildings. Soil gas infiltration is recognized as the most important source of residential radon. Other sources of radon include building materials and water extracted from wells, but are of less importance. Radon decays and produces further radioactive particles. As we breathe, the particles are deposited on the cells lining the airways, where they can damage DNA and potentially cause lung cancer. Radon causes between 3–14% of all lung cancers, depending on the average radon level and the smoking prevalence in a country. Radon is much more likely to cause lung cancer in people who smoke: smokers are 25 times more at risk from radon than non-smokers.      WHO works with international partners to increase understanding of the effects of radon exposure on health and to promote sound policy options for preventing and mitigating radon exposure. WHO supports the development of national radon programmes and activities related to radon policies, radon mitigation and prevention as well as radon risk communication.        For most people, the greatest exposure to radon occurs in the home. The concentration of radon in a home depends on the amount of uranium in the underlying rocks and soils, the construction of the house and the ventilation habits of the inhabitants. Radon levels can be measured in an inexpensive and simple manner. Well-tested, durable and cost-efficient methods exist for preventing radon in new houses and reducing radon in existing dwellings. Radon prevention should be considered when new houses are built, particularly in radon prone areas. Radon levels in existing homes can be reduced by, for example, improving the ventilation of the house and sealing floors and walls. In many countries, drinking water is obtained from groundwater sources such as springs and wells. Radon dissolved in drinking-water can be released into indoor air. Normally, a higher radon dose is received from inhaling radon compared with ingestion. Straightforward and effective techniques exist to reduce the concentration of radon in drinking-water supplies by aeration or using special filters.

Refugee and migrant health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/refugee-and-migrant-health,"Today there are some 1 billion migrants globally, about 1 in 8 of the global population. These include 281 million international migrants and 82.4 million forcibly displaced (48 million internally displaced, 26.4 million refugees, 4.1 million asylum seekers) (1) . UNHCR estimates there are many millions of stateless people globally. The experience of migration is a key determinant of health and well-being. Refugees and migrants remain among the most vulnerable members of society faced often with xenophobia; discrimination; poor living, housing, and working conditions; and inadequate access to health services, despite frequently occurring physical and mental health problems. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed additional challenges both in terms of increased risk of infection and death experienced by refugees and migrants and has highlighted existing inequities in access to and utilization of health services. Refugees and migrants have also suffered the negative economic impact of lockdown and travel restrictions. Refugees and migrants need to be in good health to protect both themselves and host populations. They have the human right to health, and countries have an obligation to provide refugee and migrant sensitive health care services. In 2020 WHO established the Health and Migration Programme (PHM) to provide global leadership in health and migration issues in the context of WHO’s own Global action plan: promoting the health of refugees and migrants 2019–23. [1] https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/     Refugees and migrants often come from communities affected by war, conflict or economic crisis, with vulnerabilities related to the condition of their journeys such as inadequate access to food and water, sanitation and other basic services. They are at risk of communicable diseases, accidental injuries, hypothermia, burns, unwanted pregnancy and delivery-related complications, and various noncommunicable diseases. Moreover, refugees and migrants are at risk of poor mental health outcomes. Refugee and migrant health are also strongly related to the social determinants of health in host communities (e.g., employment, income, education and housing). To promote public health protection for them and the host populations, refugees and migrants should have equitable access to quality health services, free of discrimination, exclusion and stigma. In addition, appropriate multisectoral public policy responses are required to address the social determinants. Refugees and migrants also play a key employment role in the provision of health and social services, and access to health services for the populations recognizes this contribution and contributes to social well-being and cohesion. The WHO Health and Migration Programme (PHM) works with countries to promote the human right to health and access to quality and culturally appropriate health services, with adequate social and financial protection.        The WHO Global action plan: promoting the health or refugees and migrants (GAP) was agreed by the World Health Assembly in 
2019. The GAP is part of an international framework established by the 
United Nations to manage global migration positively, including the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and two global compacts, the 
Global Compact on Refugees (GCR) and the Global Compact for Safe, 
Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM). The WHO Global action plan has six key priorities: promote the health of refugees and migrants through a mix of short-term and long-term public health interventions; promote continuity and quality of essential health care, while developing, reinforcing and implementing occupational health and safety measures; advocate the mainstreaming of refugee and migrant health into global, regional and country agendas and the promotion of refugee-sensitive and migrant-sensitive health policies and legal and social protection; the health and well-being of refugee and migrant women, children and adolescents; gender equality and empowerment of refugee and migrant women and girls; and partnerships and intersectoral, intercountry and interagency coordination and collaboration mechanisms; enhance capacity to tackle the social determinants of health and to accelerate progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, including universal health coverage; strengthen health monitoring and health information systems; and support measures to improve evidence-based health communication and to counter misconceptions about migrant and refugee health.

Maternal health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/maternal-health,"Maternal health refers to the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. Each stage should be a positive experience, ensuring women and their babies reach their full potential for health and well-being. Although important progress has been made in the last two decades, about 287 000 women died during and following pregnancy and childbirth in 2020. This number is unacceptably high. The most common direct causes of maternal injury and death are excessive blood loss, infection, high blood pressure, unsafe abortion, and obstructed labour, as well as indirect causes such as anemia, malaria, and heart disease. Most maternal deaths are preventable with timely management by a skilled health professional working in a supportive environment. Ending preventable maternal death must remain at the top of the global agenda. At the same time, simply surviving pregnancy and childbirth can never be the marker of successful maternal health care. It is critical to expand efforts reducing maternal injury and disability to promote health and well-being. Every pregnancy and birth is unique. Addressing inequalities that affect health outcomes, especially sexual and reproductive health and rights and gender, is fundamental to ensuring all women have access to respectful and high-quality maternity care.     About 140 million births take place every year and the proportion attended by skilled health personnel has increased: from 58% in 1990 to 81% in 2019. This is mostly due to larger numbers of births taking place at a health facility. Deaths from complications during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period have declined by 38% in the last two decades, but at an average reduction of just under 3% per year, this pace of progress is far too slow. It also hides vast inequalities within and across countries. More than half of maternal deaths occur in fragile and humanitarian settings. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia share the greatest burden of maternal deaths, 86% of the global total in 2017. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offers an opportunity for the international community to work together and accelerate progress to improve maternal health for all women, in all countries, under all circumstances. SDG targets for maternal health include 3.1, aiming for an average global ratio of less than 70 deaths per 100 000 births by 2030, and 3.8, calling for the achievement of universal health coverage. These cannot be achieved without reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health coverage for all. Improving maternal health is one of WHO’s key priorities, grounded in a human rights approach and linked to efforts on universal health coverage. WHO advocates for health planning where women’s values and preferences are at the centre of their own care. Meaningful engagement and empowerment of women, families, communities, and providers is essential for quality improvement initiatives. Promoting health along the whole continuum of pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal care is also crucial. This includes good nutrition, detecting and preventing diseases, ensuring access to sexual and reproductive health and supporting women who may be experiencing intimate partner violence. It is WHO’s responsibility to monitor progress towards the global goal for reducing maternal death (SDG target 3.1). WHO generates data, research, clinical guidelines and programmatic tools to support achievement of global targets and evidence-based strategies for ending preventable maternal mortality (EPMM) and improving maternal health and well-being. WHO supports Member States as they implement plans to promote access to quality health services for all. Strong partnerships are crucial, such as The Network for Improving Quality of Care for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, launched by WHO and UNICEF.

Lassa fever,https://www.who.int/health-topics/lassa-fever,"Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus, a member of the arenavirus family of viruses. Humans usually become infected with Lassa virus through exposure to food or household items contaminated with urine or faeces of infected Mastomys rats. The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of West Africa. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Togo and Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur, particularly in health care settings in the absence of adequate infection prevention and control measures. Diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential. The overall case-fatality rate is 1%. Among patients who are hospitalized with severe clinical presentation of Lassa fever, case-fatality is estimated at around 15%. Early supportive care with rehydration
    and symptomatic treatment improves survival. About 80% of people who become infected with Lassa virus have no symptoms. 1 in 5 infections result in severe disease, where the virus affects several organs such as the liver, spleen and kidneys.         The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 2–21 days. The onset, when it is symptomatic, is usually gradual, starting with fever, general weakness and malaise. After a few days, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
    diarrhoea, cough, and abdominal pain may follow. In severe cases facial swelling, fluid in the lung cavity, bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina or gastrointestinal tract and low blood pressure may develop. Protein may be noted in the urine. Shock, seizures, tremor, disorientation and coma may be seen in the later stages. Deafness occurs in 25% of recovered patients. In half of these cases, hearing returns partially after 1–3 months. Transient hair
    loss and gait disturbance may occur during recovery. Death usually occurs within 14 days in fatal cases. The disease is severe late in pregnancy, with maternal death and/or foetal loss in more than 80% of cases during the third trimester. Because the symptoms of Lassa fever are so varied and non-specific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult, especially early in the course of the disease. Lassa fever is difficult to distinguish from other viral haemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola virus
    disease, malaria, shigellosis, typhoid fever and yellow fever. There is currently no licensed vaccine for Lassa fever, but several potential vaccines are in development. Despite not being licensed as a treatment for Lassa fever the antiviral drug ribavirin has been used in several countries as a therapeutic agent.
    However, there is still a need for a safe treatment with proven efficacy, and a range of potential treatments including immune therapies and drug therapies are currently being evaluated. No evidence supports the role of ribavirin as a treatment for
    Lassa fever. Prevention of Lassa fever relies on promoting good “community hygiene” to discourage rodents from entering homes. Effective measures include storing foodstuffs in rodent-proof containers, disposing of garbage far from the home, maintaining
    clean households and keeping cats. Because Mastomys rats are so abundant in endemic areas, it is not possible to eliminate them from the environment. Family members should always be careful to avoid contact with blood and body fluids while caring
    for sick persons. Lassa fever is known to be endemic. Health-care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing. Health care staff should apply standard infection
    prevention and control precautions.                                                                    ",WHO
Disability,https://www.who.int/health-topics/disability,"Disability is part of being human. An estimated 1.3 billion people – about 16% of the global population – currently experience significant disability. This number is increasing due in part to population ageing and an increase in the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases. Disability results from the interaction between individuals with a health condition, such as cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and depression, with personal and environmental factors including negative attitudes, inaccessible transportation and public buildings, and limited social support. A person’s environment has a huge effect on the experience and extent of disability. Inaccessible environments create barriers that often hinder the full and effective participation of persons with disabilities in society on an equal basis with others. Progress on improving social participation can be made by addressing these barriers and facilitating persons with disabilities in their day to day lives. For more information, see the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) .             WHO works to fully integrate and promote disability inclusion in the health sector. It works to ensure persons with disabilities: have equitable access to effective health services; are included in health emergencies preparedness and responses; and can access cross-sectorial public health interventions to achieve the highest      attainable standard of health. As requested in the World Assembly Resolution 74.8, WHO will launch the Global Report on Health Equity for Persons with Disabilities on 2 December 2022, which provides Member States and development partners with updated evidence, analysis and recommendations on disability inclusion in the health sector. Also requested in the resolution, WHO is developing technical guidance to support Member States to take action to realize the highest attainable standard of health for persons with disabilities.  This guidance will be in the form of a national strategic planning toolkit, the Disability Inclusion in the Health Sector Guide for Action.  It will provide practical guidance on how to develop a comprehensive plan to advance health equity for persons with disabilities through integration into health systems governance and planning. WHO strives to be an inclusive organization, providing an enabling environment in which persons with disabilities fully and effectively participate on an equal basis with others, and that disability is systematically integrated in all work of the Organization, as it advances its mission to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the most vulnerable. In December 2020, WHO has launched its policy on disability and an action plan for its implementation. These documents serve as the agenda for implementing the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy across WHO, which will ensure disability inclusion is consistently and systematically integrated into all aspects of WHO’s operational and programmatic work.                  An estimated 1.3 billion people – or 1 in 6 people worldwide – experience significant disability. Persons with disabilities die earlier, have poorer health, and experience more limitations in everyday functioning than the rest of the population due to health inequities. These health inequities arise from unfair conditions that affect persons
    with disabilities disproportionally, including stigma, discrimination, poverty, exclusion from education and employment, and barriers faced in the health system itself. Compared to persons without disabilities, some persons with disabilities: die up to 20 years earlier; have more than a double risk of developing comorbid conditions such as depression, asthma, diabetes, stroke, obesity or poor oral health; find inaccessible health facilities up to 6 times more hindering; and, are up to 15 times more limited by inaccessible and unaffordable transportation. It is a state obligation, through the health sector in coordination with other sectors, to address existing health inequities so that persons with disabilities can enjoy their inherent right to the highest attainable standard of health. Disability inclusion is critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and global health priorities of universal health coverage, protection in health emergencies and healthier populations. Acting to achieve health equity for persons with disabilities is acting to achieve Health for All.                                               ",WHO
Quality of care,https://www.who.int/health-topics/quality-of-care,"Quality of care is the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes.  It is based on evidence-based professional knowledge and is critical for achieving universal health coverage.
As countries commit to achieving Health for All, it is imperative to carefully consider the quality of care and health services.  Quality health care can be defined in many ways but there is growing acknowledgement that quality health services
should be: Effective – providing evidence-based healthcare services to those who need them; Safe – avoiding harm to people for whom the care is intended; and People-centred – providing care that responds to individual preferences, needs and values. To realize the benefits of quality health care, health services must be: Timely – reducing waiting times and sometimes harmful delays; Equitable – providing care that does not vary in quality on account of gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socio-economic status; Integrated – providing care that makes available the full range of health services throughout the life course; Efficient – maximizing the benefit of available resources and avoiding waste.   The Sustainable Development Goals urge countries to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC), including financial risk protection and access to quality essential health care services. However, the reality in many settings is that providing quality care remains a significant challenge, and inadequate quality results in avoidable mortality, human suffering and significant economic losses. While challenges to improving the quality of care are substantial, the need for action is clear, and many countries are making progress to build quality into their health systems. The WHO-World Bank-OECD report –  Delivering quality health services – highlights the need for action across multiple stakeholders at all health system levels. The provision of quality services requires good governance; a skilled and competent health workforce that is supported and motivated; financing mechanisms that enable and encourage quality care; information systems that continuously monitor and learn to drive better care; medicines, devices and technologies that are available, safe and appropriately regulated; and accessible and well-equipped healthcare facilities. WHO, World Bank and the OECD have proposed a series of actions from key constituencies – governments, health systems, citizens and patients, and health workers – that need to work together to achieve the goal of quality health service delivery at the front line.                             UHC cannot be achieved      without attention to quality of care in all settings including those experiencing fragility, conflict      and vulnerability. Quality health services      should be: effective; safe; people-centred; timely; equitable; integrated;      and efficient. Improving the quality of      health services requires strong national direction from governments,      focused sub-national support, and action at the health facility level.      Across all levels there is a need for engagement and empowerment of the      communities served by the health system. National policies and      strategies aimed at improving quality of care provide a strong foundation      for improving quality across the health system and need to be closely      aligned with broader national health policy and planning. Quality needs to be      continually measured and monitored to drive improvement, which relies on      accurate, timely and actionable data. Improving the quality of      health services requires attention to knowledge generation and learning.      Lessons on delivery of quality care should be systematically captured,      documented and shared within and between countries. Major public health      crises – such as outbreaks of highly infectious diseases – are a priority      for countries. For health systems to be resilient, they require quality      health services that are delivered prior to, maintained during, and      improved upon following a public health emergency.

Yellow fever,https://www.who.int/health-topics/yellow-fever,"Yellow fever is a viral disease that is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected mosquitoes. It is prone to epidemics and is preventable with a vaccine. These day-biting mosquitoes breed around houses (domestic), in forests or jungles (wild), or in both habitats (semi-domestic). Yellow fever is a high-impact, high-threat disease, with a risk of international spread, representing a potential threat to global health security. There are 3 types of transmission cycles: Sylvatic (or jungle) yellow fever spreads when monkeys are bitten by wild mosquitoes that pass the virus on to other monkeys and humans. Intermediate yellow fever spreads when semi-domestic mosquitoes infect both monkeys and people. This is the most common type of outbreak in Africa. Urban yellow fever can cause large epidemics when infected people introduce the virus into heavily populated areas with high mosquito density and where people have little immunity. Occasionally, infected travellers have exported cases to countries that are free of yellow fever. However, the disease can only spread easily to a new country if there are mosquito species able to transmit it, specific climatic conditions, and the animal reservoir needed to maintain it.         Yellow fever can present with a wide range of symptoms and severity. Once contracted, the yellow fever virus incubates in the body for 3–6 days. Many people do not experience symptoms, but when these do occur, the most common are fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. In most cases, symptoms disappear after 3–4 days. A small percentage of patients enter a second, more toxic phase within 24 hours of recovering from initial symptoms. High fever returns and several body systems are affected, usually the liver and kidneys. In this phase, people are likely to develop jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes, hence the name yellow fever), dark urine, and abdominal pain with vomiting. Bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes, or stomach. Half of these patients die within 7–10 days. Yellow fever is difficult to diagnose, especially during the early stages. More severe cases can be confused with severe malaria, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis (especially fulminant forms), other haemorrhagic fevers, infection with other flaviviruses (such as dengue haemorrhagic fever) and poisoning. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing in blood and urine can sometimes detect the virus in early stages of the disease. In later stages, testing to identify antibodies is needed (IgM). Yellow fever infections can cause serious illness and can be fatal in severe cases. Early supportive treatment in hospitals improves survival rates. There is currently no specific anti-viral drug for yellow fever, but specific care to treat dehydration, fever, and liver and kidney failure improves outcomes. Associated bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics. Patients need to stay under mosquito nets during the day to limit the risk of spreading to others through mosquito bites. Vaccination is the single most important measure for preventing yellow fever. The prevention of outbreaks can only be achieved if the majority of the population is immunized. The yellow fever vaccine is safe and affordable, and a single dose provides life-long immunity against the disease. People who recover from yellow fever infection are also protected for life. Read more about the yellow fever vaccine. Mosquito control can also help to prevent yellow fever and is vital in situations where vaccination coverage is low or the vaccine is not immediately available. Mosquito control includes eliminating sites where mosquitoes can breed and killing adult mosquitoes and larvae by using insecticides in areas with high mosquito density. Community involvement through activities, such as cleaning household drains and covering water containers where mosquitoes can breed is an important and effective way to control mosquitoes.

Human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness),https://www.who.int/health-topics/human-african-trypanosomiasis,"Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, is caused by trypanosome parasites that are transmitted by tsetse flies. HAT is found only in sub-Saharan Africa. Two subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei cause disease: T. b. gambiense in West and Central Africa, and T. b. rhodesiense in East Africa. This life-threatening disease mostly affects poor rural populations, causing significant harm. Travellers to endemic regions may also be at risk of infection. HAT transmission requires the interaction of humans, tsetse flies and parasite reservoirs (humans, and domestic and wild animals). The animal reservoir is very important in T. b. rhodesiense and less so in T. b. gambiense , although it could explain the long-term endemicity in some foci despite control interventions. Transmission can be interrupted by depleting the parasite reservoirs through detection and treatment of infected people and/or domestic animals and by reducing the tsetse fly population and human–tsetse contact. In 1995, about 25 000 cases were detected, 300 000 undetected cases were estimated and 60 million people were estimated to be at risk of HAT infection. In 2001, WHO launched an initiative to reinforce control and surveillance, and HAT decreased markedly in the ensuing years. Since 2019, fewer than 1000 cases are reported yearly. This reduction does not reflect a lack of control efforts as in general active and passive screening has been maintained at similar levels (around 2.5 million people screened per year).         After infection, trypanosomes multiply in the blood and lymph (first-stage, haemolymphatic) and, following a variable incubation period (from days to months), unspecific symptoms and signs such as headache, fever, weakness, joint pain, and lymphadenopathy appear. Over time, the parasites cross the blood–brain barrier to invade the central nervous system (second-stage, meningoencephalitic), causing various neurological disturbances including sleep disorders (excessive daytime sleepiness, nocturnal insomnia), deep sensory disturbances, abnormal movements, tremor, ataxia, walking difficulties, speech difficulties, psychiatric disorders, seizures, coma and ultimately death. Most signs and symptoms are common to both stages, and sleep disorders in particular can appear already during the first stage. Rhodesiense HAT is typically acute, progressing to second-stage within a few weeks, and to death within 6 months. Gambiense HAT progresses slowly over around 3 years (highly variable). An inoculation chancre (dermal reaction of 3–4 cm at the tsetse bite site) may appear 2–3 days after infection with rhodesiense HAT in up to 25% of local patients, but more frequently in patients from non-endemic regions. It is rare with gambiense HAT. Sleeping sickness is diagnosed in several steps: after a clinical suspicion, serological tests (card agglutination trypanosomiasis test or HAT rapid diagnostic tests) can reinforce the suspicion, which should be confirmed by parasitological findings (in chancre exudate, lymphatic juice, blood and cerebrospinal fluid). Unfortunately, the usual serological tests are only applicable to T. b. gambiense. Stage is determined by the number of white blood cells and the presence of trypanosomes in cerebrospinal fluid examination. All confirmed HAT cases require treatment. Available treatment can cure most patients, completely eliminating trypanosomes from the body. Treatment of cases suspected by serology depends on specific conditions set by national protocols, which usually
    set specific conditions defining a higher suspicion index. The current treatment options include six medicines, all of which are donated by the manufacturers; WHO ensures their worldwide distribution free of charge. Treatment choices are based on the causative trypanosome and the disease stage. The medicines for treatment of second-stage must cross the blood–brain barrier and tend to be more toxic and complex to administer than first-stage medicines. In 2019, WHO issued interim guidelines for treatment of gambiense HAT . For treatment
    of rhodesiense HAT, the former guidelines remain valid. Gambiense HAT can be treated with oral fexinidazole in first-stage and also non-severe second-stage, with some limitations of age and body weight and following some important specific rules to ensure efficacy. In first-stage, intramuscular
    pentamidine can be also used, and in second stage nifurtimox–eflornithine combination therapy (NECT). Rhodesiense HAT must be treated without delay, because it can provoke multi-organ failure and progress to second stage within a few weeks. In first-stage, the treatment is intravenous suramin, with pentamidine as an alternative. In second-stage,
    the only treatment is intravenous melarsoprol.                                                                    ",WHO
Gender and health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/gender,"Gender refers to the characteristics of women, men, girls and boys that are socially constructed.  This includes norms, behaviours and roles associated with being a woman, man, girl or boy, as well as relationships with each other. As a social construct, gender varies from society to society and can change over time. Gender is hierarchical and produces inequalities that intersect with other social and economic inequalities.  Gender-based discrimination intersects with other factors of discrimination, such as ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability, age, geographic location, gender identity and sexual orientation, among others. This is referred to as intersectionality. Gender interacts with but is different from sex, which refers to the different biological and physiological characteristics of females, males and intersex persons, such as chromosomes, hormones and reproductive organs. Gender and sex are related to but different from gender identity. Gender identity refers to a person’s deeply felt, internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond to the person’s physiology or designated sex at birth. Gender influences people’s experience of and access to healthcare. The way that health services are organized and provided can either limit or enable a person’s access to healthcare information, support and services, and the outcome of those encounters. Health services should be affordable, accessible and acceptable to all, and they should be provided with quality, equity and dignity. Gender inequality and discrimination faced by women and girls puts their health and well-being at risk.  Women and girls often face greater barriers than men and boys to accessing health information and services. These barriers include restrictions on mobility; lack of access to decision-making power; lower literacy rates; discriminatory attitudes of communities and healthcare providers; and lack of training and awareness amongst healthcare providers and health systems of the specific health needs and challenges of women and girls. Consequently, women and girls face greater risks of unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections including HIV, cervical cancer, malnutrition, lower vision, respiratory infections, malnutrition and elder abuse, amongst others. Women and girls also face unacceptably high levels of violence rooted in gender inequality and are at grave risk of harmful practices such as female genital mutilation, and child, early and forced marriage. WHO figures show that about 1 in 3 women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime. Harmful gender norms – especially those related to rigid notions of masculinity – can also affect boys and men’s health and wellbeing negatively. For example, specific notions of masculinity may encourage boys and men to smoke, take sexual and other health risks, misuse alcohol and not seek help or health care. Such gender norms also contribute to boys and men perpetrating violence – as well as being subjected to violence themselves. They can also have grave implications for their mental health. Rigid gender norms also negatively affect people with diverse gender identities, who often face violence, stigma and discrimination as a result, including in healthcare settings. Consequently, they are at higher risk of HIV and mental health problems, including suicide.                                 The work of WHO is aligned with and supports the advancement of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages , and SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls . The Organization is committed to non-discrimination and to leaving no-one behind. It seeks to ensure that every person, regardless of gender or sex, can live a healthy life. Gender inequality hinders progress to fulfill everyone’s right to health. Efforts in support of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) must focus on reaching those most often left behind, such as marginalized, stigmatized and geographically isolated people of all sexes and gender identities, with a special focus on those in situations of increased vulnerability, including poor people, persons with disabilities and racialized and indigenous peoples. Addressing discrimination against women and girls is critical to achieving UHC. WHO develops norms, standards and guidelines on gender-responsive health service provision and delivery, and commissions research on issues focusing on gender equality, human rights and health equity. WHO also supports country-level action to strengthen health sector response to gender-based violence, as well as to address gender equality in health workforce development and gender-related barriers to health services.

Obesity,https://www.who.int/health-topics/obesity,"Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat
accumulation that presents a risk to health. A body mass index (BMI) over 25 is
considered overweight, and over 30 is obese. In 2019, an estimated 5
million noncommunicable disease (NCD) deaths were caused by higher-than-optimal
BMI. Rates of overweight and obesity continue to grow in adults and
children. From 1990 to 2022, the percentage of children and adolescents aged 5–19
years living with obesity increased four-fold from 2% to 8% globally, while the
percentage of adults 18 years of age and older living with obesity more than
doubled from 7% to 16%. Obesity is one side of the double burden of malnutrition , and today more people are obese than underweight in every region except the South-East Asia Region. Once considered a problem only in high-income countries, today some middle-income countries have among the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide.                                  Overweight and obesity are major risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and stroke, which are the leading causes of death worldwide. Being overweight can also lead to diabetes and its associated conditions, including blindness, limb amputations, and the need for dialysis. Rates of diabetes have quadrupled since around the world since 1980. Carrying excess weight can lead to musculoskeletal disorders including osteoarthritis. Obesity is also associated with some cancers, including endometrial, breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney and colon. The risk of these noncommunicable diseases increases even when a person is only slightly overweight and grows more serious as the body mass index (BMI) climbs. Obesity in childhood is associated with a wide range of serious health complications and an increased risk of premature onset of related illnesses. Studies have found that without intervention, children and adolescents with obesity will likely continue to be obese into adulthood. Many of the causes of overweight and obesity are preventable and reversable. Although other factors are involved, the fundamental cause of obesity is an imbalance of calories consumed and calories expended. As global diets have changed in recent decades, there has been an increase in the consumption of energy-dense foods high in fat and free sugars. There has also been a decrease in physical activity due to the changing nature of many types of work, more access to transportation and increased urbanization. Lowering the risk of overweight and obesity includes reducing the number of calories consumed from fats and sugars, increasing the portion of daily intake of fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains and nuts, and engaging in regular physical activity (60 minutes per day for children and 150 minutes per week for adults). In babies, studies have shown that exclusive breastfeeding from birth to 6 months of age reduces the risk of infants becoming overweight or obese.                                           ",WHO
Trachoma,https://www.who.int/health-topics/trachoma,"Trachoma is a disease of the eye and the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. It is caused by an obligate intracellular bacterium called Chlamydia trachomatis . Infection is transmitted from person to person by direct or indirect transfer of ocular and nasal discharges of infected people; indirect transfer includes carriage on the body of species of flies. Preschool-age children harbour the principal reservoir of infection. Models suggest that an individual requires more than 150 lifetime infections to develop the blinding complications of trachoma. Trachoma is endemic in some of the world’s poorest populations, who live in rural and remote areas and have highly inadequate access to water, sanitation and healthcare. Africa is the most affected continent, but it also has the most widespread control efforts. The disease is also found in Central and South America, Asia, Australia, and the Middle East. As of 19 March 2024, 18 countries had been validated as having eliminated trachoma as a public health problem. In 2022 alone, 129 224 people received surgical treatment for advanced trachoma, and 36.2 million were treated with antibiotics. Despite these successes, the disease remains a serious public health concern, with an estimated US$ 8 billion annual loss in productivity due to blindness and visual impairment.         Infection is associated with inflammatory changes in the conjunctiva known as “active trachoma”. An individual’s immune system can clear a single episode of infection, but in endemic communities, re-acquisition of the organism occurs frequently. After years of repeated episodes of active trachoma , the inside of the eyelid can become so severely scarred (trachomatous conjunctival scarring) that it turns inwards and causes the eyelashes to rub against the eyeball (trachomatous trichiasis), resulting in constant pain and light intolerance; this and other alterations of the eye can lead to scarring of the cornea. Left untreated, this condition leads to the formation of irreversible opacities, with resulting visual impairment or blindness. The age at which this occurs depends on several factors including local transmission intensity. In very highly endemic communities, it can occur in childhood, though onset of visual impairment between the ages of 30 and 40 years is more typical. Women are blinded up to four times as often as men, probably due to more frequent contact with infected children. Individuals living in the poorest and most remote communities of Africa, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, Central and South America and the Pacific Islands are at risk. Trachoma can be prevented by limiting environmental risk factors. These include inadequate hygiene, crowded households, inadequate access to water and inadequate access to and use of sanitation. Infections usually begin at an early age and grow less frequent
and shorter in duration with increasing age. Infections are most often acquired through family and contact with others with active disease. Repeated infections cause the most serious symptoms of the disease. Trachoma can be eliminated as a public health problem using the SAFE strategy, comprising: S urgery to treat trachomatous trichiasis, the blinding stage of the disease; A ntibiotics to clear infection, particularly mass drug administration of the antibiotic azithromycin, which is donated by the manufacturer to national programmes through the International Trachoma Initiative; F acial cleanliness; and E nvironmental improvement, particularly better access to water and sanitation. WHO adopted the SAFE strategy in 1993 and continues in its mandate to provide leadership and coordination of international efforts to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem.

Violence against women,https://www.who.int/health-topics/violence-against-women,"Violence against women – particularly intimate partner violence and sexual violence – is a major public and clinical health problem and a violation of women's human rights. It is rooted in and perpetuates gender inequalities. Globally 1 in 3 women experience physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime, mostly by an intimate partner. This is a stark reminder of the scale of gender inequality and discrimination against women. The United Nations defines violence against women as ""any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life."" Intimate partner violence refers to behaviour by an intimate partner or ex-partner that causes physical, sexual or psychological harm, including physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behaviours. Sexual violence is ""any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, or other act directed against a person’s sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting. It includes rape, defined as the physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the vulva or anus with a penis, other body part or object.""     Violence against women is a global problem of pandemic proportions. It causes devastating, harm to women’s lives and that of their children. It also hurts the economic and social health of their families, communities, and countries. While some women are more at risk than others, violence can happen to any woman, in any country – regardless of culture, religion or economic status. Gender inequality including harmful gender norms are key drivers of violence against women. Violence can negatively affect women’s physical, mental, sexual, and reproductive health. It is associated with increased risk of injuries, depression, anxiety disorders, unplanned pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections,  HIV and many other health problems . Children who grow up in families where there is violence may suffer a range of behavioural and emotional disturbances. These can lead to mental and development problems and also be associated with perpetrating or experiencing violence later in life.        WHO plays a key role in bringing attention to and responding to violence against women as a public health and gender equality issue through: Research and evidence-building to highlight the magnitude of violence against women, its risk factors and consequences, and to identify effective interventions for prevention and response. Developing guidelines and tools, setting norms and standards for an effective health response to violence against women. Strengthening country capacity of health systems and providers to prevent and respond to violence against women. Encouraging leadership in health systems and building political will to address violence against women through advocacy and partnerships. The WHO 13 th General Programme of Work (GPW) includes violence against women as part of its contribution to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 on gender equality and women’s empowerment (specifically, SDG 5.2 on the elimination of violence against women and girls). At the World Health Assembly in May 2016, Member States endorsed a global plan of action on strengthening the role of the health systems in addressing interpersonal violence, in particular against women and girls and against children.

Deliberate events,https://www.who.int/health-topics/deliberate-events,"Deliberate events (DEs) are malicious act with intentions to cause harm to the target. Traditionally, DEs involve the use of hazardous substances such as chemicals, biological agents, toxins or radio-nuclear materials (CBRN) while emerging threats include disinformation, misuse of digital, cyber means and other new technologies. DEs can cause harm in several ways, for example through the intentional release of a harmful material or a dangerous pathogen directly targeting humans and/or animals, or indirectly through contaminating food or water, destroying crops or damaging the environment. Addressing DEs involves both health and security dimensions. The health sector’s role is to protect and manage the health and well-being of those at risk of or affected by DEs. The security sector and law enforcement’s role is to identify and control the source of the DE and prevent the situation from worsening (see Strengthening the global health-security interface ). Preparing for DEs is an integral part of developing and updating national emergency preparedness and response plans. The work of WHO focuses on increasing Member States’ awareness, preparedness and readiness related to DEs and developing the Organization’s capacity to coordinate the international public health response to a DE.             Similar to non-deliberate event response, WHO experts can be deployed at country, regional and global levels to support the DE response upon the request of the affected Member State(s). Specific WHO response activities specific to DEs include: working with international or national partners and laboratories to characterize the nature, scope, and impact of the DE; offering targeted training to public health and frontline responders; facilitating the identification and acquisition of necessary response materials (such as personal protective equipment or medical countermeasures) and providing medical countermeasures in certain circumstances; and coordinating additional international expert support through WHO Networks including the Global Outbreak and Response Network (GOARN), WHO Collaborating Centres, or the UN Humanitarian Emergency Cluster system. WHO can join the United Nations Secretary-General’s mechanism (UNSGM) in very specific cases. The nature and cause of an event may not be clear when the response is initiated and may or may not be conclusively determined over time. WHO does not have mandate to lead or investigate an attribution process, though WHO may collaborate with and support other entities whose role is to determine the identity of the perpetrators of a DE.                       Preparing for deliberate events (DEs) is an integral part of developing and updating national emergency preparedness and response plans. WHO advises Member States to 1) strengthen public health surveillance and preparedness activities and to 2) link public health and security authorities to prepare for possible DEs, with an emphasis on: evaluating and identifying gaps in national preparedness and readiness, as well as national capacities to manage risks posed by deliberate exposure to hazardous materials, disinformation or cyberattacks. This could be done by using the section dedicated to DE (1) of the National Self-Assessment toolkit (NSAT), which provides a baseline measurement of national capacity and capabilities related to DEs. NSAT is typically used in preparation for a Joint External Evaluation (JEE) or as part of a National Action Plan for Health Security (NAPHS) ; developing training material packages for online ( OpenWHO course series ) and in-person sessions; identifying and recommending actions to fill gaps in readiness by conducting DE simulation exercises in collaboration with relevant partners; developing national, sub-national or local stockpile systems to provide deployable pharmaceuticals, supplies and equipment to support rapid national response operations; and putting in place national protocols or formal agreements to work with partners and benefit from international assistance for responses.

Energy and health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/energy-and-health,"Energy and health are inextricably linked. Access to clean, sustainable and affordable energy, outlined in the seventh Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 7), plays a crucial role in advancing health (SDG 3). Energy is also critical for achieving almost all other global goals that include eradication of poverty (SDG 1), opportunities for quality education (SDG 4), achievement of gender equality (SDG 5), access to clean water (SDG 6), jobs security and economic growth (SDG 8) and combat of climate change (SDG 13). The links between energy and health are particularly evident in homes and health-care facilities. Access to clean and sustainable energy in homes is essential to protect people’s health from household air pollution due to the use of polluting stoves and fuels such as coal and biomass. Access to clean and reliable energy in health-care facilities is important to ensure the delivery of essential health care services for disease prevention and treatment.     Globally, 2.4 billion people lack access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking. Household air pollution, emitted from the use of polluting stoves and fuels, is a cause of some 3.2 million deaths annually. Women and children in particular are at greater health and livelihood risks since they are often tasked with cooking and collecting fuelwood. Health burdens are even greater when the use of polluting energy for other purposes (e.g., space heating, lighting) are included. Recent statistics show population growth currently outpaces increases in energy access in some regions, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. It remains the only region in which the number of people without access to clean fuels and technologies is rising. Only about 1 in 5 people in sub-Saharan Africa (17%) has access to clean cooking. Overall, more people without access to clean fuels and technologies reside in sub-Saharan Africa than in any other region, with around 83% of the population (about 900 million people) in the region lacking access to clean cooking. Access to energy also plays a critical role in the functionality of health-care facilities and the quality, accessibility and reliability of health services delivered to all. Yet, an estimated 1 billion people globally are served by health facilities without electricity. Around 25% of health-care facilities in 11 sub-Saharan African countries are estimated to have no access to electricity. While most large hospitals have access, rates drop dramatically for rural and remote clinics. Unless rapid action is taken, the world will fall short of the universal access target for clean cooking, leaving more than one fifth (24%) of the population still lacking access in 2030, making them vulnerable to health and other consequences. Scaling up the adoption to clean cooking solutions is needed through awareness raising, policies, financing, innovative delivery models and technology development. Furthermore, electricity is necessary for the operation of critically needed medical devices such as vaccine refrigerators and surgical emergency, laboratory and diagnostic equipment as well as for the operation of basic amenities such as lighting, clean water supply, cooling, ventilation, space heating and communications. Electricity is critical to health improvement and health protection and in many cases, it can make the difference between life and death. Through integrated approaches to health and energy challenges, WHO works towards accelerating access to clean cooking and electricity for health-care facilities. By working closely with the energy sector, the health sector can make critical steps in achieving health targets for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and pneumonia prevention, vaccine coverage, digital health as well as improve emergency preparedness and response.

Plague,https://www.who.int/health-topics/plague,"Plague is an infectious disease caused by Yersinia pestis bacteria, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. The disease is transmitted between animals via their fleas and, as it is a zoonotic bacterium, it can also transmit from animals to humans. Humans can be contaminated by the bite of infected fleas, through direct contact with infected materials, or by inhalation. Plague can be a very severe disease in people, particularly in its septicaemic and pneumonic forms, with a case-fatality ratio
of 30% - 100% if left untreated. Although plague has been responsible for widespread pandemics throughout history, including the so-called Black Death that caused over 50 million deaths in Europe during the fourteenth century, today it can be easily treated with antibiotics and the use of standard preventative measures. Plague is found on all continents except Oceania but most human cases since the 1990s have occurred in Africa. Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar and Peru are the three most endemic countries.         People infected with plague usually develop influenza-like symptoms after an incubation period of 3–7 days. Symptoms include fever, chills, aches, weakness, vomiting and nausea. There are 3 main forms of plague. Bubonic plague is the most common and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. The plague bacillus, Y. pestis , enters at the bite and travels to the nearest lymph node to replicate. The lymph node becomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a bubo. With advanced infections, the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into suppurating open sores. Bubonic plague cannot be transmitted from human to human. Septicaemic plague occurs when infection spreads through the bloodstream. It may result from flea bites or from direct contact with infective materials through cracks in the skin. Advanced stages of the bubonic form of plague will also lead to direct spread of Y. pestis in the blood. Pneumonic plague – or lung-based plague – is the most virulent and least common form of plague. Typically, it is caused by spread to the lungs from advanced bubonic plague. However, a person with secondary pneumonic plague may form aerosolized infective droplets and transmit plague to other humans. This is usually fatal. Untreated plague can be rapidly fatal, so early diagnosis and treatment is essential for survival and to reduce complications. Antibiotics and supportive therapy are effective against plague if patients are diagnosed in time. Laboratory testing is required to confirm infection. This includes identifying the causative bacteria in a sample of pus from a bubo, blood or sputum. WHO does not recommend vaccination except for high-risk people such as laboratory personnel and health
care workers. Preventive measures include informing people when zoonotic plague is present in their environment and giving advice on how they can protect themselves. They should be advised to take precautions against flea bites and not to handle animal carcasses. People,
especially health workers, should also avoid direct contact with infected tissues such as buboes, or close exposure to patients with pneumonic plague.

Ebola virus disease,https://www.who.int/health-topics/ebola,"Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans and other primates. The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals (such as fruit bats, porcupines and non-human primates) and then spreads in the human population through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids. The average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks. The first EVD outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests. The 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976. There were more cases and deaths in this outbreak than all others combined. It also spread between countries, starting in Guinea then moving across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia. It is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural Ebola virus hosts.         The incubation period, that is, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms, is from 2 to 21 days. A person infected with Ebola cannot spread the disease until they develop symptoms. Symptoms of EVD can be sudden and include: fever, fatigue, muscle, pain, headache, and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases internal and external bleeding (e.g. oozing from the gums, blood in the stools). Laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes. It can be difficult to clinically distinguish EVD from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis. A range of diagnostic tests have been developed to confirm the presence of the virus.                            Supportive care - rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids - and treatment of specific symptoms improves survival. A range of potential treatments including blood products, immune therapies and drug therapies are currently being evaluated. In the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in DRC, the  first-ever multi-drug randomized control trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of drugs used in the treatment of Ebola patients under an ethical framework developed in consultation with experts in the field and the DRC. Two monoclonal antibodies (Inmazeb and Ebanga) were approved for the treatment of Zaire ebolavirus (Ebolavirus) infection in adults and children by the US Food and Drug Administration in late 2020. The Ervebo vaccine has been shown to be effective in protecting people from the species Zaire ebolavirus, and is recommended by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization as part of a broader set of Ebola outbreak response tools. In December 2020, the vaccine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and prequalified by WHO for use in individuals 18 years of age and older (except for pregnant and breastfeeding women) for protection against Ebola virus disease caused by Zaïre Ebola virus. In May 2020, the European Medicines Agency recommended granting marketing authorization for a 2-component vaccine called Zabdeno-and-Mvabea for individuals 1 year and older. The vaccine is delivered in 2 doses: Zabdeno is administered first and Mvabea is given approximately 8 weeks later as a second dose. This prophylactic 2-dose regimen is therefore not suitable for an outbreak response where immediate protection is necessary.                                         ",WHO
Health system governance,https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-systems-governance,"Health systems governance refers to the processes, structures and institutions that are in place to oversee and manage a country's healthcare system. It manages the relationships between different actors and stakeholders involved in healthcare, including government agencies, healthcare providers, patients and their families, people and communities, civil society organizations and private sector entities. Health systems governance means ensuring strategic policy frameworks exist and are combined with effective oversight, coalition-building, provision of appropriate regulations and incentives, attention to system design, and accountability. Effective health systems governance is essential for ensuring that healthcare services are accessible, equitable, efficient, affordable and of high quality for all. This requires efficient and equitable allocation of healthcare resources, the presence of policies and regulations guiding healthcare delivery, and mechanisms for monitoring, evaluating and reviewing the healthcare system’s performance. Moreover, health systems governance plays a crucial role in promoting equity and social justice in healthcare. It strives to ensure that the healthcare system is responsive to the needs of all members of society, regardless of their socioeconomic status, ethnicity, culture, gender or other factors.     For WHO, health systems governance involves not only the development of policy tools, techniques and methods but also what policy looks like in practice, including its goals and intentions. Based on this approach, WHO’s work on health systems governance aims to assist Member States in: developing strategic policy frameworks that articulate the country’s policy vision (e.g. through national health policies, strategies and plans); operationalizing these policy frameworks through relevant policy instruments, including legal instruments (e.g. laws and regulations); building coalitions and partnerships with all relevant stakeholders, such as civil society and the private sector, to provide guidance in the development, implementation and review of health policy and programmes; shaping the system design and establishing the overall architecture of the health system, tailoring powers and duties to fit the unique context of the country; and providing accountability and oversight mechanisms to ensure effective policy implementation and impact, as well as addressing market failures. In the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda, WHO is committed to supporting countries to exercise effective health systems governance, with a specific focus on strengthening the capacity of governments to formulate and implement strategies that will lead to the realization of UHC by 2030. In line with the Thirteenth General Programme of Work 2019–2023, WHO works collaboratively across its three organizational levels, adopting a horizontal approach to pursue the following key objectives: call upon countries to strengthen the governance of their health systems for UHC provide guidance on ways to enhance health systems governance support regions and countries in strengthening their health systems governance as needed. WHO’s work on the health systems governance not only supports countries in advancing the UHC agenda but has an impact on reaching the targets beyond SDG 3. Improvements in health systems governance will support achieving results in both health and non-health-related SDGs, such as ending poverty (SDG 1), achieving gender equality (SDG 5), reducing inequalities (SDG 10), building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions (SDG 16), etc.                                                                        ",WHO
One Health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/one-health,"One Health is an integrated, unifying approach that aims to sustainably balance and optimize the health of people, animals and ecosystems. It recognizes that the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants, and the wider environment (including ecosystems) are closely linked and interdependent. While health, food, water, energy and environment are all wider topics with sector-specific concerns, the collaboration across sectors and disciplines contributes to protect health, address health challenges such as the emergence of infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance, and food safety and promote the health and integrity of our ecosystems. By linking humans, animals and the environment, One Health can help to address the full spectrum of disease control – from prevention to detection, preparedness, response and management – and contribute to global health security. The approach can be applied at the community, subnational, national, regional and global levels, and relies on shared and effective governance, communication, collaboration and coordination. Having the One Health approach in place makes it easier for people to better understand the co-benefits, risks, trade-offs and opportunities to advance equitable and holistic solutions.     COVID-19 has led to the loss of millions of lives and trillions of dollars from the global economy, an impact that needs to be avoided in the future. The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has underlined the need to strengthen the One Health approach, with a greater emphasis on connections to the environment, as well as promoting a healthy and green recovery from COVID-19, as described in the WHO manifesto for a healthy recovery from COVID-19 . Human health is a pillar of global health security that is sustained directly and indirectly through access to clean air and fresh water, safe food and healthy sustainable diets, and the availability of and access to medicines. As we come together as a community in the aftermath of this global pandemic, we have an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen cross-sectoral collaboration; increase policy coordination and coherence supported by a more systematic use of robust scientific evidence; and promote the development of integrated indicators and safeguards to address upstream drivers of disease, with a focus on prevention. These efforts will not only contribute to the prevention of future pandemics but will help to build more resilient and equitable systems, environments, economies and societies. In the context of the renewed interest from Member States to strengthen work on One Health and prevention of emerging zoonoses and the work of WHO Governing bodies on One Health, the WHO One Health Initiative team was set up to serve as the Secretariat of One Health High-Level Expert Panel (OHHLEP), WHO coordination mechanism for its One Health activities and the quadripartite collaboration. Investing in One Health contributes to WHO’s vision to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable. WHO works to integrate the One Health approach into the global health narrative, grounded in strong political leadership, technical expertise and inclusive implementation led and owned by countries. WHO and partner organizations are working to increase the adoption of the One Health approach in national, regional and international health policies through intersectoral political and strategic leadership; operationalizing responses and scaling up of country support, including research and policy assessment; strengthening country capacities; and monitoring of risks and preparedness for early detection and response to emerging pathogens. Through combined energies of the Quadripartite organizations (FAO, OIE, UNEP and WHO), a comprehensive One Health Joint Plan of Action is in development, supported and advised by the One Health High-Level Expert Panel. The Plan aims to mainstream and operationalize One Health at the global, regional and national levels; support countries in establishing and achieving national targets and priorities for interventions; mobilize investment; promote a whole of society approach; and enable collaboration, learning and exchange across regions, countries and sectors.

Diphtheria,https://www.who.int/health-topics/diphtheria,"Diphtheria is a serious infection caused by strains of the bacteria called Corynebacterium diphtheriae which makes a toxin. The toxin attaches itself most commonly to tissues in the respiratory system and causes disease by killing healthy tissue. Typical symptoms of the infection include a sore throat, fever, swollen neck glands and weakness. Within 2–3 days from infection, the dead tissue forms a thick, grey coating that can cover tissues in the nose, tonsils and throat, making it hard to breathe and swallow. More rarely, the toxin gets into the blood stream and causes damage to the heart, kidneys and nerves. Diphtheria bacteria spread from person to person, usually through respiratory droplets, like from coughing or sneezing. People can also get sick from touching infected open sores or ulcers. Those at increased risk of getting sick include household contacts, those exposed to secretions from the patient and those with frequent and close contact with the infected person.              Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease and is included in all countries' essential immunization programme. Diphtheria vaccine is a bacterial toxoid, i.e. a toxin whose toxicity has been inactivated. Currently available diphtheria vaccines are very effective in preventing this disease. WHO recommends a 3-dose primary vaccination series with diphtheria- containing vaccine, followed by 3 booster doses. The primary series should begin as early as 6 weeks of age with subsequent doses given with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses. The 3 booster doses should preferably be given during the second year of life (12–23 months), at 4–7 years and at 9–15 years of age. Ideally, there should be at least 4 years between booster doses to achieve long term protection. The vaccine can be given in combination with other vaccines such as tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Hemophilus influenzae b and polio. People who get a diphtheria vaccine may experience mild side effects. Serious side effects are rare.                        Treatment for diphtheria includes antibiotics to get rid of the bacteria. For serious illnesses, diphtheria antitoxin is used to stop the bacterial toxin from causing damage to the respiratory system and other parts of the body. Anyone who has had diphtheria should also receive the vaccine after the acute phase of the illness is over. Close contacts of a person with diphtheria may also be treated with antibiotics.  This prevents further spread of the bacteria. The specific antibiotics used will depend on local known antibiotic resistance patterns. The risk of complications or death decrease considerably if appropriate treatment is provided early in the course of illness. For this reason, if diphtheria is suspected, testing to confirm the disease should be done promptly, and treatment should be started as soon as possible.                                        ",WHO
Primary health care,https://www.who.int/health-topics/primary-health-care,"All people, everywhere, have the right to achieve the highest attainable level of health. This is the fundamental premise of primary health care (PHC). Primary health care is a whole-of-society approach to effectively organize and strengthen national health systems to bring services for health and wellbeing closer to communities. It has 3 components: integrated health services to meet people’s health needs throughout their lives addressing the broader determinants of health through multisectoral policy and action empowering individuals, families and communities to take charge of their own health. Primary health care enables health systems to support a person’s health needs – from health promotion to disease prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, palliative care and more. This strategy also ensures that health care is delivered in a way that is centred on people’s needs and respects their preferences. Primary health care is widely regarded as the most inclusive, equitable and cost-effective way to achieve universal health coverage. It is also key to strengthening the resilience of health systems to prepare for, respond to and recover from shocks and crises.     Universal health coverage will only be possible when everyone, everywhere can access the health services they need. Communities should be empowered to identify their health priorities and contribute to finding responsive solutions. Heath care and other sectors need to work together to ensure all decisions affecting health are addressed in an integrated way. This includes promoting policies to protect and improve people’s health and well-being; providing information, services and infrastructure for improved water and sanitation and other environmental determinants of health; prevention of noncommunicable diseases; preparing for and responding to health emergencies; providing services for pregnant women, routine vaccination for children and sexual and reproductive health services; mental health support; platforms for community consultation and many others. Primary health care brings these factors together to ensure the highest possible level of health and well-being and their equitable distribution. The impact is seen in health systems that focus on people’s needs and are as close as feasible to their everyday environment. Primary health care-oriented health systems consistently produce better outcomes, enhanced equity and improved efficiency. Scaling up primary health care interventions across low- and middle-income countries could save 60 million lives and increase average life expectancy by 3.7 years by 2030.        WHO supports Member States in taking a primary health care approach to accelerate progress in achieving universal health coverage. Countries are demonstrating how this strategy has been effective in strengthening their health systems to address people’s needs, both in times of crisis as in normal times. The principles of primary health care were first outlined in the Declaration of Alma-Ata in 1978, a seminal milestone in global health. Forty years later, global leaders ratified the Declaration of Astana at the Global Conference on Primary Health Care which took place in Astana, Kazakhstan in October 2018. The following year, at the UN high-level meeting on universal health coverage , countries declared their commitment to “expand the delivery of and prioritize primary health care as a cornerstone of a sustainable people-centred, community-based and integrated health system and the foundation for achieving universal health coverage.” To support Member States in translating this commitment into practical actions that are aligned with national contexts and priorities, WHO established the Special Programme on Primary Health Care and, together with UNICEF, released the Operational Framework for Primary Health Care and the Primary health care measurement framework and indicators.

Stillbirth,https://www.who.int/health-topics/stillbirth,"A baby who dies after 28 weeks of pregnancy, but before or during birth, is classified as a stillbirth. There are nearly 2 million stillbirths every year – one every 16 seconds. Over 40% of all stillbirths occur during labour – a loss that could be avoided with improved quality and respectful care during childbirth including routine monitoring and timely access to emergency obstetric care when required. Experiencing a stillbirth during pregnancy or childbirth is a tragedy insufficiently addressed in global agendas, policies and funded programmes. There are psychological costs, especially to women and their families, such as maternal depression, financial consequences and economic repercussions, as well as stigma and taboo. In 2014, the World Health Assembly endorsed the Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP), which includes a global target of 12 or fewer third trimester (late) stillbirths per 1,000 total births in every country by 2030. In 2021, 139 mainly high-income and upper middle-income countries had met this target, but 56 countries will not each the ENAP target by 2030 if further efforts are not made. If current trends continue, 15.9 million babies will be stillborn; nearly half of these (7.7 million, 48%) will occur in sub-Saharan Africa.             More needs to be done to integrate stillbirth prevention within global and national agendas for high quality health care for women, adolescents, and babies. Through the Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents Health 2016–2030 and implementing the recommendations of the Every Newborn Action Plan (2014), WHO is working to end preventable stillbirths, as part of efforts to improve maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health. Most stillbirths do not receive a birth certificate and are not registered. Improving systems for reporting births and neonatal deaths is a matter of human rights and a prerequisite for reducing stillbirths. In addition, there is a need to strengthen routine health information systems to accurately capture and report stillbirths for monitoring and improving the quality of care. WHO provides tools to help countries improve their data on both stillbirths and neonatal deaths. WHO also has guidance to help countries review and investigate individual deaths so they can recommend and implement solutions to prevent similar ones in the future and a standard classification system for perinatal deaths (ICD-PM). WHO and UNICEF are supporting a call for collective action to end preventable stillbirths by: increasing awareness and reducing stigma supporting bereaved women and families strengthening health systems to provide high-quality care nationalizing and localizing stillbirth targets improving measurement of stillbirths to enhance evidence and knowledge.             With quality health care throughout pregnancy and childbirth, most stillbirths are preventable. The major causes of stillbirth include pregnancy and childbirth-related complications, prolonged pregnancy, maternal infections such as malaria, syphilis and HIV, maternal conditions especially hypertension, and diabetes, and fetal growth restriction (when an unborn baby is unable to achieve its growth potential and therefore smaller than it should be). Congenital abnormalities are responsible for less than 10% of stillbirths reported nationally in high-income countries and the exact proportion in low-income settings is unknown due to limitations in diagnostics. Factors related to age of the mother and practicing smoking can also increase the risk of maternal disease and stillbirth. Stillbirths can be prevented through family planning to avoid unwanted pregnancies, good health and nutrition prior to and during pregnancy, quality and respectful antenatal and childbirth care including adequate skilled health personnel including midwives. Syphilis treatment in pregnancy could also prevent an estimated 200 000 stillbirths, while fetal heart rate monitoring and labour surveillance and prompt interventions when needed are crucial for preventing 832 000 intrapartum stillbirths and reducing neonatal deaths. Stillbirths are strongly linked to adverse social and economic determinants of health. Prevention and responsive care need to be integrated across the continuum of maternal health care, and beyond. This includes respectful and supportive care in the event of a death. Listening to the experiences and voices of women and their communities is essential to help address issues of stigma associated with stillbirth.

Leprosy (Hansen disease),https://www.who.int/health-topics/leprosy,"Leprosy, also known as Hansen disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused mainly by a type of bacteria called Mycobacterium leprae . The disease affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes. Apart from the physical deformity, persons affected by leprosy also face stigmatization and discrimination. However, leprosy is curable and treatment in the early stages can prevent disability. The disease is believed to be transmitted through inhalation of droplets from the nose and mouth of an untreated case of leprosy, containing the causative agent, following prolonged, close contact. The disease does not spread through casual contact (like shaking hands or hugging, sharing meals, or sitting next to each other). The patient stops transmitting the disease upon initiation of treatment.         Symptoms may occur within one year of being infected but can also take as long as 20 years or even more. The disease manifests commonly through skin lesion and peripheral nerve involvement. Skin lesion usually has a different pigmentation than the surrounding normal skin (less pigmented or reddish) and may have various presentations (flat, raised or nodules). Skin lesion can be single or multiple with a definite loss of sensation. Leprosy is a highly variable disease, affecting people in different ways, according to their immune response. The diagnosis of leprosy is done clinically. Laboratory-based services may be required in cases that are difficult to diagnose. The diagnosis of leprosy is based on at least one of the following cardinal signs: (i) definite loss of sensation in a pale (hypopigmented) or reddish skin patch; (ii) thickened or enlarged peripheral nerve, with loss of sensation and/or weakness of the muscles supplied by that nerve; (iii) microscopic detection of bacilli in a slit-skin smear. Based on the above, cases of leprosy are classified into two types for treatment purposes: a paucibacillary (PB) case or a multibacillary (MB) case. PB case: a case of leprosy with 1–5 skin lesions, without demonstrated presence of bacilli in a skin smear. MB case: a case of leprosy with more than five skin lesions; or with nerve involvement (pure neuritis, or any number of skin lesions and neuritis); or with the demonstrated presence of bacilli in a slit-skin smear, irrespective of the number of skin lesions. Leprosy is a curable disease. The currently recommended treatment regimen consists of three medicines (dapsone, rifampicin and clofazimine) and is referred to as multidrug therapy (MDT). The same regimen with a duration of 6 months for PB and 12 months for MB cases has been recommended by WHO. MDT kills the pathogen and cures the patient. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment can help to prevent disabilities. WHO has been providing MDT free of cost. Free MDT was initially funded by The Nippon Foundation (TNF) and has been donated by Novartis since 2000.

Infertility,https://www.who.int/health-topics/infertility,"Infertility is a global health issue affecting millions of people of reproductive age
    worldwide. Available data suggests that globally one in six people experience infertility in their lifetime. Infertility is a disease of the male or female
    reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or
    more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. Primary infertility is the inability to
    have any pregnancy, while secondary infertility is the inability to have a pregnancy
    after previously successful conception. WHO’s International Classification of Diseases
    provides more information on the many primary and secondary causes of infertility in
    both women and men. Infertility may occur due to male factors, female factors, a combination of male and
    female factors or may be unexplained. For both women and men, however,
    lifestyle factors such as smoking, excessive alcohol intake and obesity
    have been associated with higher chances of infertility.     Every human being has a right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Individuals and couples have the right to decide the number, timing and spacing of their children. Addressing infertility is therefore an
important part of realizing the right of individuals and couples to found a family. A wide variety of people globally may require infertility management and fertility care services. Disparities in access to fertility care services adversely affect the poor, unmarried, uneducated, unemployed
and other underserved and marginalised populations. Infertility has significant negative impacts on the lives of infertile couples. Women in particular are at greater risk of violence, divorce, social stigma, emotional stress, depression, anxiety
and low self-esteem. In some settings, fear of infertility can deter women and men from using contraception if they feel socially pressured to prove their fertility at an early age because of a high social value of childbearing. Infertility can also
have negative economic impact when households incur catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure to access treatment.        Availability, access, and quality of interventions to address infertility remain a
challenge in most countries. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infertility are often not prioritized in national policies and are rarely covered through public health
financing. A lack of necessary equipment and trained personnel, together with the high
costs of treatment, are additional barriers preventing universal access to fertility care.
While assisted reproduction technology (ART) has been available for over three
decades, it is still largely unaffordable in many parts of the world. The World Health Organization is committed to addressing infertility and is currently working on a programme on infertility research and fertility care. It is also developing guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of male and female infertility, as part of global norms and standards. WHO is engaging with countries to address infertility within an enabling legal and
policy environment and to support the generation of data on the burden of infertility.
WHO is working with relevant stakeholders including academic centres, ministries of
health, UN organizations, non-state actors and other partners to strengthen political
commitment, and health system capacity related to fertility care.                                                                 ",WHO
Dengue and severe dengue,https://www.who.int/health-topics/dengue-and-severe-dengue,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection common in warm, tropical climates. It is caused by any one of four closely related dengue viruses (called serotypes), which can lead to a broad spectrum of symptoms, including some that are extremely mild (unnoticeable) to those who may require medical intervention and hospitalization. In severe cases, fatalities can occur. There is no treatment for the infection itself, but the symptoms that a patient experiences can be managed. In 2023, WHO graded dengue as a Grade 3 emergency after outbreaks increased in several countries. Dengue epidemics tend to have seasonal patterns, with transmission often peaking during and after rainy seasons . Several factors contribute to this increase, including high mosquito population levels, susceptibility to circulating serotypes, favourable air temperatures , precipitation and humidity, all of which affect the reproduction and feeding patterns of mosquito populations, as well as the dengue virus incubation period. Unplanned urbanization and climatic factors such as heat waves and high temperatures have increased the intensity, frequency, duration and distribution of dengue in recent years. Lack of sustained surveillance and control interventions as well as staff are some of the other challenges. Absence of an integrated programmatic approach continues to affect countries.         Dengue is a self-limiting febrile illness with symptoms ranging from extremely mild (asymptomatic) to severe. Symptoms of dengue may be observed around 4–10 days after the bite of an infected mosquito. Common symptoms are like those of the flu, with patients experiencing: fever, headaches, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, nausea/vomiting, rash and fatigue. As the disease progresses, patients can also experience respiratory distress, bleeding from the nose and gums and rapid drop in blood pressure leading to shock. If left unmanaged, this can lead to death. Sound case management of dengue in hospitals has helped to reduce case-fatality rates to less than 1% in most affected countries. Dengue is increasing at a faster rate than any other communicable disease, with a significant increase over 24 years (2000–2024). Annual dengue incidence is estimated to be in the order of 100 million symptomatic cases a year, with another ~300 million asymptomatic infections. The greatest burden is seen in Asia (75%), followed by Latin America and Africa. 2024 recorded the highest levels of dengue with 14 305 764 cases and 10 576 deaths reported from 112 countries to WHO. WHO has established a global dengue surveillance dashboard to track cases from all regions. ( https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/dengue_global/ ) There are no specific antiviral treatments against dengue fever. Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) is indicated to bring down the fever. Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) and related non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as Ibuprofen) should be avoided. Recovery from infection by one dengue virus provides lifelong immunity against that particular virus serotype. However, this immunity confers only partial and transient protection against subsequent infection by the other three serotypes of the virus. Evidence suggests that sequential infection increases the risk of developing severe dengue. The time interval between infections and the particular viral sequence of infections may also be of importance. Currently, only one vaccine is available for dengue prevention. WHO recommends the use of Q-denga (TAK-003) in children aged 6–16 years in settings with high intensity of dengue transmission. The vaccination course consists of two injections given 3 months apart The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes during the daytime. Mosquitoes that transmit dengue virus often live in and around the home and in the garden. People should: wear clothing that covers the body well      (especially the legs and feet); keep mosquitoes out of the house by      placing insect screens over doors and windows; apply insect repellents according to the      manufacturer’s label instructions; sleep under a net, during the day; take extra precautions to prevent      transmission if a family member is infected by avoiding mosquito bites;      and clean the surroundings and prevent water      stagnation in and around homes.

Infection prevention and control,https://www.who.int/health-topics/infection-prevention-and-control,"Infection prevention and control (IPC) is a practical, evidence-based approach preventing patients and health workers from being harmed by avoidable infections. Effective IPC requires constant action at all levels of the health system, including policymakers, facility managers, health workers and those who access health services. IPC is unique in the field of patient safety and quality of care, as it is universally relevant to every health worker and patient, at every health care interaction. Defective IPC causes harm and can kill. Without effective IPC it is impossible to achieve quality health care delivery. Infection prevention and control effects all aspects of health care, including hand hygiene, surgical site infections, injection safety, antimicrobial resistance and how hospitals operate during and outside of emergencies. Programmes to support IPC are particularly important in low- and middle-income countries, where health care delivery and medical hygiene standards may be negatively affected by secondary infections.      Much of the work done on infection prevention and control (IPC) is hidden, as by its nature it prevents issues rather than treating them after the fact. However, health care-associated infections (HAIs) are an ongoing problem that no health authority can afford to ignore. To help in this fight, WHO has created a number of programmes and campaigns that set standards for evidence-based recommendations and operating procedures and promote behaviours to limit avoidable infections. The first WHO Global Patient Challenge laid the foundations for the IPC Global Unit, which works to support country capacity-building for IPC action. Through this programme, WHO provides technical assistance for developing local IPC policies and guidelines, performs in-country assessments, convenes meetings focused on guideline development and provides ongoing support for health care providers. WHO also makes a global annual call to action for health workers though the SAVE LIVES: Clean Your Hands campaign held each May. This campaign seeks to educate health workers and patients on the importance of effective hand washing, the need for which has become more acute with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Schistosomiasis (Bilharzia),https://www.who.int/health-topics/schistosomiasis,"Schistosomiasis is a disease of poverty that leads to chronic
ill-health. Infection is acquired when people come into contact with
fresh water infested with the larval forms (cercariae) of parasitic
blood flukes, known as schistosomes. The microscopic adult worms live in
the veins draining the urinary tract and intestines. Most of the eggs
they lay are trapped in the tissues and the body’s reaction to them can
cause massive damage. Schistosomiasis affects almost 240 million people worldwide, and
more than 700 million people live in endemic areas. The infection is
prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical areas, in poor communities
without potable water and adequate sanitation. Urogenital
schistosomiasis is caused by Schistosoma haematobium and intestinal
schistosomiasis by any of the organisms S. guineensis, S. intercalatum, S. mansoni, S. japonicum , and S. mekongi . Several million people all over the world suffer from severe morbidity as a consequence of schistosomiasis. The WHO strategy on use of anthelminthic drugs now makes it possible to
control schistosomiasis in poor and marginalized communities, in
conjunction with interventions against lymphatic filariasis,
onchocerciasis and soil transmitted helminthiasis. In highly endemic
areas, severe morbidity due to schistosomiasis can be prevented by
regular treatment of at risk groups targeted based on community
diagnosis based on sentinel groups. Praziquantel has been safely
co-administered with albendazole and ivermectin, in areas where these
drugs have been used separately for preventive chemotherapy.         Symptoms of schistosomiasis are caused by the body’s reaction to the worms' eggs. Intestinal schistosomiasis can result in abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and blood in the stool. Liver enlargement is common in advanced cases, and is frequently associated with an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity and hypertension of the abdominal blood vessels. In such cases there may also be enlargement of the spleen. The classic sign of urogenital schistosomiasis is haematuria (blood in urine). Fibrosis of the bladder and ureter, and kidney damage are sometimes diagnosed in advanced cases. Bladder cancer is another possible complication in the later stages. In women, urogenital schistosomiasis may present with genital lesions, vaginal bleeding, pain during sexual intercourse, and nodules in the vulva. In men, urogenital schistosomiasis can induce pathology of the seminal vesicles, prostate, and other organs. This disease may also have other long-term irreversible consequences, including infertility. The economic and health effects of schistosomiasis are considerable and the disease disables more than it kills. In children, schistosomiasis can cause anaemia, stunting and a reduced ability to learn, although the effects are usually reversible with treatment. Praziquantel is the recommended treatment against all forms of
schistosomiasis. It is effective, safe, and low-cost. Even though
re-infection may occur after treatment, the risk of developing severe
disease is diminished and even reversed when treatment is initiated and
repeated in childhood. Schistosomiasis control has been
successfully implemented over the past 40 years in several countries,
including Brazil, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Mauritius, Islamic Republic of
Iran, Oman, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Tunisia, etc. In Burundi,
Burkina Faso, Ghana, Niger, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, the United Republic of
Tanzania, and Yemen, it has been possible to scale-up schistosomiasis
treatment to the national level and have an impact on the disease in a
few years. An assessment of the status of transmission is required in
several countries. Over the past 10 years,
there has been scale-up of treatment campaigns in a number of
sub-Saharan countries, where most of those at risk live.                                                                    ",WHO
Heatwaves,https://www.who.int/health-topics/heatwaves,"Heatwaves, or heat and hot weather that can last for several days, can have a significant impact on society, including a rise in heat-related deaths. Heatwaves are among the most dangerous of natural hazards, but rarely receive adequate attention because their death tolls and destruction are not always immediately obvious. A study found that from 2000–2019 approximately 489 000 heat-related deaths occurred each year, including more than 70 000 who died during the 2003 heatwave in Europe. Population exposure to heat is increasing due to climate change. Globally, extreme temperature events are observed to be increasing in their frequency, duration, and magnitude. Between 2000 and 2016, the number of people exposed to heatwaves increased by around 125 million. While the effects of heat may be exacerbated in cities, due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect, the livelihoods and well-being of non-urban communities can also be severely disrupted during and after periods of unusually hot weather. Heatwaves can burden health and emergency services and also increase strain on water, energy and transportation resulting in power shortages or even blackouts. Food and livelihood security may also be strained if people lose their crops or livestock due to extreme heat.     The health impact of a heatwave depends on the intensity and duration of the temperature, the acclimatization and adaptation of the population, and the infrastructure and preparedness. Exposure to heat causes severe symptoms, such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke – a condition which causes faintness, as well as dry, warm skin, due to the inability of the body to control high temperatures. Other symptoms include swelling in the lower limbs, heat rash on the neck, cramps, headache, irritability, lethargy and weakness. Heat can cause severe dehydration, acute cerebrovascular accidents and contribute to thrombogenesis (blood clots). People with chronic diseases that take daily medications have a greater risk of complications and death during a heatwave, as do older people and children. Reactions to heat depends on each person’s ability to adapt and serious effects can appear suddenly. This is why it is important to pay attention to the alerts and recommendations of local authorities.        The magnitude of human costs from heatwaves can be reduced if adequate emergency prevention, preparedness, response and recovery measures are implemented in a sustainable and timely manner. WHO works with the health sector to strengthen governance, preparedness and response to heatwaves, by developing contingency plans that map the risks, vulnerable populations, available capacities and resources. These plans also include early warning systems and ensure vulnerable populations, such as those in health facilities, nursing homes and schools have adequate provision of cooling equipment. As the health cluster lead for global emergencies, WHO works with partners to respond to: ensure appropriate food supplementation; restore primary care services, like immunization, child and maternal health, and mental health; assemble mobile health teams and outreach; conduct epidemic surveillance, early warning and response; call for emergency funding to support health action.

Medical devices,https://www.who.int/health-topics/medical-devices,"Access to good quality, affordable, and appropriate health products is indispensable to advance universal health coverage, address health emergencies, and promote healthier populations. Without medical devices, common medical procedures – from bandaging a sprained ankle, to diagnosing HIV/AIDS, implanting an artificial hip or any surgical intervention – would not be possible. Medical devices are used in many diverse settings, for example, by laypersons at home, by paramedical staff and clinicians in remote clinics, by opticians and dentists and by health-care professionals in advanced medical facilities, for prevention and screening and in palliative care. Such health technologies are used to diagnose illness, to monitor treatments, to assist disabled people and to intervene and treat illnesses, both acute and chronic. Today, there are an estimated 2 million different kinds of medical devices on the world market, categorized into more than 7000 generic devices groups. A medical device can be any instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, appliance, implant, reagent for in vitro use, software, material or other similar or related article, intended by the manufacturer to be used, alone or in combination for a medical purpose.      Policies, strategies, and action plans for health technologies, specifically for medical devices, are required in any national health plan. Within the context of a robust health system they ensure access to safe, effective, and high-quality medical devices that prevent, diagnose, and treat disease and injury, and assist patients in their rehabilitation. WHO’s “Global Model Regulatory Framework for Medical Devices including in vitro diagnostic medical devices” supports Member States to develop and implement regulatory controls and regional guidelines for good manufacturing to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of medical devices available in their countries. The Organization also works with Member States and collaborating centres to develop guidelines and tools, including norms and standards on medical devices. Additionally, WHO supports Member States in establishing mechanisms to assess national needs for health technologies in particular medical devices and to assure their availability and use, particularly in low-resource settings. A web-based health technologies database serves as a clearing house and provides countries guidance on appropriate medical devices according to levels of care, setting, environment, and intended health intervention, tailored to the specific needs of country or region.

Hypertension,https://www.who.int/health-topics/hypertension,"Hypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure, is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure. Blood is carried from the heart to all parts of the body in the vessels. Each time the heart beats, it pumps blood into the vessels. Blood pressure is created by the force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels (arteries) as it is pumped by the heart. The higher the pressure, the harder the heart has to pump. Hypertension is a serious medical condition and can increase the risk of heart, brain, kidney and other diseases. It is a major cause of premature death worldwide, with upwards of 1 in 4 men and 1 in 5 women – over a billion people ­– having the condition. The burden of hypertension is felt disproportionately in low- and middle-income countries, where two thirds of cases are found, largely due to increased risk factors in those populations in recent decades.         Many people with hypertension do not notice symptoms and may be unaware there is a problem. Symptoms can include early morning headaches, nosebleeds, irregular heart rhythms, vision changes, and buzzing in the ears. More severe forms may exhibit fatigue, nausea, vomiting, confusion, anxiety, chest pain, and muscle tremors. If left untreated, hypertension can cause persistent chest pain (also called angina), heart attacks, heart failure, and an irregular heartbeat, which can lead to a sudden death. Hypertension can also cause strokes by blocking or bursting arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the brain, as well as kidney damage, which can lead to kidney failure. High blood pressure causes damage to the heart by hardening arteries and decreasing the flood of blood and oxygen to the heart. Detecting hypertension is done with a quick and painless test of blood pressure. This can be done at home, but a health professional can help assess any risks or associated conditions. Reducing modifiable risk factors is the best way to prevent hypertension and associated diseases of the heart, brain, kidney and other organs. These factors include unhealthy diets (excessive salt consumption, a diet high in saturated fat and trans fats, low intake of fruits and vegetables), physical inactivity, consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and being overweight or obese. Additionally, prolonged exposure to air pollution increases the risk of hypertension in adults. There are also non-modifiable risk factors, including a family history of hypertension, age over 65 years and co-existing diseases such as diabetes or kidney disease. Avoiding dietary and behavioural risk factors is doubly important for those with unmodifiable or hereditary risk factors. Hypertension can be managed by reducing and managing mental stress, regularly checking blood pressure and consulting with health professionals, treating high blood pressure and managing other medical conditions. Cessation of tobacco use and the harmful use of alcohol, as well as improvements in diet and exercise, can help reduce symptoms and risk factors from hypertension.

Infant nutrition,https://www.who.int/health-topics/infant-nutrition,"Proper infant nutrition is fundamental to a child’s continued health, from birth through adulthood. Correct feeding in the first three years of life is particularly important due to its role in lowering morbidity and mortality, reducing the risk of chronic disease throughout their life span, and promoting regular mental and physical development. Although every infant and child has the right to good nutrition under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in many countries less than a fourth of infants have access to the required dietary diversity and feeding frequency. Inappropriate feeding practices contribute up to a third of all cases of child malnutrition. This is compounded by the proliferation of processed foods like infant formula and products rich in salt, free sugars and trans fats. This causes an increase in poor diets, obesity and a marked reduction in the number of mothers breastfeeding their babies. Breastfeeding has been shown to be of critical importance to a child’s development, including increased IQ, school performance and higher income in adult life. WHO continues to work with Member States and partners to promote proper infant and child nutrition, including breastfeeding information campaigns and efforts to prevent malnutrition at the local, national, and international levels. Learn about Nutrition and Food Safety and COVID-19     Malnutrition affects over 2 billion people worldwide, and the burden is felt disproportionately by people in low- and middle-income countries. Infants and children are particularly vulnerable, with most deaths due to malnutrition occurring in children under 5 years of age. It is estimated that more than 144 million children under 5 are stunted (meaning too short for their age) and 47 million are wasted (too thin for their height). A further 38.3 million are overweight or obese. Undernutrition, which can occur alone or concurrently with obesity in what is called the double burden of malnutrition, is associated with 2.7 million child deaths each year, or 45% of all deaths in children. Malnutrition in the early years of life can have long-lasting impacts on physical and mental development, which in turn affect a person’s educational performance and later employment opportunities. The extent of this issue is such that it has a sizable effect on economic markers in some countries and is considered a major global health problem.                                  Reducing global malnutrition begins with a proper diet during pregnancy and correct breastfeeding of infants. WHO recommends breastfeeding babies exclusively for 6 months, with safe and complementary foods being added slowly until age two or beyond. This means babies should receive only breastmilk from the mother or wet nurse with no other liquids or solids, including water unless required (such as oral rehydration solutions or vitamin and mineral supplements). With proper breastfeeding, it is estimated that over 820 000 children’s lives could be saved each year, with marked improvements in other development markers throughout the child’s life. Currently, only about 40% of infants are exclusively breastfed. WHO works to implement the initiatives outlined in the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition 2016–2025 in collaboration with Member States and partners. The goals of the campaign include improving the nutritional status of the population in all areas, particularly in early life, by preventing and treating malnutrition among pregnant women and young children.

Ageing,https://www.who.int/health-topics/ageing,"Every person – in every country in the world – should have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life. Yet, the environments in which we live can favour health or be harmful to it. Environments are highly influential on our behaviour and our exposure to health risks (for example, air pollution or violence), our access to services (for example, health and social care) and the opportunities that ageing brings. The number and proportion of people aged 60 years and older in the population is increasing. In 2019, the number of people aged 60 years and older was 1 billion. This number will increase to 1.4 billion by 2030 and 2.1 billion by 2050. This increase is occurring at an unprecedented pace and will accelerate in coming decades, particularly in developing countries. This historically significant change in the global population requires adaptations to the way societies are structured across all sectors. For example, health and social care, transportation, housing and urban planning. Working to make the world more age-friendly is an essential and urgent part of our changing demographics. Older people and COVID-19     Ageing presents both challenges and opportunities. It will increase demand for primary health care and long-term care, require a larger and better trained workforce, intensify the need for physical and social environments to be made more age-friendly, and call for everyone in every sector to combat ageism. Yet, these investments can enable the many contributions of older people – whether it be within their family, to their local community (e.g., as volunteers or within the formal or informal workforce) or to society more broadly. Societies that adapt to this changing demographic and invest in healthy ageing can enable individuals to live both longer and healthier lives and for societies to reap the dividends. WHO works with Member States, UN agencies and diverse stakeholders from various sectors to foster healthy ageing in every country. Healthy ageing is defined as developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables well-being in older age. Functional ability is determined by the intrinsic capacity of an individual (i.e., an individual’s physical and mental capacities), the environment in which he or she lives (understood in the broadest sense and including physical, social and policy environments) and the interactions among them. WHO does this work in line with the Global strategy and action plan on ageing and health 2016–2020 and the related UN Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021–2030) in the following four action areas: change how we think, feel and act towards age      and ageing; ensure that communities foster the abilities      of older people; deliver person-centred integrated care and      primary health services responsive to older people; and provide access to long-term care for older      people who need it.

Alcohol,https://www.who.int/health-topics/alcohol,"Alcohol is a toxic and psychoactive substance with dependence producing properties. In many of today’s societies, alcoholic beverages are a routine part of the social landscape for many in the population. This is particularly true for those in social environments with high visibility and societal influence, nationally and internationally, where alcohol frequently accompanies socializing. In this context, it is easy to overlook or discount the health and social damage caused or contributed to by drinking. Alcohol consumption contributes to 2.6 million deaths each year globally as well as to the disabilities and poor health of millions of people. Overall, harmful use of alcohol is responsible for 4.7% of the global burden of disease. Harmful use of alcohol is accountable for 6,9 % and 2.0% of the global burden of disease for males and females respectively. Alcohol is the leading risk factor for premature mortality and disability among those aged 20 to 39 years, accounting for 13% of all deaths in this age group. Disadvantaged and especially vulnerable populations have higher rates of alcohol-related death and hospitalization.     Alcohol as an intoxicant affects a wide range of structures and processes in the central nervous system and increases the risk for intentional and unintentional injuries and adverse social consequences. Alcohol has considerable toxic effects on the digestive and cardiovascular systems. Alcoholic beverages are classified as carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and increase the risk of several cancer types. Alcohol as an immunosuppressant increases the risk of communicable diseases, including tuberculosis and HIV. Both the volume of lifetime alcohol use and a combination of context, frequency of alcohol consumption and amount consumed per occasion increase the risk of the wide range of health and social harms. The risks increase largely in a dose-dependent manner with the volume of alcohol consumed and with frequency of drinking, and exponentially with the amount consumed on a single occasion. Surrogate and illegally produced alcohols can bring an extra health risk from toxic contaminants. Since any alcohol use is associated with some short-term and long-term health risks, it is difficult to define universally applicable population-based thresholds for low-risk drinking.        WHO works with Member States and partners to prevent and reduce the harmful use of alcohol as a public health priority. The 2010 WHO Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol and the 2022 WHO Global action plan are the most comprehensive international alcohol policy documents, endorsed by WHO Member States, that provides guidance on reducing the harmful use of alcohol at all levels. WHO’s approach aligns with and furthers work towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically target 3.5 on substance abuse, including harmful use of alcohol, and target 3.4 on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and promoting mental health and well-being. WHO has identified that the most cost-effective actions to reduce the harmful use of alcohol include increasing taxes on alcoholic beverages, enforcing restrictions on exposure to alcohol advertising, and restrictions on the physical availability of retailed alcohol. In addition, enforcing drink driving countermeasures and securing access to screening, brief interventions, and treatment are effective and ethically sound interventions. The most cost-effective interventions are at the focus of WHO-led SAFER initiative aimed at providing support for Member States in reducing the harmful use of alcohol. WHO’s work provides special attention to reducing harm to people other than the drinker and to populations that are at particular risk from harmful use of alcohol, such as children, adolescents, women of child-bearing age, pregnant and breastfeeding women, indigenous people and other minority groups or groups with low socioeconomic status.

Human rights,https://www.who.int/health-topics/human-rights,"Health is a fundamental right of every human being. Health as a human right is recognized in the WHO Constitution (1948), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and many international and regional human rights treaties. All WHO Member States have ratified at least one treaty that recognizes the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. This means that countries have legal obligations, while acknowledging that time and resources are required to fully achieve them. Some immediate obligations for countries include the guarantees of non-discrimination and equal treatment in health. The right to health includes entitlements, such as the right to control one’s health, informed consent, bodily integrity, and participation in health-related decision-making. It also includes freedoms, like freedom from torture, ill-treatment and harmful practices. The right to health is closely related to and dependent on the realization of other human rights, including the rights to life, food, housing, work, education, privacy, access to information, freedom from torture and the freedoms of association, assembly and movement. It includes both nondiscriminatory access to quality, timely and appropriate health services and systems and to the underlying determinants of health.             WHO supports country efforts to integrate human rights into health systems, programmes and policies. To achieve this, WHO provides guidance on human rights in the context of health issues, such as HIV, maternal and child health, mental health and others. WHO also provides support to countries to strengthen national health systems to ensure that services are universally available, accessible, acceptable and of high quality. WHO's political leadership on the right to health focuses on supporting countries to review laws, policies and practices to ensure they support the right to health. WHO's human rights work aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To meet the SDGs, WHO produces and disseminates tools and guidance to identify who is being left behind and why, as well as guidance on social participation to ensure accountability. WHO also supports countries to use international and regional human rights accountability mechanisms to advance health related rights.                           A human rights-based approach (HRBA) aims to support sustainable development by addressing inequalities, discriminatory practices and unjust power relations that are often at the core of unequal outcomes. HRBA focuses on the groups of people who are most marginalized and discriminated against. The United Nations common understanding of a HRBA serves as a guiding framework. It has the following elements. Goal: All programmes, policies and technical assistance should further the realization of the right to health and other health-related human rights. Process: Human rights standards and principles – such as participation, accountability, equality and non-discrimination – are integrated into all stages of the health programming cycle, including assessment, priority setting, planning and design, implementation and monitoring and evaluation. Outcome: Institutions, processes and systems need to ensure that people are empowered to understand and claim their health-related rights. States are the primary duty bearers and must be supported to deliver on their human rights obligations. Non-State actors, like the private sector and non-governmental organizations, also have human rights obligations. Policy makers and parliamentarians must use their regulatory powers to ensure the respect, protection and fulfilment of health-related rights, health and safety standards and labour rights, among others.

Floods,https://www.who.int/health-topics/floods,"Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster and occur when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry. Floods are often caused by heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt or a storm surge from a tropical cyclone or tsunami in coastal areas. Floods can cause widespread devastation, resulting in loss of life and damages to personal property and critical public health infrastructure. Between 1998-2017, floods affected more than 2 billion people worldwide. People who live in floodplains or non-resistant buildings, or lack warning systems and awareness of flooding hazard, are most vulnerable to floods. There are 3 common types of floods: Flash floods are caused by rapid and excessive rainfall that raises water heights quickly, and rivers, streams, channels or roads may be overtaken. River floods are caused when consistent rain or snow melt forces a river to exceed capacity. Coastal floods are caused by storm surges associated with tropical cyclones and tsunami. Between 80-90% of all documented disasters from natural hazards during the past 10 years have resulted from floods, droughts, tropical cyclones, heat waves and severe storms. Floods are also increasing in frequency and intensity, and the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation is expected to continue to increase due to climate change.     Drowning accounts for 75% of deaths in flood disasters. Flood disasters are becoming more frequent and this trend is expected to continue. Drowning risks increase with floods particularly in low- and middle-income countries where people live in flood prone areas and the ability to warn, evacuate, or protect communities from floods is weak or only just developing. Deaths also result from physical trauma, heart attacks, electrocution, carbon monoxide poisoning or fire associated with flooding. Often, only immediate traumatic deaths from flooding are recorded. Floods can also have medium- and long-term health impacts, including: water- and vector-borne diseases, such as cholera, typhoid or malaria injuries, such as lacerations or punctures from evacuations and disaster cleanup chemical hazards mental health effects associated with emergency situations disrupted health systems, facilities and services, leaving communities without access to health care damaged basic infrastructure, such as food and water supplies, and safe shelter. The magnitude of the physical and human costs from floods can be reduced if adequate emergency prevention, preparedness, response and recovery measures are implemented in a sustainable and timely manner. WHO works with Member States to build resilient and proactive health systems that can anticipate the needs and challenges during emergencies so that they are more likely to reduce risks and respond effectively when needed. As the health cluster lead for global emergencies, WHO works with partners to respond to: ensure appropriate food supplementation restore primary care services, like immunization, child and maternal health, and mental health assemble mobile health teams and outreach conduct epidemic surveillance, early warning and response call for emergency funding to support health action.

Abuse of older people,https://www.who.int/health-topics/abuse-of-older-people,"The abuse of older people, also known as elder abuse, is an intentional act, or failure to act, by a caregiver or another person in a relationship involving an expectation of trust that causes harm to an adult 60 years and older. Around 1 in 6 people 60 years and older experienced some form of abuse in community settings during the past year. Rates in institutional settings, such as nursing homes and long-term care facilities, are higher still, with 2 in 3 staff reporting that they have committed abuse in the past year. Even if rates remain constant, the absolute number of older people experiencing abuse is predicted to increase as the global population of older people increases. Abuse of older people can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences, increased risk of nursing home placement, use of emergency services, hospitalization and premature death. Promising strategies to prevent and respond to abuse of older people include caregiver interventions, which provide services to relieve the burden of caregiving; money management programmes for older adults vulnerable to financial exploitation; helplines and emergency shelters; and multi-disciplinary teams, as the responses required often cut across many systems, including, for instance, criminal justice, health care, mental health care, adults protective services and long-term care.             On 15 June 2022, World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, WHO and partners published “ Tackling abuse of older people: five priorities for the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021–2030) ”. The United Nations Decade of Healthy Ageing 2021–2030 is a unique chance for a step change in the way abuse of older people is tackled.
    It offers an opportunity to address abuse of older people in a more concerted, sustained and coordinated way and to reduce the number of older people worldwide who experience abuse. This document outlines five priorities, arrived at through wide consultation,
    to prevent and respond to abuse of older people, which are: combatting ageism; generating more and better data on prevalence and risk and on protective factors; developing and scaling up cost–effective solutions for abuse of older people; making an investment case for addressing the issue; and raising funds for tackling abuse of older people. WHO’s response to abuse of older people will also be organized according to these five priorities. If governments, UN agencies and development organizations, civil society organizations, academic and research institutions and funders implement these
    priorities we can finally start to prevent abuse of older people globally and contribute to improving their health, well-being and dignity. Many strategies have been implemented to prevent abuse of older people, take action against it and mitigate its consequences. Interventions that have been implemented – mainly in high-income countries – to prevent abuse include: public and professional awareness campaigns screening (of potential victims and abusers) school-based intergenerational programmes caregiver support interventions (including      stress management and respite care) residential care policies to define and      improve standards of care caregiver training on dementia money management programmes multidisciplinary teams. Efforts to respond to and prevent further abuse include interventions such as: mandatory reporting of abuse to authorities self-help groups safe-houses and emergency shelters psychological programmes for abusers helplines to provide information and referrals caregiver support interventions.

Landslides,https://www.who.int/health-topics/landslides,"Landslides are more widespread than any other geological event, and can occur anywhere in the world. They occur when large masses of soil, rocks or debris move down a slope due to a natural phenomenon or human activity. Mudslides or debris flows are also a common type of fast-moving landslide. Landslides can accompany heavy rains or follow droughts, earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. Areas most vulnerable to landslides include: steep terrain, including areas at the bottom of canyons; land previously burned by wildfires; land that has been modified due to human activity, such as deforestation or construction; channels along a stream or river; any area were surface runoff is directed or land is heavily saturated. Between 1998-2017, landslides affected an estimated 4.8 million people and cause more than 18 000 deaths. Climate change and rising temperatures are expected to trigger more landslides, especially in mountainous areas with snow and ice. As permafrost melts, rocky slopes can become more unstable resulting in a landslide.     Landslides can cause high mortality and injuries from rapidly flowing water and debris. The most common cause of death in a landslide is trauma or suffocation by entrapment. Broken power, water, gas or sewage pipes can also result in injury or illness in the population affected, such as water-borne diseases, electrocution or lacerations from falling debris. People affected by landslides can also have short- and long-term mental health effects due to loss of family, property, livestock or crops. Landslides can also greatly impact the health system and essential services, such as water, electricity or communication lines. The magnitude of the physical and human costs from landslides can be reduced if adequate emergency prevention, preparedness, response and recovery measures are implemented in a sustainable and timely manner.

Sustainable development,https://www.who.int/health-topics/sustainable-development,"Sustainable development is a broad term to describe policies, projects and investments that provide benefits today without sacrificing environmental, social and personal health in the future. These policies are often described as green because they focus on limiting the impact of development on the environment. However, the benefits of sustainable development are also felt across a wide cross section of human health and well-being, including reductions in pollution- and environment-related disease, improved health outcomes and decreased stress. As the threats of climate change become increasingly important, win-win strategies for mitigation, health improvement and cost savings offer a range of advantages for various stakeholders. For example, greener health care operations can generate patient and worker health benefits while also saving energy, mitigating climate risks and creating long-term cost savings. The World Health Organization is committed to pursuing sustainable development in all its work to help protect the people of tomorrow from the health growing health risks of today.     Many sustainable development strategies can offer significant wins for health, climate and the environment, and the benefits can be seen almost immediately. For example, many health and development goals can be achieved simultaneously by tackling air pollution, which is responsible for an estimated 7 million premature deaths annually. Polluting emissions include powerful short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs)—particularly black carbon, ozone and methane—which are very harmful to health but have only brief atmospheric lifetimes. Transport policies and investments that favour clean public transport, along with walking and cycling, can have a dramatic impact on air quality. This can reduce multiple health risks at the same time, including stroke, heart attack, lung disease and some cancers. They can also reduce the estimated 1.25 million deaths annually from traffic injury, while also improving access to health services, particularly in densely populated areas. Sustainable development housing policies can further reduce emissions through considerations such as building siting and land use, choices of construction materials, design features and ventilation and energy.        WHO’s work is guided by the Sustainable Development Goals , particularly Goal 3: “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.” The Goals inform projects and policies across
    the Organization, including guidelines on housing, urban development, transportation systems and health care delivery. For example, the WHO Housing and health guidelines, first published in 2018, highlight the increasing impact of housing conditions on human health in light of urban growth, climate and demographic changes. The guidelines provide Member States, partners
    and the public with evidence-based recommendations relevant to inadequate living space (crowding), low and high indoor temperatures, injury hazards in the home, and accessibility of housing for people with functional impairments. The Urban Health Initiative (UHI) also focuses on ways for cities to enable good health by catalysing effective action on urban air pollution and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs)—saving lives by linking health, environment and sustainable
    development. WHO also collaborates with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) on the Breathe Life campaign, which aims to cut air pollution and reduce the 7 million premature deaths annually that it causes.                                                                 ",WHO
Health equity,https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-equity,"Equity is the absence of unfair, avoidable or remediable differences among groups of people, whether those groups are defined socially, economically, demographically, or geographically or by other dimensions of inequality (e.g. sex, gender, ethnicity,
    disability, or sexual orientation). Health is a fundamental human right. Health equity is achieved when everyone can attain their full potential for health and well-being. Health and health equity are determined by the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, play and age, as well as biological determinants.  Structural determinants (political, legal, and economic) with social norms and institutional
    processes shape the distribution of power and resources determined by the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, play and age. People’s living conditions are often made worse by discrimination, stereotyping, and prejudice based on sex, gender, age, race, ethnicity, or disability, among other factors. Discriminatory practices are often embedded in institutional and systems
    processes, leading to groups being under-represented in decision-making at all levels or underserved. Progressively realizing the right to health means systematically identifying and eliminating inequities resulting from differences in health and in overall living conditions.                      To improve health equity, evidence-informed action is needed: (1)  by the health sector to ensure high-quality and effective services are available, accessible and acceptable to everyone, everywhere when they need them; (2)  by health and or other sectors to act on the wider structural determinants of health to tackle the inequitable distribution of power and resources, and to improve daily living conditions; and (3) the health sector needs to take the lead in monitoring health inequities through monitoring health outcomes and health service delivery – as well as working with other sectors to monitor people’s living conditions. Key examples include: redesigning health systems for equity e.g. pooling financial resources to enhance redistributive capacity and to progressively cover one billion additional people by 2023; prioritising the Primary Health Care approach e.g. investment of 1% of GDP in PHC; tackling structural determinants such as sexism, racism, ageism, classism and ablism; addressing harmful gender norms and gender inequalities in health policies/services/programmes and having more women in leadership positions and decision-making processes; protecting and increasing investment in health and other social sectors (through Universal Health Coverage (UHC), education and broader social protection) e.g. ensuring policies for decent work and employment conditions for all; ensuring equitable services and infrastructure in both urban and rural areas to ensure everyone can lead healthy lives; and continuing to monitor health inequalities and the impact of action.                   Knowledge, monitoring, and analysis make up the backbone of actions needed to achieve equity. Monitoring health inequality must be central to a country’s health information system. This begins with the collection, analysis and reporting of data disaggregated by age, sex, education, income, disability and other factors. Qualitative data is also essential to understand the how and why of inequities. Data must also be linked with information on other determinants such as education to better understand cause-and-effect relationships i.e. how these other determinants contribute to health inequities. Part of inequality monitoring includes addressing gaps created by gender and other biases in how data has been previously collected, analysed and reported. Equity, gender and rights-based assessment approaches and tools (including participatory approaches) should be used to systematically collect, collate, and analyze the evidence on health inequalities. This includes the health equity impacts of action by health and other sectors, for example reviewing specific aspects of the health system (e.g. Primary Health Care (PHC)/financing/health workforce) or of specific programmes (e.g. adolescent health/neglected tropical diseases/urban health). The findings need to be used to design responses for improved equity and ongoing monitoring of health inequalities.                                     ",WHO
Genomics,https://www.who.int/health-topics/genomics,"Genomics is the study of the complete set of genes (the genome) of organisms, of the way genes work, interact with each other and with the environment. Genomics incorporates elements of genetics, but is concerned with the characterization of all genes of an organism, rather than individual genes. The field is multidisciplinary, and uses a combination of laboratory and bioinformatic techniques to investigate genomes’ structure, function, how they have evolved and how they can be edited. Landmark achievements in the early 2000s, culminating with the publication of the first reference human genome, have transformed scientific discovery of diseases and launched a powerful era in genetic medicine. Recent breakthroughs include: advances in the field of pharmacogenomics, where genomic information is used to study individual responses to drugs and enable the development of targeted therapies; the publication of the first human 'pangenome', representing the genetic diversity of the species; and the development of genome editing approaches, including by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Collectively, these innovations have reshaped the understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases, of genotype–phenotype relationships, the way health information is generated and how knowledge is translated in novel medicine and public health practice.      Compared to high-income countries, low- and middle-income countries are often disproportionately disadvantaged in the advancement of, and access to, genomics technologies and their applications. WHO is implementing a programme of activities to promote equitable and fair access to genomics technologies for the benefit of people worldwide. Following recommended actions identified by the WHO Science Council in its report ‘ Accelerating access to genomics for global health: promotion, implementation, collaboration, and ethical, legal, and social issues: a report of the WHO Science Council’ (2022), the programme of work is articulated across four themes: ● Promotion: Advocacy is needed to persuade governments, commercial and non-commercial organizations, academic institutions, and others, of the medical, scientific, and economic benefits of genomic technologies and to promote affordable access to genomic technologies globally. ● Implementation : Overcoming obstacles to implementation will require local planning, financing, training of essential personnel, and the affordable provision of instruments, materials, and computational infrastructure. ● Collaboration : Government ministries, funding agencies, healthcare and scientific organizations in academia and industry should collaborate to establish plans on how to use genomics, build and expand technical capacity, if appropriate through regional programmes. ● Ethical, legal and social issues : Effective oversight – coupled with national and international rules and standards – is key to promoting ethical, legal, equitable use and responsible sharing of information obtained with genomic methods.                                    Genomics is evolving rapidly, and its potential impact for the future of human health cannot yet be known. Human genomics knowledge and technologies provide new ways to prevent and manage many diseases, and opportunities to achieve global public health goals. Genomic knowledge of other organisms contributes to the understanding of human health and diseases, the interconnectedness across species, and is thus a vital component of the One Health approach. Some applications of genomics: medical applications in risk assessment, diagnosis, treatment selection, disease monitoring and drug development; applications of pathogen genomics in the identification of etiological agents, surveillance of infections and investigation of their transmission within communities; animal and plant genomics applications to catalogue genetic biodiversity, identify phenotypic and functional genetic traits, and select and engineer specific traits.

"Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine",https://www.who.int/health-topics/traditional-complementary-and-integrative-medicine,"Traditional medicine Traditional medicine has a long history. It is the sum total of the knowledge, skill, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness. Complementary medicine The terms “complementary medicine” or “alternative medicine” refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country’s own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health-care system. They are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries. Herbal medicines Herbal medicines include herbs, herbal materials, herbal preparations and finished herbal products, that contain as active ingredients parts of plants, or other plant materials, or combinations.     The WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014–2023 was developed and launched in response to the World Health Assembly resolution on traditional medicine (WHA62.13). The strategy aims to support Member States in developing proactive policies and implementing action plans that will strengthen the role traditional medicine plays in keeping populations healthy. Addressing the challenges, responding to the needs identified by Member States and building on the work done under the WHO traditional medicine strategy: 2002–2005, the updated strategy for the period 2014–2023 devotes more attention than its predecessor to prioritizing health services and systems, including traditional and complementary medicine products, practices and practitioners. The strategic objectives are: To build the knowledge base for active management of T&CM through appropriate national policies; To strengthen the quality assurance, safety, proper use and effectiveness of T&CM by regulating products, practices and practitioners; To promote universal health coverage by integrating T&CM services into health care service delivery and self-health care.

Nipah virus infection,https://www.who.int/health-topics/nipah-virus-infection,"Nipah virus infection is a
    zoonotic illness that is transmitted to people from animals, and can also be
    transmitted through contaminated food or directly from person-to-person. In
    infected people, it causes a range of illnesses from asymptomatic (subclinical)
    infection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis. The virus can
    also cause severe disease in animals such as pigs, resulting in significant
    economic losses for farmers. Although Nipah virus has
    caused only a few known outbreaks in Asia, it infects a wide range of animals
    and causes severe disease and death in people. During the first
    recognized outbreak in Malaysia, which also affected Singapore, most human
    infections resulted from direct contact with sick pigs or their contaminated
    tissues. Transmission is thought to have occurred via unprotected exposure to
    secretions from the pigs, or unprotected contact with the tissue of a sick
    animal. In subsequent outbreaks in Bangladesh and India, consumption of fruits or fruit
    products (such as raw date palm juice) contaminated with urine or saliva from
    infected fruit bats was the most likely source of infection. Human-to-human
 transmission of Nipah virus has also been reported among family and care givers
    of infected patients.         Human infections range from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory infection, seizures and fatal encephalitis. Infected people initially develop symptoms that include fever, headaches, myalgia, vomiting and sore throat. This can be followed by dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness, and neurological signs that indicate acute encephalitis. Some people can also experience atypical pneumonia and severe respiratory problems, including acute respiratory distress. Encephalitis and seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to coma within 24 to 48 hours. The incubation period is from 4 to 14 days but an incubation period as long  as 45 days has been reported. Most people make a full recovery, although some are left with residual neurological conditions after acute encephalitis. Some cases of relapse have been reported. The case fatality rate of Nipah virus infection is estimated at 40–75% but can vary by outbreak depending on surveillance and clinical management in affected areas. There are currently no drugs or vaccines that specifically target Nipah virus infection. WHO has identified Nipah as a priority disease for the WHO Research and Development Blueprint. Intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications.                                                                    ",WHO
Influenza (avian and other zoonotic),https://www.who.int/health-topics/influenza-avian-and-other-zoonotic,"Animal influenza viruses are distinct from human seasonal influenza viruses and do not easily transmit between humans. However, zoonotic influenza viruses - animal influenza viruses that may occasionally infect humans through direct or indirect contact - can cause disease in humans ranging from a mild illness to death. Birds are the natural hosts for avian influenza viruses . After an outbreak of A(H5N1) virus in 1997 in poultry in Hong Kong SAR, China, since 2003, this avian and other influenza viruses have spread from Asia to Europe and Africa. In 2013, human infections with the influenza A(H7N9) virus were reported in China. Most swine influenza viruses do not cause disease in humans, but some countries have reported cases of human infection from certain swine influenza viruses. Close proximity to infected pigs or visiting locations where pigs are exhibited has been reported for most human cases, but some limited human-to-human transmission has occurred. Just like birds and pigs, other animals such as horses and dogs, can be infected with their own influenza viruses (canine influenza viruses, equine influenza viruses, etc.).         Avian, swine and other zoonotic influenza infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock and even death. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea has been reported more frequently in A(H5N1) infection. Conjunctivitis has also been reported in influenza A(H7). Disease features such as the incubation period, severity of symptoms and clinical outcome varies by the virus causing infection but mainly manifests with respiratory symptoms. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs , notably neuraminidase inhibitor (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve prospects of survival, however ongoing clinical studies are needed. Emergence of oseltamivir resistance has been reported.                                                                    ",WHO
Nursing and midwifery,https://www.who.int/health-topics/nursing,"Nursing encompasses autonomous and collaborative care of individuals of all ages, families, groups and communities, sick or well and in all settings. It includes the promotion of health, the prevention of illness, and the care of ill, disabled and dying people. Nurses play a critical role in health care and are often the unsung heroes in health care facilities and emergency response. They are often the first to detect health emergencies and work on the front lines of disease prevention and the delivery of primary health care, including promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. In many countries, nurses make up half of all health care professionals and have a vital role in how health actions are organized and applied, both at the front-line and managerial levels.  They are often the first and sometimes only health professional a patient will see and the quality of their initial assessment and subsequent care is vital to strong health outcomes.     Despite the critical role they play in health care, there is a shortage of nurses worldwide that is expected to rise as the population grows. Initiatives to expand health care services, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, are succeeding in providing access to previously underserved communities, which furthers the need for trained nurses. Every country needs a competent, motivated, well-distributed and supported health workforce as part of the global drive for universal health coverage, and nurses are central to these efforts. Nurses and midwives account for nearly 50% of the global health workforce. However, they also represent 50% of the global shortage of health workers, which is estimated at 4 million. Since in most countries nurses and midwives form the bulk
    of the clinical health workforce, developing and strengthening human resources for health means recognizing that nursing and midwifery services play a vital role in improving health service delivery. Nursing also represents a significant share of
    the female workforce; globally, 70% of health and social workers are women. Achieving the goal of health care for all will require huge efforts to reduce the shortage of health workers around the world.        WHO recognizes the vital role that nurses play in primary
    health care delivery worldwide – including research, disease prevention,
    treating the injured, palliative care and more – which is represented through
    several World Health Assembly resolutions. These documents demonstrate the
    importance WHO Member States attach to nursing and midwifery services as a
    means of achieving better health for all communities. Nursing and Midwifery at WHO is led by the Chief Nursing Officer (CNO), Dr Amelia Latu Afuhaamango Tuipulotu, from the Kingdom of Tonga. She was appointed to the role in December 2022, taking over from Elizabeth Iro, the first Chief Nursing Officer at WHO, who held the position from 2017-2022. A key role of the Office is to provide leadership to nurses and midwives worldwide. Through the Department of Human Resources for Health (HRH), WHO works on many fronts to promote the role of nurses in health care delivery and expand the global health work force. The Department aims to facilitate the integration of nursing and midwifery services into other WHO programmes and provide evidence-based information on the global health workforce to assist countries and partners in collaborate efforts. WHO also supports technical efforts for capacity building at both the policy level and through in-country programmes, and works to forge networks and effective partnerships to help meet the global need for health care workers.

International Health Regulations,https://www.who.int/health-topics/international-health-regulations,"While disease outbreaks and other acute public health risks are often unpredictable and require a range of responses, the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) provide an overarching legal framework that defines countries’ rights and obligations in handling  public health events and emergencies that have the potential to cross borders. The IHR are an instrument of international law that is legally-binding on 196 countries, including the 194 WHO Member States. The IHR  grew out of the response to  deadly epidemics that once overran Europe. They create rights and obligations for countries, including the requirement to report public health events. The Regulations also  outline the criteria to determine whether or not a particular event constitutes a  “public health emergency of international concern”. At the same time, the IHR require countries to designate a National IHR Focal Point for communications with WHO, to establish and maintain core capacities for surveillance and response, including at designated points of entry. Additional provisions address the areas of  international travel and transport such as the health documents required for international traffic. Finally, the IHR introduce important safeguards to protect the rights of travellers and other persons in relation to the treatment of personal data, informed consent and non-discrimination in the application of health measures under the Regulations.                                    To support countries in strengthening and maintaining their capacities for ensuring rapid detection, verification and response to public health risks, WHO develops and provides tools, guidance and training. WHO’s support focuses on the priority needs identified by the WHO Regional and Country Offices, in order to help each country meet its IHR commitment. This includes: designating WHO IHR Contact Points at the headquarters or the regional level; conducting global public health surveillance and assessment of significant public health events; disseminating public health information to Member States; offering technical assistance to Member States; supporting Member States in their efforts to assess their existing national public health structures and capacities for surveillance and response, including at designated points of entry; monitoring the implementation of IHR (2005) and updating guidelines; and if required, determining whether or not a particular event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), with advice from external experts. If a PHEIC is declared, WHO develops and recommends the critical health measures for implementation by Member States during such an emergency.       The responsibility for implementing the IHR rests upon all States Parties that are bound by the Regulations and on WHO. Governments  are responsible, including all of their sectors, ministries, levels, officials and personnel for implementing IHR at the national level. WHO plays the coordinating role in IHR implementation and, together with its partners, helps countries to build capacities. The IHR require that all countries have the ability to do the following: Detect: Make sure surveillance systems can detect acute public health events  in timely matter Assess and report: Use the decision instrument in Annex 2 of the IHR to assess public health event and report to WHO through their National IHR Focal Point those that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern Respond: Respond to public health risks and emergencies The goal of country implementation is to limit the spread of health risks to neighbouring countries and to prevent unwarranted travel and trade restrictions.

Syphilis,https://www.who.int/health-topics/syphilis,"Syphilis is a bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Treponema pallidum which results in substantial morbidity and mortality, and it is curable. Syphilis is transmitted through sexual contact with the infectious lesions, via blood transfusion or from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Mother-to-child transmission of syphilis is usually devastating to the fetus in cases that were not detected or treated sufficiently early in pregnancy . Maternal syphilis, when untreated, treated late or not treated with penicillin, results in adverse birth outcomes (ABOs) estimated in 50−80% of cases, depending on the stage of syphilis. These ABOs are often severe and include stillbirth (most commonly), neonatal death, prematurity, low birth weight, and congenitally infected infants. Syphilis can be prevented through safer sex practices including the correct and consistent use of condoms. Many people with syphilis do not have any symptoms or have only minor symptoms that go unnoticed. Identifying infection through laboratory tests and treatment of positive cases will prevent further transmission and adverse pregnancy outcomes including congenital syphilis. Screening can be done using rapid tests that can provide results in less than 20 minutes, allowing for immediate treatment. When untreated, syphilis lasts many years and goes through different stages. Treatment for syphilis is done with injectable penicillin benzathine, with 1 to 3 doses depending on the stage of the disease. Only penicillin can prevent congenital syphilis. Treatment with penicillin has been hampered by periodic and prolonged shortages of benzathine penicillin in numerous countries, including high-, low- and middle-income countries.         Many people with syphilis do not present symptoms or do not perceive them. Untreated, syphilis lasts many years and is characterized into different stages. Sexual transmission typically occurs during early stages, i.e., up to 2 years after infection. During the initial phase (primary syphilis), which lasts on average 21 days, a solitary, painless, usually hard and round sore (chancre) appears at the site of inoculation (contact), often in the vagina, penis or anus (but it may also be extra-genital) and may go unnoticed. The chancre heals with or without treatment within 3 to 10 weeks. If untreated, the disease progresses to the secondary stage. Secondary syphilis is characterized by a rash that can vary widely and mimic other infectious or non-infectious conditions, but characteristically affects the palms and soles. The rash is non-itchy and can be minimal enough to be overlooked. In warm and moist areas of the body, such as the anus and labia, large white or grey raised lesions may develop at the location of the primary chancre (condyloma lata). The symptoms and signs of secondary syphilis spontaneously resolve, even without treatment. Without treatment, the latent stage starts. Latent syphilis presents no clinical symptoms or signs and the treatment is different from the early phase. After years or decades without treatment, neurological and cardiovascular diseases among others may occur. Syphilis diagnosis is based on the person’s history, physical examination, laboratory testing and sometimes radiology, as symptoms are not common or noticeable. Identifying asymptomatic infection through laboratory tests and treatment of positive cases will prevent further transmission and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including congenital syphilis. Laboratory tests for syphilis include direct detection of T. pallidum or indirect methods such as serology. Rapid screening and diagnostic tests are also available and can provide results in less than 20 minutes, facilitating immediate treatment initiation. WHO recommends syphilis to be treated with injectable penicillin (benzathine penicillin G) with 1 or 3 doses, depending on the stage of the disease. WHO has detailed treatment guidelines for syphilis , and one specifically for the screening and treatment of syphilis in pregnancy . Congenital syphilis There are currently no diagnostic tests for congenital syphilis . All live or stillborn infants of women with syphilis should be examined for evidence of congenital syphilis. Live-born infants should be examined and tested at birth to define treatment requirement. When indicated, also at monthly intervals for 3 months until the infant’s serology are, and remain, negative, as maternal antibodies can be passively transmitted to the baby during pregnancy.

Drugs (psychoactive),https://www.who.int/health-topics/drugs-psychoactive,"Psychoactive drugs are substances that, when taken in or administered into one's system, affect mental processes, e.g. perception, consciousness, cognition or mood and emotions. Psychoactive drugs belong to a broader category of psychoactive substances
        that include also alcohol and nicotine.  “Psychoactive” does not necessarily imply dependence-producing, and in common parlance, the term is often left unstated, as in “drug use”, “substance use” or “substance
        abuse”. Production, distribution, sale or non-medical use of many psychoactive drugs is either controlled or prohibited outside legally sanctioned channels by law. Psychoactive drugs have different degrees of restriction of availability, depending on their
    risks to health and therapeutic usefulness, and classified according to a hierarchy of schedules at both national and international levels. At the international level, there are international drug conventions concerned with the control of production
    and distribution of psychoactive drugs: the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, amended by a 1972 Protocol; the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances; the 1988 Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.     The use of psychoactive drugs without medical supervision is associated with significant health risks and can lead to the development of drug use disorders. Drug use disorders, particularly when untreated, increase morbidity and mortality risks for individuals, can trigger substantial suffering and lead to impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Drug use disorders are associated with significant costs to society due to lost productivity, premature mortality, increased health care expenditure, and costs related to criminal justice, social welfare, and other social consequences. About 296 million people aged 15-64 had used psychoactive drugs in 2021 and about 39.5 million people are estimated to be affected by drug use disorders (harmful pattern of drug use or drug dependence). It is estimated that about 0.6 million death annually are attributable to drug use with about 420 000 male and 160 000 female deaths. More than 36 million years of healthy life loss (DALY) were attributable to drug use in 2019. It is estimated that worldwide there are almost 14.8 million people who inject drugs, of whom 15.2% live with HIV and 38.8% - with hepatitis C.        Since its creation, WHO has played an important role within the UN system in addressing the world drug problem. WHO activities to counter the world drug problem can be presented under the following main dimensions: prevention of drug use and reduction of vulnerability and risks; treatment and care of people with drug use disorders; prevention and management of the harms associated with drug use; access to controlled medicines; and monitoring and evaluation. Target 3.5 of UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 sets out a commitment by governments to strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse. Several other targets are also of particular relevance to drug policy-related health issues, especially target 3.3, referring to ending the AIDS epidemic and combating viral hepatitis; target 3.4, on preventing and treating noncommunicable diseases and promoting mental health; target 3.8, on achieving universal health coverage; and target 3.b, with its reference to providing access to affordable essential medicines. In April 2016, the thirtieth Special Session of the UN General Assembly (UNGASS) reviewed the progress in the implementation of the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation Towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem and assessed the achievements and challenges. In resolution S-30/1, the General Assembly adopted the outcome document of the special session on the world drug problem entitled “Our joint commitment to effectively addressing and countering the world drug problem”. The UNGASS marked a shift in the overall drug policy discourse to highlight the public health and human rights dimensions of the world drug problem and to achieve a better balance between supply reduction and public health measures.

Addictive behaviour,https://www.who.int/health-topics/addictive-behaviour,"Many people around the world are engaged in (video) gaming and gambling behaviours ,which are recognized as addictive behaviours, but usually do not result in any significant health consequences. However, a small proportion of people engaged in such behaviours may develop disorders due to addictive behaviours associated with functional impairment or distress. Video gaming is highly prevalent in modern culture, particularly among young people, and a healthy hobby for most users. However, in recent years there has been increasing global recognition among public health professionals and academics that particular patterns of video gaming may lead to marked impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and psychological distress for a significant minority of players. People who partake in gaming should be alert to the amount of time they spend on gaming activities, particularly when it is to the exclusion of other daily activities, as well as to any changes in their physical or psychological health and social functioning that could be attributed to their pattern of gaming behaviour. Gambling in many countries and jurisdictions is considered a form of entertainment, characterized by betting/wagering mechanics and monetization features. Like gaming, repetitive gambling behaviour can potentially lead to gambling disorder associated with distress or impairment. In recent years, there has been an increasing convergence between gaming and gambling on various platforms, significantly aided by the Internet. This convergence may give rise to migration from games to gambling and co- occurrence of the two disorders.                                            Use of the Internet, computers, smartphones and other electronic devices has dramatically increased over recent decades, and this increase is associated not only with clear and tremendous benefits to the users and societies, but also with documented cases of excessive use which often has negative health consequences. Health concerns associated with gaming behaviour are not limited to gaming disorder, but also include other aspects of health such as insufficient physical activity, unhealthy diet, problems with eyesight or hearing, musculoskeletal problems, sleep deprivation, and associated health conditions such as depression and venous thromboembolism. Prevalence estimates of gaming disorder vary considerably between countries and jurisdictions, largely due to the lack of a standardized assessment instrument, and prevalence of ""problem gaming"" which is a proxy measure for prevalence of “gaming disorder” varies in populations from 1.3 to 9.9%. Past-year prevalence of “problem gambling” which is a proxy measure for prevalence of gambling disorder among adults varies between 0.1% and 5.8%. Harms caused by the gambling are significant. For example, studies at a national level from Oceanian countries indicate that potential harms due to gambling are comparable to the harms due to depression and alcohol use disorders. Harms negatively impact the gamers/gamblers themselves as well as their families and community. Further international research activities - particularly in the case of gaming disorder - are imperative in order to yield a comprehensive picture of past and current problems, generate prevalence estimates, inform prevention and treatment planning and to facilitate comparisons. Psychometrically sound instruments based on reliable diagnostic criteria must be developed for this purpose. Disorders due to addictive behaviours are recognizable and clinically significant syndromes associated with distress or interference with personal functions that develop as a result of repetitive, rewarding behaviours other than the use of dependence-producing substances. Gambling disorder has long been included in formal classification systems and epidemiological surveys, but Gaming disorder was introduced as a new condition in the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) endorsed by the 72nd World Health Assembly (WHA72) in 2019. Based on similarities in symptomatology, epidemiology and neurobiology, gaming disorder and gambling disorder are categorized as disorders due to addictive behaviors in ICD-11.

Self-care for health and well-being,https://www.who.int/health-topics/self-care,"Self-care is the ability of individuals, families and communities to promote health, prevent disease, maintain health, and cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a health worker. Currently 3.6 billion people – half of the world – lack access to essential health services. WHO recommends self-care interventions for every country and economic setting, as a critical path to reach universal health coverage, promote
        health, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable. Self-care recognises individuals as active agents in managing their own health care, in areas including health promotion; disease prevention and control; self-medication; providing care to dependent persons, and rehabilitation, including palliative
        care. Self-care interventions are evidence-based, quality tools that support self-care. They include medicines, counselling, diagnostics and/or digital technologies which can be accessed fully or partially outside of formal health services. Depending on
        the intervention, they can be used with or without the direct supervision of health workers. Self-care interventions can: empower individuals and communities to manage their health and well-being strengthen national institutions with efficient use of domestic resources for health improve primary healthcare (PHC) and contribute to achieving UHC                                              A people-centred approach Self-care interventions support the needs and rights of individuals through a people-centred approach that is grounded in human rights and gender equality. This is a holistic approach to the health and well-being of each person, taking account of their circumstances, needs and desires across a lifetime, as well as the environment in which they live. Self-care is the power of individuals to prevent and treat diseases themselves, in the context of a safe and supportive enabling environment. It does not replace the health care system, but instead provides additional choices and options for health care. Available, accessible, affordable, acceptable and good quality self-care interventions are core components of promoting and protecting people’s right to health. Self-care interventions can improve the efficiency of health service delivery, access and coverage. This requires supportive laws and policies, health financing, regulated quality products and interventions, and education which promotes the participation of individuals, as well as privacy and confidentiality. Human rights considerations help to reduce violence, coercion, stigma and discrimination by improving each person’s exercise of their right to health, information, and independent decision-making. Pandemics and humanitarian crises In situations where existing health systems are stretched, there is often an unprecedented demand on individuals and communities to manage their health. Innovative strategies that go beyond the conventional health sector response is urgently needed given that: a record 274 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance and protection and disease outbreaks are a constant global threat at least 400 million people worldwide lack access to the most essential health services. 1 in 5 of the world’s population are now living in humanitarian crises, in which health systems are challenged to deliver essential services. Self-care interventions can provide valuable, additional options to the usual health facility- or health worker-based services, as part of a supportive health system. This is particularly relevant during a pandemic like COVID-19, when self-isolation and physical distancing measures make it more difficult for people to access their normal health care services and medications and national health systems can be disrupted. WHO includes self-care interventions as priority actions in operational guidance on maintaining essential health services for the COVID-19 context.                               ",WHO
Female genital mutilation,https://www.who.int/health-topics/female-genital-mutilation,"Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a traditional harmful practice that involves the partial or total removal of external female genitalia or other injury to female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It is estimated that more than 230 million girls and women alive today have undergone female genital mutilation in the countries where the practice is concentrated. In addition, every year more than 4 million girls are estimated to be at risk of undergoing female genital mutilation, the majority of whom are cut before they turn 15 years old. FGM has no health benefits. It can lead to immediate health risks, as well as long-term complications to women’s physical, mental and sexual health and well-being. The practice is recognized internationally as a violation of human rights of girls and women and as an extreme form of gender discrimination, reflecting deep-rooted inequality between the sexes. As it is practiced on young girls without consent, it is a violation of the rights of children. FGM also violates a person's rights to health, security and physical integrity, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death. As part of the Sustainable Development Goals, the global community has set a target to abandon the practice of female genital mutilation by the year 2030. While some countries are on track to achieve this target, progress needs to be greatly accelerated in many countries to achieve abandonment goals.             WHO is strongly opposed to health professionals performing FGM and urges all health workers to uphold the medical code of ethics to “do no harm”. Medicalization of FGM normalizes and condones the practice and hinders long term efforts for abandoning this grave violation of the human rights of women and girls. WHO recognizes the important role that health care personnel play in supporting and improving the health and well-being of girls and women living with FGM. Moreover, WHO acknowledges the unique position that midwives and nurses may have to influence and change attitudes towards FGM amongst their patients because of their close contact with practicing communities and since they provide the majority of health care in primary health care settings. WHO has developed a training package to help empower health providers by strengthening their knowledge about the practice, so that they in turn can act as influential agents for change within clinical settings as well in their communities and families. WHO uses a public health approach to FGM and works to ensure that girls and women living with FGM receive quality prevention and care services, by developing evidence-based guidance and resources for training and policy; supporting countries to adapt and implement them; generating evidence on causes, consequences, and costs of FGM and on what works to end the practice; and developing advocacy tools to support efforts to prevent FGM.        While the exact number of girls and women worldwide who have undergone female genital mutilation remains unknown, at least 230 million girls and women alive today have been subjected to the practice, according to data from the 31 countries where population level data exist. The practice is mainly concentrated in western, eastern, and north-eastern regions of Africa, as well as in some countries in the Middle East and Asia. With growing migration, there has been an increase in the number of girls and women in Europe, Australia and North America who have either undergone female genital mutilation or who may be at risk of being subjected to the practice. FGM is therefore a global concern. While there has been an overall decline in the prevalence of FGM over the last three decades in the younger age groups, not all countries have made progress and the pace of decline has been uneven. Current progress is insufficient to keep up with increasing population growth. If trends continue, the number of girls and women undergoing FGM will rise significantly in the next 15 years. In addition, some health workers themselves are performing FGM, impeding progress in the road to FGM abandonment                                                         ",WHO
Human genome editing,https://www.who.int/health-topics/human-genome-editing,"Genome editing is a method for making specific changes to the DNA of a cell or organism. It can be used to add, remove or alter DNA in the genome. Human genome editing technologies can be used on somatic cells (non-heritable), germline cells (not for reproduction) and germline cells (for reproduction). Application of somatic human genome editing has already been undertaken, including in vivo editing, to address HIV and sickle-cell disease, for example. Although somatic human genome editing is well established and acceptable for treatments in some scientifically advanced countries with regulations in place, challenges remain. These include the need to develop inclusive genome editing innovations that take note of the diversity of the human population and human experience. Other challenges are associated with rogue clinics, medical travel, as well as the reporting of illegal, unregistered, unethical or unsafe research and other activities including the offer of unproven so-called therapeutic interventions. Heritable human genome editing refers to editing of nuclear DNA in a way that may be heritable across generations. Heritable human genome editing is the subject of intense debate over its possible consequences for offspring and for society in general. They may pose greater safety and ethical issues than somatic human genome editing.     The recent application of tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9, to edit the human genome with the intention to treating or preventing disease and the gaps in our scientific understanding raise ethical issues that have highlighted the need for robust oversight in this area. Current, potential and speculative human genome editing research will go beyond national borders, as will possible societal effects. This applies equally to somatic, germline and heritable human genome editing, although the latter is generally considered to be of greater ethical concern. Therefore, governance for this technology is needed at national and transnational levels. Some of the necessary governance structures and processes already exist. These may need to be reinforced or amended; where such structures and processes are lacking, gaps need to be filled. Application of heritable human genome editing is likely to be a much more limited activity in the coming years. To help ensure heritable human genome editing does not proceed prematurely to clinical trials, the WHO Expert Advisory Committee recommended, and the WHO Director-General subsequently made, a policy statement in July 2019 clarifying that “it would be irresponsible at this time for anyone to proceed with clinical applications of human germline genome editing.” In December 2018, WHO established a global, multi-disciplinary Expert Advisory Committee to examine the scientific, ethical, social and legal challenges associated with human genome editing (somatic, that is, non-heritable; germline, involving in vitro
    studies on early embryos, gametes or their precursors; and heritable, where embryos subject to genome editing are used to establish pregnancies and create individuals who could pass on the edit to their offspring). The Committee was tasked to advise and make recommendations on appropriate institutional, national, regional and global governance mechanisms for human genome editing. During its work, the Committee reviewed the current literature on human genome editing
    research and its applications, considered existing proposals for governance and relevant ongoing initiatives, and gathered information on a range of topics relating to the different uses of this technology. The Committee consulted widely and built
    on existing initiatives to develop a governance framework and recommendations on the governance and oversight of human genome editing. In July 2021, the Committee published a governance framework for human genome editing and recommendations on human genome editing. Additional outputs of the Committee include a global registry on human genome editing , a policy statement by the Director-General on germline human genome editing and the reports of the Committee’s work.

Respiratory syncytial virus,https://www.who.int/health-topics/respiratory-syncytial-virus,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common virus that causes infections of the upper and lower respiratory airways (including the nose, sinuses and lungs). Discovered in 1956, RSV is a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus that belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae . It is classified into 2 subgroups, RSV-A and RSV-B. Both subgroups tend to co-circulate during each season and both can cause severe disease. RSV is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory infections and associated hospitalizations in infants and children globally. Nearly all children will have experienced at least one RSV infection by their second year of life. In 2019, there were 33 million RSV-associated cases of acute lower respiratory airway infection, 3.6 million RSV-associated hospital admissions, and 101 400 RSV-attributable deaths in children under 5 years of age. Over 97% of pediatric RSV-related deaths occur in children living in low- and middle-income countries. RSV infection in adults is generally mild and presents as low-level upper respiratory airway infections. However, older adults and those with chronic respiratory and/or cardiac conditions are more likely to experience severe disease. RSV-related complications include bronchiolitis (inflammation of the smaller airways in the lung), pneumonia, acute otitis media (infection of the middle ear) and conjunctivitis.         RSV is transmitted via droplets from the nose and throat of infected persons. The average incubation period from infection to symptoms is 4–6 days. Mild upper respiratory tract illness is most common, including symptoms and signs such as runny nose, sore throat, headache, fatigue and fever. In more severe cases, infection can lead to small airway obstruction due to accumulation of dead cells and mucus. Symptoms and signs consistent with lower respiratory tract infection include cough, shortness of breath, rapid breathing and wheezing. Very severe lung infection can result in low oxygen levels, respiratory muscle fatigue and death. RSV infection and disease occurs in almost all infants before the age of 2 years and most cases of severe disease occur among previously healthy infants. However, some infants are at particularly high risk of severe disease, including very premature infants, and those with underlying lung and heart disease. RSV lower respiratory tract infection in early life might lead to long-term respiratory consequences, including repeat hospitalizations for respiratory illness during infancy, recurrent wheeze and possible impaired lung function into adulthood. Adults are infected repeatedly with RSV throughout their lifetime. In general, younger adults have mild disease, but elderly people can develop severe disease. There is currently no treatment for RSV. Infections are usually self-limiting and resolve in 1–2 weeks. Healthy adults and infants infected with RSV typically do not require hospitalization, but medically attended RSV may require supportive care, which includes fever management, hydration, oxygen therapy and nutritional support. Several immunization products are currently available to prevent severe RSV disease in infants and elderly adults. To protect infants, there is a vaccine given to pregnant women and persons late in pregnancy, which allows transfer of antibodies against RSV through the placenta to the unborn baby, who is then protected after birth. Another immunization product to protect babies is a long-acting monoclonal antibody that targets the RSV virus and is given as an intramuscular injection to the baby soon after birth. Both products can protect babies for approximately six months. For elderly adults, three RSV vaccines are now available that are equally effective. Other vaccines and next generation monoclonal antibodies are in development.                                                                    ",WHO
Cancer,https://www.who.int/health-topics/cancer,"Cancer is a large group of diseases that can start in almost any organ or tissue of the body when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably, go beyond their usual boundaries to invade adjoining parts of the body and/or spread to other organs. The latter process is called metastasizing and is a major cause of death from cancer. A neoplasm and malignant tumour are other common names for cancer. Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths, or 1 in 6 deaths, in 2018. Lung, prostate, colorectal, stomach and liver cancer are the most common types of cancer in men, while breast, colorectal, lung, cervical and thyroid cancer are the most common among women. The cancer burden continues to grow globally, exerting tremendous physical, emotional and financial strain on individuals, families, communities and health systems. Many health systems in low- and middle-income countries are least prepared to manage this burden, and large numbers of cancer patients globally do not have access to timely quality diagnosis and treatment. In countries where health systems are strong, survival rates of many types of cancers are improving thanks to accessible early detection, quality treatment and survivorship care.              Between 30% and 50% of cancer deaths could be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk factors and implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies. The cancer burden can also be reduced through early detection of cancer and management of patients who develop cancer. Prevention also offers the most cost-effective long-term strategy for the control of cancer. Modifying or avoiding the following key risk factors can help prevent cancer: avoid tobacco use, including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco; maintain a healthy weight; eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables; exercise regularly; limit alcohol use; practice safe sex; get vaccinated against hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV); reduce exposure to ultraviolet radiation; prevent unnecessary ionizing radiation exposure (e.g. minimize occupational exposure, ensure safe and appropriate medical use of radiation in diagnosis and treatment); avoid urban air pollution and indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels; get regular medical care; and some chronic infections are also risk factors for cancer. People in low- and middle-income countries are more likely to develop cancer through chronic infections.                                  Cancer is more likely to respond to effective treatment when identified early, resulting in a greater probability of surviving as well as less morbidity and less expensive treatment. There are two distinct strategies that promote early detection: Early diagnosis identifies symptomatic cancer cases at the earliest possible stage. Screening aims to identify individuals with abnormalities suggestive of a specific cancer or pre-cancer who have not developed any symptoms and refer them promptly for diagnosis and treatment. Treatment options include surgery, cancer medicines and/or radiotherapy, administered alone or in combination. A multidisciplinary team of cancer professionals recommends the best possible treatment plan based on tumour type, cancer stage, clinical and other factors. The choice of treatment should be informed by patients’ preferences and consider the capacity of the health system. Palliative care, which focuses on improving the quality of life of patients and their families, is an essential component of cancer care. Survivorship care includes a detailed plan for monitoring cancer recurrence and detection of new cancers, assessing and managing long-term effects associated with cancer and/or its treatment, and services to ensure that cancer survivor needs are met.

Cholera,https://www.who.int/health-topics/cholera,"Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by eating or drinking food or water that is contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae . Cholera remains a global threat to public health and is an indicator of inequity and lack of social development. Researchers have estimated that every year, there are 1.3 to 4.0 million cases of cholera, and 21 000 to 143 000 deaths worldwide due to the infection. Cholera is an extremely serious disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea with severe dehydration. It takes between 12 hours and 5 days for a person to show symptoms after consuming contaminated food or water. Cholera affects both children and adults and can kill within hours if untreated. Most people infected with Vibrio cholerae do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection. This means the bacteria are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. Cholera is often predictable and preventable. It can ultimately be eliminated where access to clean water and sanitation facilities, as well as good hygiene practices, are ensured and sustained for the whole population.                    Measures for the prevention of cholera mostly consist of providing clean water and proper sanitation to populations who do not yet have access to basic services, as well as vaccination with Oral Cholera Vaccines. Health education and good food hygiene are also essential. Communities should be reminded of basic hygienic behaviours. These include the need to always wash hands with soap after defecation and before handling food or eating, as well as safe preparation and conservation of food. Strengthening surveillance and early warning systems are important measures to allow detection of the first cases in an outbreak and to put in place control measures as quickly as possible. Preventing and controlling cholera requires interventions beyond the health sector and it is vital to engage with partners across other sectors. The development and implementation of multi-sectoral cholera control plans is a useful mechanism to bring together all relevant sectors, and forge lines of communication and coordination that are valuable beyond cholera control.                             Since the creation of the global stockpile in 2013, more than 50 million doses of Oral cholera vaccines (OCV) have been successfully used in various settings through mass campaigns. OCV is a tool that is used in addition to classic cholera control measures. It should be systematically considered in both endemic cholera hotspots as well as during outbreaks and emergencies. OCV are safe and effective and are just one tool in a much larger toolbox that includes sustainable safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), but serve as a critical bridge to these longer-term efforts.

Marburg virus disease,https://www.who.int/health-topics/marburg-virus-disease,"Marburg virus disease (MVD) is a severe disease with a fatality ratio of up to 88%. This rate can be lower with good and early patient care. MVD was initially detected in 1967 after two simultaneous outbreaks in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany, and in Belgrade, Serbia. The outbreak was associated with laboratory work using African green monkeys ( Cercopithecus aethiops ) imported from Uganda. Subsequently, outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa (in a person with recent travel history to Zimbabwe), Tanzania and Uganda. Initially, human MVD infection results from prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by Rousettus fruit bat colonies. Once introduced in the human population, Marburg virus can spread through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.         The incubation period (interval from infection to onset of symptoms) varies from 2 to 21 days. MVD begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache and severe malaise. Muscle aches and pains are a common feature. Severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea and vomiting can begin on the third day. Non-itchy rash have been reported in patients between 2 and 7 days after onset of symptoms. From day 5 of the disease, patients may develop haemorrhagic manifestations, including fresh blood in vomitus and faeces, bleeding from the nose, gums and vagina. Bleeding at venepuncture sites (where intravenous access is obtained to give fluids or obtain blood samples) can also be observed. Involvement of the central nervous system can result in confusion, irritability and aggression. Orchitis (inflammation of one or both testicles) has been reported occasionally in the late phase of disease. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between 8 and 9 days after symptom onset, usually preceded by severe blood loss and shock. Early intensive supportive care including rehydration and treatment of specific symptoms can improve survival. Currently there are no vaccines or antiviral treatments approved for MVD. There are candidate monoclonal antibodies and antivirals, along with candidate vaccines that can be evaluated in clinical trials. Diagnosis It can be difficult to clinically distinguish MVD from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, meningitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers. Confirmation that symptoms are caused by Marburg virus infection are made using the following diagnostic methods: antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigen-capture detection tests reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay virus isolation by cell culture in maximum containment laboratories. Samples collected from patients are an extreme biohazard risk. Laboratory testing on non-inactivated samples should be conducted under maximum biological containment conditions. All non-inactivated biological specimens should be packaged using the triple packaging system when transported nationally and internationally.

Child health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/child-health,"Protecting and improving the health of children is of fundamental importance. Over the past several decades, we have seen dramatic progress in improving the health and reducing the mortality rate of young children. Among other encouraging statistics,
    the number of children dying before the age of 5 was halved from 2000 to 2017, and more mothers and children are surviving today than ever before. However, a great deal of work remains to further improve the health outcomes for children. The world is facing a double mandate. More than half of child deaths are due to conditions that could be easily prevented or treated given access to health care
    and improvements to their quality of life. At the same time, children must also be given a stable environment in which to thrive, including good health and nutrition, protection from threats and access to opportunities to learn and grow. Investing in children is one of the most important things
    a society can do to build a better future. Learn more about child health and COVID-19      WHO works with partners and Member States to improve the lives of all children and meet the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 3, which aims to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 by 2030. If all countries reach this goal, 11 million lives will be saved, more than half of them in sub-Saharan Africa. WHO advocates for health equity through universal health coverage (UHC) and the global availability of vaccines to prevent some of the deadliest childhood diseases. WHO also promotes infant and young child feeding, with a focus on exclusive breastfeeding for infants. It has developed and promotes an integrated approach to managing childhood illness that considers all aspects of a child’s health, and a continuum of care throughout the early years to safeguard their developmental outcomes, including the reduction of risk factors for diseases that can arise later in life. These goals are a collaboration between many WHO departments and coordinated through the Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health, and Ageing.                    Vast disparities exist around the world in a child’s chances of survival, with low- and middle-income countries disproportionately affected. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest child mortality rate in the world, in some places 15 times higher than in high-income countries. The leading causes of death among children include respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, measles, malaria, malnutrition and newborn conditions. Many child deaths are preventable through vaccination, adequate home care, access to health care services, improved rates of breastfeeding and better nutrition. However, many of the life-saving interventions are beyond the reach of the world’s poorest people. Survival is just one of many issues relevant to children’s health. Child health, growth and development are inseparable. In 2016, at least 250 million children were not able to reach their full physical or psychological development. This represents the staggering figure of 43%. Violence against children is also rampant. In 2019, abuse or neglect affected as many as 1 billion children.                                                    ",WHO
Women's health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/women-s-health,"Being a man or a woman has a significant impact on health, as a result of both biological and gender-related differences. The health of women and girls is of particular concern because, in many societies, they are disadvantaged by discrimination rooted in sociocultural factors. For example, women and girls face increased vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Some of the sociocultural factors that prevent women and girls to benefit from quality health services and attaining the best possible level of health include: unequal power relationships between men and women; social norms that decrease education and paid employment opportunities; an exclusive focus on women’s reproductive roles; and potential or actual experience of physical, sexual and emotional violence. While poverty is an important barrier to positive health outcomes for both men and women, poverty tends to yield a higher burden on women and girls’ health due to, for example, feeding practices (malnutrition) and use of unsafe cooking fuels (COPD).

Rabies,https://www.who.int/health-topics/rabies,"Rabies is a viral zoonotic disease that causes
progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Clinically, it
has two forms: Furious rabies – characterized by hyperactivity and hallucinations. Paralytic rabies – characterized by paralysis and coma. Although fatal once clinical signs appear,
rabies is entirely avoidable; vaccines, medicines and technologies have long
been available to prevent death from rabies. Nevertheless, rabies still kills
tens of thousands of people each year. Of these cases, approximately 99% are
acquired from the bite of an infected dog. Dog-mediated human rabies can be eliminated by
tackling the disease at its source: infected dogs. Making people aware of how
to avoid the bites of rabid dogs, to seek treatment when bitten and to
vaccinate animals can successfully disrupt the rabies transmission cycle. Rabies is estimated to cause 59 000 human
deaths annually in over 150 countries, with 95% of cases occurring in Africa
and Asia. Due to underreporting and uncertain estimates, this number is likely
a gross underestimate. The burden of disease is disproportionally borne by
rural poor populations, with approximately half of cases attributable to
children under 15 years of age.         Early symptoms of a rabies infection can
include a fever with pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking or
burning sensation (paraesthesia) at the wound site. In later states, the virus
spreads to the central nervous system, causing fatal inflammation of the brain
and spinal cord. The incubation period of the disease can vary from 1 week to 1
year, though it is typically 2–3 months. The two types of rabies show different
symptoms. Furious rabies causes signs of hyperactivity, excitable behaviour,
hydrophobia (fear of water) and sometimes aerophobia (fear of drafts or of
fresh air). Death occurs after a few days due to cardio-respiratory arrest. Paralytic rabies, which accounts for about
20% of the total number of human cases, runs a less dramatic and usually longer
course than the furious form. Muscles gradually become paralysed, starting at
the site of the bite or scratch. A coma slowly develops and eventually death
occurs. The paralytic form of rabies is often misdiagnosed, contributing to the
under-reporting of the disease. Vaccinating dogs is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people, and human rabies vaccines exist for pre-exposure immunization. If you are bitten or scratched by an animal, particularly a dog: Wash the wound immediately with soap or detergent. Flush the wound thoroughly for about 15 minutes with copious amounts of water. Apply an iodine-containing or anti-viral medication to the wound 15 minutes after it has been washed and flushed. Avoid applying irritants to the wounds such as chili powder, plant juices, acids and alkalis. Avoid covering the wound with dressings or bandages. Seek transportation to a health care facility for further assessment and treatment by a healthcare professional. If possible, safely confine the biting animal and collect information on it and the bite circumstance to provide to the health care professional and public health officer. Keep the biting animal confined and under observation for 10 days. WHO continues to promote human rabies prevention through the elimination of rabies in dogs, dog bite prevention strategies, and more widespread use of the intradermal route for post-exposure prophylaxis, which reduces volume and therefore the cost of cell-cultured vaccine by 60% to 80%.

Global health ethics,https://www.who.int/health-topics/ethics-and-health,"Ethical questions related to health, health care, and public health cover topics as diverse as moral issues around reproduction, state obligations in the provision of health care services, and appropriate measures to control infectious disease. Scholars and health care professionals have debated ethical questions related to health and health care since the earliest days of medicine. Recent formal efforts to articulate international standards of ethics applicable to health and health care can
        be traced to the Nuremberg trials of 1947, during which the horrors of Nazi medical experiments came to light. The principles that emerged from those trials, known as the Nuremberg Code, are broadly applicable to many types of health-related research involving
human participants, including clinical trials. The growing breadth and complexity of contemporary health challenges have produced a range of difficult questions that cannot always be adequately addressed by relying exclusively on existing policies,
guidelines or codes of conduct. Debates over access to new and expensive pharmaceuticals and medical technologies, as well as increasing awareness of the gross health disparities that exist both within and between countries, have called attention to the
need for an ethics of health policy and practice.                                                  Research ethics govern the standards of conduct for scientific researchers. It is important to adhere to ethical principles in order to protect the dignity, rights and welfare of research participants. The WHO Manual (Section XV.2) defines research with human subjects as 'any social science, biomedical, behavioural, or epidemiological activity that entails systematic collection or analysis of data with the intent to generate new knowledge, in which human beings: are exposed to manipulation, intervention, observation, or other interaction with investigators either directly or through alteration of their environment; or become individually identifiable through investigator's collection, preparation, or use of biological material or medical or other records. Immunization raises a host of challenging ethical questions that researchers, governments, funders, pharmaceutical companies, and communities must confront. TB : Ethical issues include questions about the equitable distribution of resources, protection of vulnerable groups, respect for patient choice of treatment options and solidarity between communities during outbreaks. Zika has raised many specific ethical issues, in particular regarding pregnancy. At the same time, it has highlighted ethical issues that arise in vector-borne diseases more generally. The HIV epidemic has raised many ethical challenges for public health officials, researchers and clinicians, reaching from macro-level policy to micro-level clinical decisions.

Micronutrients,https://www.who.int/health-topics/micronutrients,"Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals needed by the body in very small amounts. However, their impact on a body’s health are critical, and deficiency in any of them can cause severe and even life-threatening conditions. They perform a range of functions, including enabling the body to produce enzymes, hormones and other substances needed for normal growth and development. Deficiencies in iron, vitamin A and iodine are the most common around the world, particularly in children and pregnant women. Low- and middle-income counties bear the disproportionate burden of micronutrient deficiencies. Micronutrient deficiencies can cause visible and dangerous health conditions, but they can also lead to less clinically notable reductions in energy level, mental clarity and overall capacity. This can lead to reduced educational outcomes, reduced work productivity and increased risk from other diseases and health conditions. Many of these deficiencies are preventable through nutrition education and consumption of a healthy diet containing diverse foods, as well as food fortification and supplementation, where needed.  These programmes have made great strides in reducing micronutrient deficiencies in recent decades but more efforts are needed     Micronutrient deficiencies can cause several serious health issues. A lack of iron, folate and vitamins B12 and A can lead to anaemia. Anaemia is a condition in which there is a reduced number of red blood cells or haemoglobin concentration, causing fatigue, weakness, shortage of breath and dizziness.  This can further lead to difficulties in functioning in work, education and community engagement. An estimated 42% of children under 5 years of age and 40% of pregnant women worldwide are anaemic. Severe iodine deficiency can lead to brain damage and during pregnancy can cause a number of issues including stillbirth, spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies. Less severe iodine deficiency may still cause mental impairment that reduces intellectual capacity.  The preferred strategy for the control of iodine deficiency remains universal salt iodization, which requires that all food-grade salt used in household and food processing be fortified with iodine. UNICEF estimates that 66% of households globally have access to iodized salt. Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable blindness in children and increases the risk of disease and death from severe infections such as diarrhoeal disease and measles. Vitamin A deficiency may also occur in women during the last trimester of pregnancy in high-risk areas. Breastfeeding is the best way to protect babies from vitamin A deficiency and, in areas where vitamin A deficiency is a public health problem, vitamin A supplementation is recommended in infants and children 6-59 months of age.        WHO works with Member States and partners to prevent micronutrient deficiencies though a number of programmes and following the WHO 2016–2025 nutrition strategy . These programmes include iron and folic acid supplementation, high dose vitamin A supplementation, the promotion of breastfeeding, fortification of foods with micronutrients, and healthy, diverse diets containing foods naturally rich in vitamin and minerals. For example, salt iodization has helped reduce the rate of iodine deficiency around the world, while the fortification of wheat flour with iron and folic acid has helped reduce rates of anaemia and neural tube defects. WHO collaborates with UN partners to disseminate global guidance on the assessment of micronutrient status and effective micronutrient interventions. These guidelines allow WHO and other agencies to better respond to populations affected by emergencies when micronutrient deficiencies are more common due to chronic and severe food insecurity.

Onchocerciasis (river blindness),https://www.who.int/health-topics/onchocerciasis,"Onchocerciasis – or “river blindness” – is a parasitic disease caused by the filarial worm Onchocerca volvulus transmitted by repeated bites of infected blackflies ( Simulium spp.). These blackflies breed along fast-flowing rivers and streams, 
close to remote villages located near fertile land where people rely on 
agriculture. In the human body, the adult worms produce embryonic larvae 
(microfilariae) that migrate to the skin, eyes and other organs. When a 
female blackfly bites an infected person during a blood meal, it also 
ingests microfilariae which develop further in the blackfly and are then
 transmitted to the next human host during subsequent bites.         Onchocerciasis is an eye and skin disease. Symptoms are caused by 
the microfilariae, which move around the human body in the subcutaneous 
tissue and induce intense inflammatory responses when they die. Infected
 people may show symptoms such as severe itching and various skin 
changes. Some infected people develop eye lesions which can lead to 
visual impairment and permanent blindness. In most cases, nodules under 
the skin form around the adult worms. Onchocerciasis occurs mainly in tropical areas. More than 99% of 
infected people live in 31 countries in sub-Saharan Africa: Angola, 
Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, 
Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya,
 Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal,

Where O. volvulus co-exists with Loa loa , treatment strategies have to be adjusted. Loa loa is a parasitic filarial worm that is endemic in Cameroon, the Central 
African Republic, Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria 
and South Sudan. Treatment of individuals with high levels of L. loa in the blood can sometimes result in severe adverse events. In affected

Intellectual property and trade,https://www.who.int/health-topics/intellectual-property,"Intellectual property refers to intellectual activity in the industrial, scientific, literary and artistic fields. In the context of health care, the concept relates to topics such as the use of generic medicines, specifically how companies can market and sell these products within specific geographic regions. Intellectual property rights and the laws that govern them are important both to the control of standards and access to medicines, but also as an incentive for the development of new pharmaceuticals and health care products. There has been great debate in recent years about the issue of intellectual property protection relating to access to generic medicines. This is particularly the case in areas where drug development is needed to treat a disease endemic to the region, but where the market is not large enough to support the costs of research. The balance needed between access and profit are at the heart of these debates and continue through discussions of free trade and regulation.     Intellectual property rights to medicines and other medical products can be an incentive for the private sector to pursue innovation. However, this system is made more complicated for products intended for populations where the potential paying market is small or uncertain. Low- and middle-income countries, which account for more than 80% of the world’s population, are responsible for just 10% of global sales of many drugs due to the difficulty in affording or accessing necessary products. Poverty affects purchasing power, and the inability of poor people to pay reduces effective demand, which in turn affects the degree of interest of for-profit companies. Member States, the pharmaceutical industry, charitable foundations and nongovernmental organizations have taken initiatives in recent years to develop new products against diseases affecting poor and middle-income countries and to increase access to existing health products and medical devices. International intellectual property agreements also contain flexibilities that could facilitate increased access to necessary pharmaceutical products. However, these initiatives are not sufficient to surmount the challenges of ensuring access and innovation for needed health products and medical devices. Much work is required to reverse the skewing of world drug markets towards the wealthiest nations.        Much of WHO’s work with intellectual property and trade relates to the World Trade Organization framework from 2001, known as the Doha Declaration and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) . In 2006, the WHO Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and Public Health (CIPIH) submitted its report containing 60 recommendations
    aimed at fostering innovation and improving access to medicines. Since the entry into force of the TRIPS Agreement, many resolutions of the World Health Assemblies have requested WHO to address the impact of trade agreements and intellectual property
protection on public health and access to medicines. WHO closely collaborates with other relevant international and regional organizations, such as the World Trade Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization, to support Member States
on matters of intellectual property and trade policies, conduct training on the health impact of trade agreements, research innovation and intellectual property, and facilitate access to patent information.                                                                 ",WHO
Digital health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/digital-health,"Digital technologies are now integral to daily life, and the world’s population has never been more interconnected. Innovation, particularly in the digital sphere, is happening at unprecedented scale. Even so, its application to improve the health of populations remains largely untapped, and there is immense scope for use of digital health solutions. WHO is harnessing the power of digital technologies and health innovation to accelerate global attainment of health and well-being.                                                    WHO has three key objectives to promote the adoption and scale-up of digital health and innovation: 1. Translating latest data, research, and evidence into action: this means promoting standards for interoperability and data sharing and supporting implementation of digital solutions that contribute to informed decision making. 2. Enhancing knowledge through scientific communities of practice: enabled by new technologies and no longer limited by the need for physical meetings or hard copy peer review journals, WHO brings together top expert voices around topics
    of clinical and public health significance. 3. Systematically assessing and linking country needs with supply of innovations: all too often in global health, products are developed with the attitude of “if you build it, they will use it.” This approach has failed time
    and again. WHO takes a proactive, systematic approach to identify, promote, co-develop, and scale innovations that are based on country needs. The WHO Global Strategy on Digital Health, adopted in 2020 by the World Health Assembly, presents a roadmap to link the latest developments in innovation and digital health, and put these tools to action in order to improve health outcomes.

Travel and health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/travel-and-health,"Travellers may encounter various health risks during travel. The risks can depend on many things, including the health of the traveller, the type of travel, and the destination. Health risks can come from factors such as changes in temperature and humidity, air pollution, issues of safety and security, access to health and dental care services and products, exposure to infectious diseases, access to safe food and water, sanitation and hygiene standards, availability of facilities and equipment for disabled people, and local laws and customs. International travel can be stressful. Travellers may be away from family and friends and may need to adjust to foreign cultures and languages. Coping with high levels of stress may cause physical, social and psychological problems. Changes to the circadian rhythm (e.g. jet lag) and sleep deprivation can trigger seizures in people with epilepsy, provoke migraine attacks and cause more behavioural symptoms in people living with dementia. All individuals planning travel should seek information or advice on potential health risks before they travel. It is important for travellers to understand how best to avoid or minimize these risks, take appropriate preventive measures, and exercise necessary precautions before, during and after travel.                                                      Travellers should prepare themselves in several ways before departure. First, it is important to gather information about the potential health risks early in the planning stage. Travellers should also be aware of differences in local laws and customs, including those relating to substance use and sexual relationships. Travellers should visit a travel clinic, preferably 4–8 weeks before departure or earlier, but it’s useful even if it’s very close to the departure date. There may be additional considerations for certain groups of travellers, including infants and young children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, older people, people with disabilities, and those who have underlying health conditions, including mental, neurological and substance use conditions . Travellers are strongly advised to obtain comprehensive travel insurance as a matter of routine and to declare any underlying health conditions to their travel insurers. Sufficient medical supplies, including prescribed medications, should be carried to cover the duration of the trip, including possible delays and change of plans. Toiletries should also be carried in sufficient quantity for the entire duration of the trip unless their availability at the travel destination is assured. During travel When travelling, always have important health documents with you, such as health insurance certificates and vaccine or malaria prophylaxis records. In some countries, some medications are illegal to carry (such as psychotropics), and travellers should have a letter written and signed by their doctor certifying the need to carry them. Have these documents ready to be presented if requested by officials. Travellers should also: continue to take medications for chronic health conditions, if applicable be mindful of road safety be mindful of food and water safety precautions be mindful of the need for protection from extreme weather, such as heat waves. After travel Travellers should seek medical attention on their return home if they: are ill in the weeks after they return home, particularly with fever, persistent diarrhoea, vomiting, jaundice, urinary disorders, skin disease or anogenital infection (genital warts); received treatment for malaria while travelling; may have been exposed during travel to an infectious disease, including sexually transmitted infections, even if they have no symptoms; or have a previous health condition that gets worse. Travellers should seek medical care immediately in these cases and not wait for a regularly scheduled consultation.

diseases encompass a wide range of illnesses from diarrhoea to cancers.
Most present as gastrointestinal issues, though they can also produce neurological, gynaecological and immunological symptoms. Diseases

migration and growing international travel compound these issues and expose people to new hazards. WHO works to assist Member States in building capacity to prevent,
detect and manage foodborne risks. Foodborne diseases are reflected in several
targets of Sustainable Developmental Goal 3 and are a priority area within the
Organization’s work. Activities include research and independent scientific
assessments of food-related hazards, foodborne disease awareness programs, and
helping to promote food safety through national health-care programs. The WHO Five Keys to Safer Food manual provides straightforward tips and guidelines on
how to produce, process, handle and consume food to limit spreading and
contracting foodborne illnesses. In collaboration with the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization, WHO created the Codex Alimentarius, a nongovernmental interagency
organization tasked with creating food standards, guidelines, and codes of
practice that contributes to the safety, quality, and fairness of the
international food trade. The two agencies also developed the International
Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) to rapidly share information during
food safety emergencies.                                                                        ",WHO
Assistive technology,https://www.who.int/health-topics/assistive-technology,"Assistive technology enables and promotes inclusion and participation, especially of persons with disability, aging populations, and people with non-communicable diseases. The primary purpose of assistive products is to maintain or improve an individual’s functioning and independence, thereby promoting their well-being. They enable people to live healthy, productive, independent and dignified lives, and to participate in education, the labour market and civic life. Examples of assistive products include hearing aids, wheelchairs, spectacles, prostheses and devices that support memory, among many others. While supporting independence and well-being, these products can also help to prevent or reduce the effects of secondary health conditions, such as lower limb amputation in people with diabetes. They can also reduce the need and impact on carers and mitigate the need for formal health and support services. Moreover, access to appropriate assistive products can have a tremendous impact on community development and economic growth. Despite the global need and recognized benefits of assistive products, access to assistive products remains limited. Addressing this unmet need is essential to progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and realizing the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.             WHO’s vision is that everyone, everywhere, has the right to the highest attainable standard of health. Assistive technology is fundamental to achieve this vision, as they ensure that people with disabilities, older people and those affected by health conditions are able to live a healthy and dignified life and are included in society. As part of that commitment, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development places well-being and universal health coverage at the centre of its development vision, with the commitment to leave no one behind. In addition, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has recognized access to assistive technology as a human right and has called for international cooperation to improve global access (Article 32). In 2018, delegates at the Seventy-first World Health Assembly adopted the resolution Improving access to assistive technology, urging Member States to develop, implement and strengthen policies and programmes to improve access to assistive technology as a move towards universal health coverage. WHO coordinates the Global Cooperation on Assistive Technology (GATE) as a step towards realizing the Sustainable Development Goals, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and implementing the resolution WHA71.8 on assistive technology. The GATE initiative has the goal to support countries in addressing challenges and improving access to assistive products within their context. Read about the GATE initiative Join the GATE Community                                           Despite the growing number of people in need of assistive products in every country, many do not have the access they require. This is particularly the case in low- and middle-income countries, where access to these life-changing products has been found to be as low as 3%. These gaps exist for several reasons, including high cost and a lack of financing, availability, awareness and trained personnel. Challenges exist both in low- and high-income countries. Very few countries globally have developed a national assistive technology policy or programme and so provide assistive products through the private sector. Even in high-income countries, assistive products are often rationed or not included within health and welfare schemes, leading to high out-of-pocket payments by users and their families. People may be left to rely on erratic donations or charity services, which often means the products are of low quality or inappropriate for the person’s needs. Those who can afford them often purchase items from pharmacies, private clinics, or workshops. In these scenarios, people often are not taught how to use the product safely and lack access to follow-up appointments, which are essential to ensure that the product meets the person’s needs and that it is in good working order.

Financial protection,https://www.who.int/health-topics/financial-protection,"Financial protection is at the core of universal health coverage (UHC) and is one of the final coverage goals of health financing policies. It is achieved when direct payments made to obtain health services do not expose people to financial hardship and do not threaten living standards. The key to protecting people is to ensure prepayment and pooling of resources for health rather than relying on people paying for health services out-of-pocket (OOP) at the time of use. Catastrophic out-of-pocket health spending, defined as exceeding 10% of a household budget, continues to rise. More than one billion people, about 14% of the global population, experienced such large out-of-pocket payments relative to their budgets. But even small expenditures in absolute terms can be devastating for low-income families; approximately 1.3 billion individuals were pushed or further pushed into poverty by such payments, including 300 million people who were already living in extreme poverty. For more information, please see the reports here and visit the UHC fact sheet.  In-depth, context-specific analysis and evaluations of health financing policies are needed to understand the drivers of trends. Financial protection is undermined by heavy reliance on out-of-pocket (OOP) health spending in all countries at all income levels. OOP health spending undermines efforts to eradicate poverty, which can be avoided by minimizing OOP health spending for people living close to poverty, and eliminating such payments for people living in poverty. Financial protection is not guaranteed by participation in a health coverage scheme. There are different ways of financing health systems to ensure a population is financially protected, however, evidence shows that more significant prepaid, pooled, compulsory payments are needed. Public health funding must increase further and be used more efficiently and equitably.  Different revenue sources must be pooled or their utilization better coordinated.  The size of compulsory prepaid funds must be sufficiently large; prepaid funds must be redistributed; and coverage for medicines must beextended. OOP spending on health must be limited to low, fixed, and capped co-payments, and removed completely for the poor and most vulnerable. Removing financial barriers to care reduces forgone care, thereby improving service coverage and financial protection.

Chemical incidents,https://www.who.int/health-topics/chemical-incidents,"A chemical incident is the uncontrolled release of a toxic substance, potentially resulting in harm to public health and the environment. Chemical incidents can occur as a result of natural events, or as a result of accidental or intentional events. These incidents can be sudden and acute or have a slow onset when there is a ‘silent’ release of a chemical. They can also range from small releases to full-scale major emergencies. The term “chemical incident” might refer to anthropogenic or technological events, including: an explosion at a factory that stores or uses chemicals contamination of the food or water supply with a chemical an oil spill a leak from a storage unit during transportation deliberate release of chemicals in conflict or terrorism an outbreak of disease that is associated with a chemical exposure. Chemical incidents arising from natural sources include volcanos, earthquakes and forest fires. An estimated 65 000 people died due to technological events between 2009-2018. As the production and use of chemicals continues to increase worldwide the health sector must expand its traditional roles and responsibilities to be able to address the public health and medical issues associated with the use of chemicals and their health effects.     Chemical incidents, especially acts of terrorism, may also cause fear and anxiety in populations, as well as injury from fire, explosion or toxicity. Depending on the chemical exposure, symptoms may present themselves differently. In general, the adverse health outcomes to toxic chemical exposure may be: effects that are local or arise at the site of contact with the chemical, such as bronchoconstriction from respiratory irritants, or irritation of the skin and eyes by gases, liquids and solids; effects that are systemic or affect organ systems remote from the site of absorption, such as depression of the central nervous system from inhalation of solvents, or necrosis of the liver from the inhalation of carbon tetrachloride; and effects on mental health arising from real or perceived releases, which depend on the psychosocial stress associated with an incident. The time elapsing between exposure and the onset of symptoms can vary: Some effects, for example eye and respiratory irritation or central nervous system depression, can occur rapidly, within minutes or hours of exposure. Other effects, for example congenital malformations or cancers, may take months or years to appear. WHO works closely with countries and partners to monitor and report on their emergency preparedness capacities for all hazards, including for chemical incidents. Surveillance of diseases of possible chemical etiology is a daily element in WHO’s outbreak alert and response activities. WHO also convenes regional meetings to strengthen the global network of poison centres and thus facilitate emergency responses to chemical incidents. Guidance and training materials to strengthen preparedness for chemical incidents and emergencies have been developed in collaboration with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Inter-Organization Programme for the Sound Management of Chemicals, and relevant organizations in the United Nations system.

Nutrition,https://www.who.int/health-topics/nutrition,"Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better nutrition is related to improved infant, child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and longevity. Healthy children learn better. People with adequate nutrition are more productive and can create opportunities to gradually break the cycles of poverty and hunger. Malnutrition, in every form, presents significant threats to human health. Today the world faces a double burden of malnutrition that includes both undernutrition and overweight, especially in low- and middle-income countries. There are multiple forms of malnutrition, including undernutrition (wasting or stunting), inadequate vitamins or minerals, overweight, obesity, and resulting diet-related noncommunicable diseases. The developmental, economic, social, and medical impacts of the global burden of malnutrition are serious and lasting for individuals and their families, for communities and for countries. Learn about Nutrition and Food Safety and COVID-19             According to the 2016–2025 nutrition strategy, WHO uses its convening power to help set, align and advocate for priorities and policies that move nutrition forward globally; develops evidence-informed guidance based on robust scientific and ethical frameworks; supports the adoption of guidance and implementation of effective nutrition actions; and monitors and evaluates policy and programme implementation and nutrition outcomes. This work is framed by the Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant, and young child nutrition, adopted by Member States through a World Health Assembly resolution in 2012. Actions to end malnutrition are also vital for achieving the diet-related targets of the Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020, the Global strategy for women’s, children’s, and adolescent’s health 2016–2030, the report of the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity (2016), and the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. In May 2018, the Health Assembly approved the 13th General Programme of Work (GPW13), which guides the work of WHO in 2019–2023. Reduction of salt/sodium intake and elimination of industrially produced trans-fats from the food supply are identified in GPW13 as part of WHO’s priority actions to achieve the aims of ensuring healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.   Most recent estimates show that globally, 149.2 million children under the age of 5 years of age are stunted (too short for their age) and 45.4 million are wasted (underweight for their height).  The number of children with stunting is declining in all regions except Africa. Over three-quarters of all children suffering from severe wasting live in Asia. Around 45% of deaths among children under 5 years of age are linked to undernutrition. These mostly occur in low- and middle-income countries. Anaemia is a serious global public health problem that particularly affects young children and pregnant women. WHO estimates that 40% of children less than 5 years of age and 37% of pregnant women worldwide are anaemic. Thirty percent of women of reproductive age have anaemia. Globally, 1.9 billion adults are overweight or obese and 38.9 million children under 5 years of age are overweight. Rates of childhood overweight and obesity are rising, particularly in high-income and upper-middle-income countries. Although breastfeeding protects against undernutrition and overweight, only 44% of infants under 6 months of age are exclusively breastfed. High sodium consumption (>5 g salt/day) contributes to high blood pressure and increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. Most people consume too much salt – on average 9–12 grams per day, or around twice the recommended maximum level of intake.                                                              ",WHO
Child growth,https://www.who.int/health-topics/child-growth,"Child malnutrition is a major public health issue worldwide. An
estimated 144 million children under age 5 are stunted, 47 million are wasted
and 38.3 million have overweight or obesity. Around 45% of deaths among
children under 5 years of age are linked to undernutrition. Measuring the growth of infants and children is an important part of child
health surveillance. Inadequate infant growth due to poor nutrition leads to
under-nutrition in children in many low- and middle-income countries, which, if
followed later in life by an increased intake of calories, can result in
overweight or obesity. The WHO Child Growth Standards are a diagnostic
tool used to monitor and assess the nutritional status of infants and young
children worldwide. By tracking children’s height and body weight, the
standards detect children or populations not growing properly, or who are underweight
or at risk of overweight, and who may require specific health services or
public health responses. The WHO Child Growth Standards have charts for boys and girls separated,
covering age birth to 5 years. They are used in doctors’ offices, clinics and
other health facilities, and by research institutions, child health advocacy
organizations and ministries of health Learn about Nutrition and Food Safety and COVID-19     Child stunting refers to a child who is too short for his or her age and is
the result of chronic or recurrent malnutrition. Stunting is a contributing
risk factor to child mortality and is also a marker of inequalities in human
development. Child overweight refers to a child who is too heavy for his or her
height. This form of malnutrition usually results from expending too few calories
for the amount of food consumed or from endocrine disbalances, and it increases
the risk of noncommunicable diseases later in life. Child wasting refers to a
child who is too thin for his or her height and is the result of recent rapid
weight loss or the failure to gain weight. A child who is moderately or
severely wasted has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible. Childhood wasting and overweight are both forms of malnutrition and can
coexist in a population. In 2020, wasting (low weight for height) and
overweight was found in 6.7% of children under 5 (45.4 million) and 5.7% of
children under 5 (38.9 million), respectively.         In 2020, 22% of children under age 5 worldwide (149.2 million) suffered from
stunting, a decline from 24.4% in 2015. To achieve the target of a 50%
reduction in the number of stunted children by 2030, the annual rate of decline
must double (to 3.9% per year) from its current annual reduction rate of 2.1%
per year. Although malnutrition can manifest in multiple ways, the path to prevention
is virtually identical: adequate maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy
and while breastfeeding; optimal breastfeeding in the first two years of life;
nutritious, diverse and safe complementary foods in early childhood; and a
healthy environment, including access to basic health, water, hygiene and
sanitation services and opportunities for safe physical activity. Many of these vital pathways to good nutrition are under threat – including
due to the COVID-19 pandemic – and have the potential to undermine progress
towards ending malnutrition in all its forms. As the world responds to and
recovers from the pandemic, urgent action is critical to protect maternal and
child nutrition – especially in the most affected regions – and secure a future
where the right to nutrition is a reality for every child.                                                                ",WHO
Emergency and critical care,https://www.who.int/health-topics/emergency-care,"All around the world, acutely ill and injured people seek care every day. First contact health workers manage children and adults with medical, surgical and obstetric emergencies, including injuries, sepsis, heart attacks and strokes, asthma and acute complications of pregnancy. Many proven health interventions are time dependent. Emergency care is an integrated platform for delivering accessible, quality and time-sensitive health care services for acute illness and injury across the life course. Integrated emergency care services facilitate timely recognition, treatment management and, when needed, continued treatment of the acutely ill at the appropriate level of the health system. Critical care is an ongoing, intensive treatment provided to patients with life-threatening illnesses or injuries that require close, constant monitoring and support. Care is typically delivered in critical care units (e.g. intensive care units or high dependency units). Critically ill patients often need advanced medical equipment and therapies, intravenous medications to support heart function or blood pressure, and continuous monitoring of vital signs. Over half of deaths and over a third of disability in low- and middle-income countries could be addressed by the implementation of effective emergency and critical care. Prioritizing an integrated approach to early recognition, resuscitation, treatment and prevention of complications from acute conditions reduces the morbidity and mortality from a wide range of diseases across the life course.     The recent pandemic has revealed pervasive gaps in the provision of emergency and critical care and reinforced the need for an integrated approach to these services. Emergency and critical care are pivotal service delivery platforms of health systems, and have an essential role in saving lives, reducing disabilities, and preventing complications. Especially when there are logistical or financial barriers to healthcare access, people may present for care only when symptomatic with acute illness or injury. Emergency care is powerfully aligned with the primary health care agenda as it provides first contact clinical care for those who are acutely ill or injured. Pre-hospital and facility-based emergency care is a high impact and cost-effective form of secondary prevention. Ongoing critical care ensures adequate monitoring, reassessment and continuing comprehensive treatment to maximize patient outcomes. Emergency and critical care play an important role in public health. Disease surveillance at facilities delivering emergency and critical care is essential to guide primary prevention and outbreak response. Building capacity for emergency and critical care is the vital foundation for the health systems ability to surge during larger scale health emergencies such as conflict, natural disaster or outbreaks of epidemic disease.        The Seventy-sixth World Health Assembly called on WHO to prioritize integrated emergency, critical and operative care for universal health coverage (UHC) and protection from health emergencies (WHA 76.2). WHO is dedicated to assisting countries to strengthen their emergency and critical care systems to ensure quality everyday clinical care and robust responses during times of crisis. Through collaborative efforts and partnerships, WHO advocates for the integration of emergency and critical care into national healthcare agendas, emphasizing the importance of building national capacities to enhance clinical service readiness, preparedness and resilience. This includes working closely with partner agencies within the UN system to ensure that emergency and critical care are appropriately represented in UHC packages and planning and disaster readiness and response. WHO’s work plan on emergency and critical care encompasses various facets, including advocacy, policy and planning, assessment at system level and health facility level, clinical learning programmes, clinical process tools and improvement of clinical care. WHO's Clinical Services and System Unit is dedicated to strengthening health systems to deliver emergency and critical care, particularly in first contact locations, and to supporting the development of quality, timely emergency and critical care accessible to all.

Patient safety,https://www.who.int/health-topics/patient-safety,"The global landscape of health care is changing with health systems operating in increasingly complex environments. While new treatments, technologies and care models can have therapeutic potential, they can also pose new threats to safe care. Patient safety is a fundamental principle of health care and is now being recognized as a large and growing global public health challenge. Global efforts to reduce the burden of patient harm have not achieved substantial change over the past 15 years, despite pioneering work in some health care settings. Patient safety is a framework of organized activities that creates cultures, processes, procedures, behaviours, technologies and environments in health care that consistently and sustainably lower risks, reduce the occurrence of avoidable harm, make error less likely and reduce its impact when it does occur. Every point in the process of care-giving contains a certain degree of inherent unsafety. Clear policies, organizational leadership capacity, data to drive safety improvements, skilled health care professionals and effective involvement of patients and families in the care process, are all needed to ensure sustainable and significant improvements in the safety of health care.             Recognizing the huge burden of patient harm in health care, the 72nd World Health Assembly, in May 2019, adopted a resolution (WHA72.6) on “Global action on patient safety”, which endorsed the establishment of World Patient Safety Day, to be observed every year on 17 September; and recognized “patient safety as a global health priority”. The resolution urges Member States to recognize patient safety as a key priority in health sector policies and programmes, and requests the Director-General of WHO to emphasize patient safety as a key strategic priority in WHO’s work, especially within the universal health coverage (UHC) agenda. The resolution also requests WHO’s Director-General “to formulate a global patient safety action plan in consultation with Member States, regional economic integration organizations and all relevant stakeholders, including in the private sector”. This plan will be based on the guiding principles of equity, sustainability and accountability. The proposed action plan will seek inspiration and coherence with existing global action plans developed by WHO and other global health and development agencies. Responding to the unprecedented global patient safety movement, the need for very urgent and concerted action in this area, and aligning with the Sustainable Developmental Goals, WHO’s Director-General launched the WHO Flagship Initiative “A Decade of Patient Safety 2020-2030” in February 2020.   Patient safety in health care is an urgent and serious global public health concern. Patient harm exerts a very high burden on all health care systems across the world. Every year, an inadmissible number of patients suffer injuries or die because of unsafe and poor quality health care. Most of these injuries are avoidable. The burden of unsafe care broadly highlights the magnitude and scale of the problem. Patient harm due to adverse events is likely to be among the 10 leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Most of these deaths and injuries are avoidable. It is commonly reported that around 1 in 10 hospitalized patients experience harm, with at least 50% being preventable. Around two-thirds of all adverse events resulting from unsafe care, and the years lost to disability and death, occur in LMICs. It is estimated that the cost of harm associated with the loss of life or permanent disability, which results in lost capacity and productivity of the affected patients and families, amounts to trillions of US dollars every year. Furthermore, the psychological cost to the patient and their family (associated with the loss or disabling of a loved one), is certainly significant, though more difficult to measure.

Soil-transmitted helminthiases,https://www.who.int/health-topics/soil-transmitted-helminthiases,"Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are among the most common 
infections worldwide and affect the poorest and most deprived 
communities. They are transmitted by eggs present in human faeces which 
in turn contaminate soil in areas where sanitation is poor. The main species that infect people are the roundworm ( Ascaris lumbricoides ), the whipworm ( Trichuris trichiura ) and the hookworms ( Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale ). Intestinal worms produce a wide range of symptoms including 
intestinal manifestations (diarrhoea, abdominal pain), general malaise 
and weakness. Hookworms cause chronic intestinal blood loss that result 
in anaemia. Soil-transmitted helminths are transmitted by eggs that are passed in
 the faeces of infected people. Adult worms live in the intestine where 
they produce thousands of eggs each day. In areas that lack adequate 
sanitation, these eggs contaminate the
        soil. This can happen in several ways: eggs that are attached to vegetables are ingested when the vegetables are not carefully cooked, washed or peeled; eggs are ingested from contaminated water sources; eggs are ingested by children who play in the contaminated soil and then put their hands in their mouths without washing them.         Morbidity is related to the number of worms harboured. People with 
infections of light intensity (few worms) usually do not suffer from the
 infection. Heavier infections can cause a range of symptoms including 
intestinal manifestations (diarrhoea
        and abdominal pain), malnutrition, general malaise and weakness,
 and impaired growth and physical development. Infections of very high intensity can cause intestinal obstruction that should be treated surgically. S. stercoralis may cause dermatological and gastro-intestinal morbidity and is also 
known to be associated with chronic malnutrition in children. In case of
 reduced host immunity, the parasite can cause the 
hyperinfection/dissemination syndrome
        that is invariably fatal if not promptly and properly cured and 
is often fatal despite the treatment. In 2001, delegates at the World Health Assembly unanimously endorsed a
 resolution (WHA54.19) urging endemic countries to start seriously 
tackling worms, specifically schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted 
helminths. The strategy for control of soil-transmitted helminth 
infections is to control morbidity through the periodic treatment of 
at-risk people living in endemic areas. People at risk are: preschool children school-age children women of reproductive age (including pregnant women in the second and third trimesters and breastfeeding women) adults in certain high-risk occupations such as tea-pickers or miners. The WHO recommended medicines –albendazole (400 mg) and mebendazole 
(500 mg) – are effective, inexpensive and easy to administer by 
non-medical personnel (e.g. teachers). They have been through extensive 
safety testing and have
        been used in millions of people with few and minor side-effects. Both
 albendazole and mebendazole are donated to national ministries of 
health through WHO in all endemic countries for the treatment of all 
children of school age. WHO has prequalified two formulations of generic ivermectin, which are available at affordable price in the WHO catalogue . Member States who are in need can make order through WHO.                                                                    ",WHO
In vitro diagnostics,https://www.who.int/health-topics/in-vitro-diagnostics,"In vitro diagnostics (IVDs) are tests that can detect disease, conditions and infections. In vitro simply means ‘in glass’, meaning these tests are typically conducted in test tubes and similar equipment, as opposed to in vivo tests, which are conducted in the body itself. In vitro tests may be done in laboratories, health care facilities or even in the home. The tests themselves can be performed on a variety of instruments ranging from small, handheld tests to complex laboratory instruments. They allow doctors to diagnose patients effectively and work to provide appropriate treatments. Diagnosis is a driver of patient, financial and health systems impact, and a critical enabler of universal health coverage, but it is also the weakest link in the care cascade. This is especially true in primary healthcare settings in low- and middle-income countries. These countries often lack an integrated network of laboratories used for such diagnosis; however, broad set of IVDs is available for testing patients in the primary care setting where laboratories are not available.     Over 40 000 products are available today for in vitro diagnostic testing, covering a wide range of conditions. These include traditional laboratory-based tests, with samples being sent to a central laboratory for analysis, and point-of-care tests, which can be performed near, or at, the point of patient care. Point-of-care testing can help optimize treatment decision-making, avoid referrals, improve the efficiency of care and decrease costs, especially in resource-constrained settings where laboratory infrastructure is weak. Diagnostic tests are increasingly important around the world as a first defence against the spread of many diseases. The fight against tuberculosis, for example, replies on modern diagnostics as a prerequisite for the early, rapid and accurate detection of the disease and changes in drug resistance used in its treatment. In vitro diagnostics are also the first line of defence against the possibility of the re-emergence of eradicated diseases. Smallpox, for example, is unlikely to reappear; however, WHO maintains a network of partnerships around the world dedicated to the rapid diagnosis and containment of any potential cases.        Access to good quality, affordable, and appropriate health products is indispensable to advance universal health coverage, address health emergencies, and promote healthier populations – the three strategic priorities of the World Health Organization (WHO) Thirteenth General Programme of Work 2019–2023. To ensure the quality of diagnosis for priority diseases, the WHO prequalification team evaluates the safety and performance of a number of diagnostic tests according to international standards. Tests found to meet the required criteria are listed on a public web site and eligible for procurement by UN and international procurement agencies. Countries may also use the prequalification list to purchase diagnostics. The WHO procurement service for in vitro diagnostics was established in 1990 to facilitate Member States' access to high quality HIV test kits at a reasonable cost. Over the years, the service has expanded to include diagnostics for HIV/AIDS, malaria, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, as well as basic laboratory consumables and equipment. The WHO also develops and updates the WHO Model List of Essential in vitro Diagnostics (EDL), a list of recommended in vitro diagnostic tests (IVDs) for  point of care in the community and for laboratory,  that should be available in every country. The EDL provides guidance based on the latest evidence, to countries for creating or updating their national lists of essential IVDs.

Healthy diet,https://www.who.int/health-topics/healthy-diet,"A healthy diet is a foundation for health, well-being, optimal growth and development.

high in energy, free sugars, salt, saturated fats and trans fats.             WHO continuously updates the guidance on what constitutes a healthy diet to prevent all forms of malnutrition and promote well-being in different population groups across the life course and on how different nutrients and foods contribute to it. WHO develops evidence-informed guidance on improving the food environment, such as school food and nutrition policies, public food procurement policies, nutrition labelling policies, policies to restricting marketing foods and beverages to children, and fiscal policies (i.e., taxation and subsidies). WHO engages with food manufacturers on improving the nutrition profile of their products. WHO supports Member States in adopting and implementing policies by providing tools such as systems to characterize the nutrient profiles of foods, benchmarks for sodium content in food, manuals on how to implement fiscal policies and marketing restriction policies. WHO regularly monitors the adoption and implementation of food environment policies and their impact on population dietary intake and health.    What constitutes a healthy diet may differ depending on individual needs, locally available foods, dietary customs, cultural norms and other considerations. However, the basic principles of healthy diets remain the same for everyone. The nature of access to food requires broader solutions at the societal level to promote safe and healthy food options. WHO recommends to meet the needs of energy, protein, vitamins and minerals through a varied diet, largely plant based, and balancing energy intake with expenditure; obtaining the largest amount of energy from carbohydrates, mainly through legumes and wholegrain cereals; reducing total fats to less than 30% of total energy intake, shifting fat intake away from saturated and trans fat to unsaturated fats, and eliminating industrial trans fats from the diet; reducing free sugars to less than 10% (ideally 5%) of total energy intake; limiting sodium intake to less than 2 grams per day (equivalent to 5 grams of salt); and consuming at least 400 grams of vegetables and fruit per day in adults and children above 10, and 250–350 grams per day in younger children.

Earthquakes,https://www.who.int/health-topics/earthquakes,"Earthquakes can strike suddenly and without warning. An earthquake is a violent and abrupt shaking of the ground, caused by movement between tectonic plates along a fault line in the earth’s crust. Earthquakes can result in the ground shaking, soil liquefaction, landslides, fissures, avalanches, fires and tsunamis. The extent of destruction and harm caused by an earthquake depends on: magnitude intensity and duration the local geology the time of day that it occurs building and industrial plant design and materials the risk-management measures put in place. Between 1998-2017, earthquakes caused nearly 750 000 deaths globally, more than half of all deaths related to natural disasters. More than 125 million people were affected by earthquakes during this time period, meaning they were injured, made homeless, displaced or evacuated during the emergency phase of the disaster.     Health threats due to earthquakes can vary according the magnitude of the earthquake, the nature of the built environment (such as poor housing or urban slums), and the secondary effects of the earthquake, like tsunamis or landslides. Earthquakes can have immediate and long-term impacts on health. Immediate health impacts include: trauma-related deaths and injuries from building collapse; trauma-related deaths and injuries from the secondary effects of the earthquake, like drowning from tsunamis or burns from fires. Medium-term health impacts include: secondary infection of untreated wounds; increased morbidity and risk of complications related to pregnancy and childbirth due to interrupted obstetric and neonatal services; potential risk of communicable diseases, particularly in areas affected by overcrowding; increased morbidity and risk of complications of chronic diseases due to interruption of treatment; increased psychosocial needs; potential environmental contamination by chemical/radiological agents following destruction of industrial infrastructure. Earthquakes can also damage health facilities and transportation, which can disrupt service delivery and access to care. Health workers may not be able to reach health facilities that are still functional and medical supplies may be lost. As the health cluster lead for global emergencies, WHO works with partners to mitigate, prepare and respond to earthquakes worldwide. This includes: strengthening health emergency risk management systems limiting the risk of exposure to earthquakes by improving the quality of the built environment, with better land-use control, including regulating building ensuring that health facilities are resilient to hazards, and that they are able to remain functional and able to respond to increased and changed health needs after earthquakes, with staff trained appropriately mobilizing medical response teams, including establishing temporary health structures and field hospitals, as well as emergency medical kits investing in community preparedness, as local resident are often      the first responders.

HIV,https://www.who.int/health-topics/hiv-aids,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an infection that attacks the body’s immune system, specifically the white blood cells called CD4 cells. HIV destroys these CD4 cells, weakening a person’s immunity against opportunistic infections, such
    as tuberculosis and fungal infections, severe bacterial infections and some cancers. WHO recommends that every person who may be at risk of HIV should access testing. People at increased risk of acquiring HIV should seek comprehensive and effective HIV prevention, testing and treatment services. HIV infection can be diagnosed using simple and affordable rapid diagnostic tests, as well as self-tests. It is important that HIV testing services follow the 5Cs: consent, confidentiality, counselling, correct results and connection with treatment and
    other services. People diagnosed with HIV should be offered and linked to antiretroviral treatment (ART) as
 soon as possible following diagnosis and periodically monitored using clinical and laboratory parameters, including the test to measure virus in the blood (viral load). If ART is taken consistently, this treatment also prevents HIV transmission to others. At diagnosis or soon after starting ART, a CD4 cell count should be checked to assess a person’s immune status. The CD4 cell count is a blood test used to assess progression of HIV disease, including risk for developing opportunistic infections and guides the use of preventive treatment. The normal range of CD4 count is from 500 to 1500 cells/mm3
    of blood, and it progressively decreases over time in persons who are not receiving or not responding well to ART. If the person’s CD4 cell count falls below 200, their immunity is severely compromised, leaving them susceptible to infections
    and death. Someone with a CD4 count below 200 is described as having an advanced HIV disease (AHD) . HIV viral load measures the amount of virus in the blood. This test is used to monitor the level of viral replication and effectiveness of ART. The treatment goal is to reduce the viral load in the blood to undetectable levels (less than 50 copies/ml),
    and the persistent presence of detectable viral load (greater than 1000 copies/ml) in people living with HIV on ART is an indicator of inadequate treatment response and the need to change or adjust the treatment regimen. WHO’s 2022–2030 global health sector strategy on HIV aims
 to reduce HIV infections from 1.5 million in 2020 to 335 000 by 2030, and deaths from 680 000 in 2020 to under 240 000 in 2030.         Many people do not feel symptoms of HIV in the first few months after infection and may not know that they are infected. Others may experience influenza-like symptoms, including fever, headache, rash and sore throat. However, these first few months are when the virus is most infectious. As the disease progresses, symptoms will be expanded and more pronounced. These can include swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea and cough. HIV weakens the body’s ability to fight other infections, and without treatment people will become more susceptible to other severe illnesses such as tuberculosis , cryptococcal meningitis, bacterial infections and some cancers including lymphomas and Kaposi’s sarcoma. Diagnosis of HIV uses rapid tests that provide same-day results and can  be done at home, although a laboratory test is required to confirm the infection. This early identification greatly improves treatment options and reduces the risk of transmission to other people including sexual or drug-sharing partners. HIV is fully preventable. Effective antiretroviral treatment (ART) prevents HIV transmission from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. Someone who is on antiretroviral therapy and virally suppressed will not pass HIV to their sexual partners. Condoms prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, and prophylaxis use antiretroviral medicines to prevent HIV. Male circumcision is recommended in high-burden countries in eastern and southern Africa. Harm reduction (needle syringe programmes and opioid substitution therapy) prevents HIV and other blood-borne infections for people who inject drugs . HIV is treated with antiretroviral therapy consisting of one or more medicines. ART does not cure HIV but reduces its replication in the blood, thereby reducing the viral load to an undetectable level. ART enables people living with HIV to lead healthy, productive lives. It also works as an effective prevention, reducing the risk of onward transmission by 96% . ART should be taken every day throughout the person’s life. People can continue with safe and effective ART if they adhere to their treatment. In cases when ART becomes ineffective - HIV drug resistance - due to reasons such as lost contact with health care providers and drug stockouts, people will need to switch to other medicines to protect their health.

Contraception,https://www.who.int/health-topics/contraception,"Family planning allows people to attain their desired number of children, if any, and to determine the spacing of their pregnancies. It is achieved through use of contraceptive methods and the treatment of infertility. Contraceptive information and services are fundamental to the health and human rights of all individuals. The prevention of unintended pregnancies helps to lower maternal ill-health and the number of pregnancy-related deaths. Delaying pregnancies in young girls who are at increased risk of health problems from early childbearing, and preventing pregnancies among older women who also face increased risks, are important health benefits of family planning. By reducing rates of unintended pregnancies, contraception also reduces the need for unsafe abortion and reduces HIV transmissions from mothers to newborns. This can also benefit the education of girls and create opportunities for women to participate more fully in society, including paid employment. According to 2023 estimates, 257 million women of reproductive age have an unmet need for contraception. Reasons for this include: limited access to contraception a limited choice of methods a fear or experience of side-effects cultural or religious opposition poor quality of available services gender-based barriers.                                                         It is important that family planning is widely available and easily accessible through trained health workers to anyone who is sexually active, including adolescents. There are many cadres of health care workers who are trained to provide (where authorised) locally available and culturally acceptable contraceptive methods including doctors and midwives. Other trained health workers, for example community health workers,
also provide counselling and some family planning methods, for example pills and condoms. For methods such as sterilization, women and men need to be referred to a clinician. The Sustainable Development Goals set for 2030 will need to ensure that sexual and reproductive health services are widely available and used. This includes supporting contraceptive services through effective government policies and the provision of high-quality
services for individuals. WHO is working to promote contraception by producing evidence-based guidelines on safety and service delivery of contraceptive methods and on ensuring human rights in contraceptive programmes. It is also developing quality standards and providing pre-qualification
of contraceptive commodities. WHO assists countries to adapt and implement these tools to strengthen contraceptive policies and programmes. Additionally, WHO participates in developing new contraceptive technologies to and leads and conducts implementation research for expanding access
to and strengthening delivery contraceptive information and services. There are many different types of contraception, with varying rates of effectiveness depending on correct usage. Some methods may be obtained over the counter, others may require medical advice or even surgical intervention. Health care providers play an important role in helping people find and use a method that is both effective and acceptable. Methods include: Hormonal contraceptive methods Usually oral pills or implants, patches or vaginal rings. They release small amounts of one or more hormones which prevent ovulation. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) Devices inserted into the uterus where they release either a copper component or a small amount of a hormone (Levnorgesterol) to prevent the sperm from reaching the egg. Emergency contraception It is possible to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or if contraception has failed, either with a pill or with an IUD. There is a five-day window for this. Condoms Male condoms sheath a penis. Female condoms fit loosely inside a vagina. Both form a barrier that prevent sperm and egg from meeting. 
Sterilization
Considered a permanent method that blocks sperm in men and eggs in women. Voluntary and informed choice is essential. Lactational amenorrhea method A temporary method of contraception for new mothers whose monthly bleeding has not returned. During this period, eggs are not released and so pregnancy cannot occur.                    ",WHO
Chronic respiratory diseases,https://www.who.int/health-topics/chronic-respiratory-diseases,"Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) affect the airways and other structures of the lungs. Some of the most common are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, occupational lung diseases and pulmonary hypertension. In addition to tobacco smoke, other risk factors include air pollution, occupational chemicals and dusts, and frequent lower respiratory infections during childhood. CRDs are not curable; however, various forms of treatment that help open the air passages and improve shortness of breath can help control symptoms and improve daily  life for people living with these conditions. The WHO Global Alliance against CRDs (GARD) vision is “a world in which all people breathe freely”. GARD focuses on the needs of people with CRDs in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of the WHO Chronic Respiratory Diseases Programme is to support Member States in their efforts to reduce the toll of morbidity, disability and premature mortality related to chronic respiratory diseases, specifically asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.         The two most common chronic respiratory diseases are asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These both affect the airways in the
lungs. Asthma is characterized by recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing
due to airway narrowing, which vary in severity and frequency from person to
person. Symptoms may occur several times in a day or week in affected
individuals, and for some people become worse during physical activity or at
night. Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children. In asthma, the airway obstruction is reversible with inhaled medicines, but
in COPD it is mostly fixed. COPD only affects adults and usually becomes worse
with time. The most common symptoms of COPD are breathlessness or a need for
air, sputum production and a chronic cough. Risk factors for chronic respiratory diseases include tobacco smoking
(including second-hand smoke), air pollution, allergens and occupational risks.
Outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution (often caused by cooking with
solid fuels) are also common causes. Asthma and COPD may be prevented by reducing or avoiding exposure to these
risk factors.                             Neither asthma nor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be cured
but treatment can reduce symptoms, prevent deterioration and improve daily life. During attacks of breathlessness caused by airway narrowing, inhaled
medicines (bronchodilators) can open the airways and relieve symptoms. If
untreated, severe attacks can lead to death. Appropriate management of asthma with inhaled corticosteroid medicine can
control the progression of the disease and reduce deaths. Long-term treatment
is required for people with persistent symptoms and exposures which trigger
symptoms (e.g. smoke, fumes, dust, grass and tree pollen, animal fur and
feathers) should be avoided. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is confirmed by a spirometry test,
which measures how much and how quickly a person can blow air out of their
lungs. Symptoms can be treated through medical and physical treatments;
however, with COPD in people who smoke tobacco, the most effective treatment
available is to stop smoking. This can slow down the progression of the disease
and decrease COPD-related deaths. In specific cases, people may benefit from using
inhaled corticosteroid medicines.                                        ",WHO
Climate change,https://www.who.int/health-topics/climate-change,"Climate change is impacting human lives and health in a variety of ways. It threatens the essential ingredients of good health – clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food supply and safe shelter – and has the potential to undermine decades of progress in global health. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress alone. The direct damage costs to health are estimated to be between US$ 2–4 billion per year by 2030. Areas with weak health infrastructure – mostly in developing countries – will be the least able to cope without assistance to prepare and respond. Greenhouse gas emissions that result from the extraction and burning of fossil fuels are major contributors to both climate change and air pollution. Many policies and individual measures, such as transport, food and energy use choices, have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and produce major health co-benefits, particularly by abating air pollution. The phase out of polluting energy systems, for example, or the promotion of public transportation and active movement, could both lower carbon emissions and cut the burden of household and ambient air pollution, which cause 7 million premature deaths per year     Climate change is already impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues. Furthermore, climate change is undermining many of the social determinants for good health, such as livelihoods, equality and access to health care and social support structures. These climate-sensitive health risks are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, including women, children, ethnic minorities, poor communities, migrants or displaced persons, older populations and those with underlying health conditions. In the short to medium term, the health impacts of climate change will be determined mainly by the vulnerability of populations, their resilience to the current rate of climate change and the extent and pace of adaptation. In the longer term, the effects will increasingly depend on the extent to which transformational action is taken now to reduce emissions and avoid the breaching of dangerous temperature thresholds and potential irreversible tipping points. WHO supports countries in building climate-resilient health systems and tracking national progress in protecting health from climate change, as well as in assessing the health gains that would result from the implementation of the existing Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement, and the potential for larger gains from more ambitious climate action. WHO’s work plan on climate change and health includes: advocacy and partnerships: coordinating with partner agencies within the UN system, and ensuring that health is properly represented in the climate change agenda, as well as providing and disseminating information on the threats that climate change presents to human health and opportunities to promote health while cutting carbon emissions; monitoring science and evidence: coordinating reviews of the scientific evidence on the links between climate change and health; assessing country's preparedness and needs when facing climate change; and developing a global research agenda; supporting countries to protect human health from climate change: strengthening national capacities and improving the resilience and adaptive capacity of health systems to deal with the adverse health effects of climate change; and building capacity on climate change and human health: assisting countries to build capacity to reduce health vulnerability to climate change and promoting health while reducing carbon emissions.

Antimicrobial resistance,https://www.who.int/health-topics/antimicrobial-resistance,"Antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing
range of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi. AMR occurs when
bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change over time and no longer respond
to medicines making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of
disease spread, severe illness and death. As a result, the medicines become
ineffective and infections persist in the body, increasing the risk of spread
to others. Antimicrobials -
including antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and antiparasitics - are

Typhoid,https://www.who.int/health-topics/typhoid,"Typhoid fever is a life-threatening systemic infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (commonly known as Salmonella Typhi). Typhoid is usually spread through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Typhoid occurs predominantly in association with poor sanitation and lack of clean drinking water, in both urban and rural settings. However, urbanization, with associated overcrowded populations and inadequate water and sanitation systems, as well as climate change have the potential to further increase the global burden of typhoid. In addition, increasing antibiotic resistance is making it easier for typhoid to spread and more difficult to be treated. An estimated 9 million people get sick from typhoid and 110 000 people die from it worldwide every year (2019 figures). Children and populations lacking access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation are at highest risk. Travellers are at risk of developing typhoid fever in many typhoid endemic countries, particularly in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Elsewhere, travellers are usually at risk when exposed to low standards of personal hygiene or food hygiene and poor water quality. Even vaccinated travellers should take care to avoid consumption of potentially contaminated food and water as vaccination does not confer 100% protection.                   Salmonella Typhi lives only in humans. In persons with typhoid fever the bacteria enter through the intestinal tract and eventually invade the bloodstream. The resulting illness is often clinically non-distinguishable from other febrile illnesses. Symptoms include: prolonged high fever fatigue headache nausea abdominal pain constipation or diarrhoea rash, in some cases. Severe cases may lead to serious complications or even death. Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics. However, increased resistance to antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones and newer antibiotics such as cephalosporins and azithromycin, as well as the emergence of extensively drug resistant strains of Salmonella Typhi leads to more complicated and expensive treatment options in the most affected regions. Even after symptoms pass, approximately 2–5% of cases become chronic carriers and inadvertently spread typhoid through ongoing faecal shedding of the bacteria and contamination. It is important for people being treated for typhoid fever to do the following: take prescribed antibiotics for      the full prescribed course; wash their hands with soap and      water after using the bathroom, and avoid preparing or serving food to      other people, whilst the infection persists; and have their doctor test (after      the antibiotic course) to ensure that no Salmonella Typhi bacteria remain in their body. Access to safe water and adequate sanitation, health education, appropriate hygiene among food handlers, and typhoid vaccination are all effective strategies for prevention and control of typhoid. There are three recommended typhoid vaccines : typhoid conjugate vaccine, an injectable vaccine for children from 6 months of age and adults up to 65 years; unconjugated Vi polysaccharide vaccine, an injectable vaccine for people over 2 years; and live attenuated oral vaccine, suitable for people over the age of 6 years. Typhoid conjugate vaccine has been recommended for routine use as a single dose in childhood immunization programmes since October 2017. The latter two vaccines have been used for many years in older children and adults at risk of typhoid, including travellers; they do not provide long-lasting immunity and require multiple doses to maintain protection. Since December 2017, WHO has prequalified two typhoid conjugate vaccines, which are prioritized for introduction in endemic countries with high burden of typhoid or high levels of antimicrobial resistance. Widespread use of the conjugate vaccine in priority countries is expected to help reduce the frequent use of antibiotics for typhoid treatment and slow the increase in antibiotic resistance in Salmonella Typhi .

Noncommunicable diseases,https://www.who.int/health-topics/noncommunicable-diseases,"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease, are collectively responsible for 74% of all deaths worldwide. More than three-quarters of all NCD deaths, and 86% of the 17 million people who died prematurely, or before reaching 70 years of age, occur in low- and middle-income countries. NCDs share five major risk factors: tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diets and air pollution. The epidemic of NCDs poses devastating health consequences for individuals, families and communities, and threatens to overwhelm health systems. The socioeconomic costs associated with NCDs make the prevention and control of these diseases a major development imperative for the 21st century. WHO’s mission is to provide leadership and the evidence base for international action on surveillance, prevention and control of NCDs. Urgent government action is needed to meet global targets to reduce the burden of NCDs.             The WHO Department of Noncommunicable Diseases is responsible for global leadership, coordination, guidance and technical support to reduce premature mortality and morbidity from NCDs. In 2019, the World Health Assembly extended the WHO Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013–2020 to 2030. It called for the development of an Implementation Roadmap 2023–2030 to accelerate progress on preventing and controlling NCDs. The Implementation Roadmap supports actions to achieve a set of  9 global targets with the greatest impact towards prevention and management of NCDs. Noncommunicable diseases are recognized as a major global challenge in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Agenda sets the target of reducing premature deaths from NCDs by one third by 2030. WHO plays a key leadership role in the coordination and promotion of the global fight against NCDs and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals target 3.4.       One of the most important ways of reducing deaths from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is to control the risk factors that lead to their development. These include reducing the use of tobacco and the harmful use of alcohol, maintaining an active lifestyle and consuming a healthy diet, and improving air quality. Actions towards these goals are cost-effective ways for countries to reduce the number of NCD deaths. Tackling these risk factors can not only save lives, but also provide a huge economic boost for countries. Beyond prevention, management of NCDs is critical. This includes detection, screening and treatment of the diseases, as well as palliative care for those in need. The vast majority of premature deaths from NCDs occur in low- and middle-income countries, where universal health coverage or access to health care services is often limited. The development and promotion of universal health coverage is therefore essential in tackling NCDs and working to reduce the number of preventable global deaths. Surveillance of NCDs is another vital action for providing the information needed for policy and programme development for NCD prevention and control. Tracking and reporting on NCD related global targets and indicators to understand progress in NCD prevention and control are key activities. Accurate data from countries are vital to reverse the global rise in death and disability from NCDs, to support evidence-based decision making, and to help monitor and evaluate the progress being made.

Volcanic eruptions,https://www.who.int/health-topics/volcanic-eruptions,"A volcano is a vent in the Earth’s crust from which eruptions occur. There are about 1500 potentially active volcanoes worldwide. When volcanoes erupt they can spew hot, dangerous gases, ash, lava and rock that can cause disastrous loss of life and property, especially in heavily populated areas. Volcanic activities and wildfires affected 6.2 million people and caused nearly 2400 deaths between 1998-2017. There are different types of volcanic eruptive events, including: pyroclastic explosions, with is fast-moving hot gas and volcanic matter hot ash releases lava flows gas emissions glowing avalanches, when gas and ashes release. Volcanic eruptions can also cause secondary events, such as floods, landslides and mudslides, if there are accompanying rain, snow or melting ice. Hot ashes can also start wildfires. Volcanic eruptions can impact climate change through emitting volcanic gases like sulfur dioxide, which causes global cooling, and volcanic carbon dioxide, which has the potential to promote global warming.     Volcanic eruptions can pose multiple health threats depending on the proximity of the volcano to the community and whether there was any warning. Volcanic eruptions can cause: suffocation infectious diseases, such as conjunctivitis acute and chronic respiratory diseases from falling ash and breathing gases and fumes burns and traumatic injuries, such as lacerations from falling rock eye and skin irritations from acid rain. Ash and chemicals from the eruption can also generate risk of food and water contamination, and compromise basic services, like water, transportation, communications and health services. Likewise, the accumulation of ash on roofs can cause damage or collapse of buildings, both immediately and after the event. WHO works with Member States to build resilient and proactive health systems that can anticipate the needs and challenges during emergencies so that they are more likely to reduce risks and respond effectively when needed. The magnitude of the physical and human costs from volcanoes can be reduced if adequate emergency prevention, preparedness, response and recovery measures are implemented in a sustainable and timely manner. This includes, ensuring early warning systems are in place, evaluating the population, and raises awareness about the risks of volcanic activities. As the health cluster lead for global emergencies, WHO works with partners to respond to: ensure appropriate food supplementation; restore primary care services, like immunization, child and maternal health, and mental health; assemble mobile health teams and outreach; conduct epidemic surveillance, early warning and response; call for emergency funding to support health action.

Poliomyelitis (polio),https://www.who.int/health-topics/poliomyelitis,"Poliomyelitis (polio) is a highly infectious viral disease that largely affects children under 5 years of age. The virus is transmitted by person-to-person spread mainly through the faecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (e.g. contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis. In 1988, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution for the worldwide eradication of polio, marking the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative , spearheaded by national governments, WHO, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), UNICEF, and later joined by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Wild poliovirus cases have decreased by over 99% since 1988, from an estimated 350 000 cases in more than 125 endemic countries to 6 reported cases in 2021. Of the 3 strains of wild poliovirus (type 1, type 2 and type 3), wild poliovirus type 2 was eradicated in 1999 and wild poliovirus type 3 was eradicated in 2020. As at 2022, endemic wild poliovirus type 1 remains in two countries:  Pakistan and Afghanistan.         Poliovirus is highly infectious. The incubation period is usually 7–10 days but can range from 4–35 days. The virus enters the body through the mouth and multiplies in the intestine.  It then invades the nervous system. Up to 90% of those infected experience no or mild symptoms and the disease usually goes unrecognized. In others, initial symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness in the neck, and pain in the limbs. These symptoms usually last for 2–10 days and most recovery is complete in almost all cases.  However, in the remaining proportion of cases the virus causes paralysis, usually of the legs, which is most often permanent.  Paralysis can occur as rapidly as within a few hours of infection. Of those paralysed, 5-10% die when their breathing muscles become immobilized. The virus is shed by infected people (usually children) through faeces, where it can spread quickly, especially in areas with poor hygiene and sanitation systems. There is no cure for polio; it can only be prevented by immunization. The polio vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life. More than 20 million people are able to walk today who would otherwise have been paralysed, since 1988, when the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched. An estimated 1.5 million childhood deaths have been prevented through the systematic administration of vitamin A during polio immunization activities. Treatments for polio focus on limiting and alleviating symptoms. Heat and physical therapy can be used to stimulate the muscles and antispasmodic drugs are used to relax the effected muscles. This can improve mobility but does not reverse permanent polio paralysis. Vaccination is crucial in the fight against polio. Failure to implement strategic approaches leads to ongoing transmission of the virus. Endemic transmission of wild poliovirus is continuing to cause cases in border areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Failure to stop polio in these last remaining areas could result in as many as 200 000 new cases every year within 10 years, all over the world. That is why it is critical to ensure polio is eradicated completely, once and for all.                                                                    ",WHO
Drought,https://www.who.int/health-topics/drought,"Drought is a prolonged dry period in the natural climate cycle that can occur anywhere in the world. It is a slow-onset disaster characterized by the lack of precipitation, resulting in a water shortage. Drought can have a serious impact on health, agriculture, economies, energy and the environment. An estimated 55 million people globally are affected by droughts every year, and they are the most serious hazard to livestock and crops in nearly every part of the world. Drought threatens people’s livelihoods, increases the risk of disease and death, and fuels mass migration. Water scarcity impacts 40% of the world’s population, and as many as 700 million people are at-risk of being displaced as a result of drought by 2030. Rising temperatures caused by climate change are making already dry regions drier and wet regions wetter. In dry regions, this means that when temperatures rise, water evaporates more quickly, and thus increases the risk of drought or prolongs periods of drought. Between 80-90% of all documented disasters from natural hazards during the past 10 years have resulted from floods, droughts, tropical cyclones, heat waves and severe storms.     When drought causes water and food shortages there can be many impacts on the health of the affected population, which may increase the risk of disease and death. Drought may have acute and  chronic health effects, including: malnutrition due to the decreased availability of food, including micronutrient deficiency, such as iron-deficiency anaemia; increased risk of infectious diseases, such as cholera, diarrhoea, and pneumonia, due to acute malnutrition, lack of water and sanitation, and displacement; psycho-social stress and mental health disorders; disruption of local health services due to a lack of water supplies, loss of buying power, migration and/or health workers being forced to leave local areas. Severe drought can also affect air quality by making wildfires and dust storms more likely, increasing health risk in people already impacted by lung diseases, like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or with heart disease. As the health cluster lead for global emergencies, WHO works with Member States and partners to respond to drought-related disasters. This includes calling for and coordinating emergency funding to support health actions and assembling mobile heath
        teams and outreach. WHO also works to ensure appropriate food supplementation is available to the affected areas, as well as support for child, maternal and mental health services. Drought can be a catalyst for outbreaks of other diseases due to reduced water for drinking, cooking and sanitation, and strains on food resources. WHO works to provide epidemic surveillance, early warning and response programs and preventative immunization
        efforts to mitigate the effects of disease in drought-stricken areas. Food production is particularly at risk from drought, the implications of which can last long after the drought itself is over. Droughts can also cause large numbers
    of people to become refugees in neighbouring areas or countries, which stretches the resources of the host area. WHO works to reduce the impacts of these effects through coordination with aid agencies and governments.                                                                        ",WHO
Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis),https://www.who.int/health-topics/chagas-disease,"Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi . An estimated 6 to 7 million people worldwide are  infected with T. cruzi . Chagas disease is found mainly in endemic areas of 21 continental Latin American countries , where it is mostly transmitted when humans come into contact with faeces and/or urine of infected blood-sucking triatomine bugs (vector-borne transmission). Chagas disease was once entirely confined to the Region of the Americas. In the last decades the epidemiological pattern of the disease  changed from a rural to a mostly urban disease, mainly due to population mobility, urbanization and emigration. As a consequence, increased  number of cases have been detected in Canada and the United States of America, and in many European and some African, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific countries. Due to the high number of people who remain undiagnosed or untreated, combined with the areas with remaining active transmission, put an estimated 75 million people at risk of infection. Triatomine bugs typically live in the wall or roof cracks of poorly constructed homes in rural or suburban areas, becoming active at night, biting exposed areas of skin, then defecating close to the bite. The parasites enter the body when: i) the person inadvertently smears the bug’s waste into the bite or another skin break, the eyes or the mouth; ii) by consumption of food that has been contaminated with waste from infected triatomine bugs, typically infecting groups of people (causing outbreaks or oral transmission) with a higher frequency of severe disease and number of deaths. Everywhere Chagas disease can be also transmitted through blood or blood product transfusion from infected donors; by congenital (mother to child) transmission during pregnancy or childbirth; by organ transplantation from infected donors; and also by laboratory accidents. In May 2019, following up on decision of the 72 n d World Health Assembly, the World Chagas Disease Day was established to be celebrated on 14 April (the date of the year 1909 when Carlos Chagas diagnosed the first human case of the disease, a two-year-old girl called Berenice).         After the infection is transmitted there is an initial, acute phase that lasts for about two months. In most cases, symptoms are absent or mild and unspecific. In people bitten by a triatomine bug, characteristic first visible signs of infection, such as a skin lesion or a purplish swelling of the lids of one eye (the so-called Romaña sign), can help in the diagnosis of new cases. With any transmission route, patients can present fever, headache, enlarged lymph glands, pallor, muscle pain, difficulty in breathing, swelling, and abdominal or chest pain. During the chronic phase that succeeds the acute phase, up to 30% of patients suffer from cardiac disorders and up to 10% experience digestive, neurological or mixed disorders. In later years, the infection can lead to sudden death principally due to heart arrhythmia or heart failure caused by the destruction of the heart muscle and its nervous system. Chagas disease can be treated with two antiparasitic medicines: benznidazole and nifurtimox. Both medicines are nearly 100% effective in curing the disease if given soon after infection, including the cases of congenital transmission. The efficacy of both diminishes, however, the longer a person has been infected and the adverse reactions are more frequent at older age. Treatment is also indicated for those in whom the infection has been reactivated due to immunosuppression, and for patients during the early chronic phase. Infected adults, especially those with no symptoms, should be offered treatment because antiparasitic treatment can also prevent or curb disease progression and prevent congenital transmission in pregnant women. In other cases the potential benefits of medication in preventing or delaying the development of Chagas disease should be weighed against the duration of treatment (up to 2 months) and possible adverse reactions (occurring in up to 40% of treated adult patients). Benznidazole and nifurtimox should not be taken by pregnant women or by people with kidney or liver failure. Nifurtimox is also contraindicated for people with a background of neurological or psychiatric disorders. Additionally, specific treatment for cardiac, or digestive or neurological manifestations may be required.                                                                    ",WHO
Rehabilitation,https://www.who.int/health-topics/rehabilitation,"Rehabilitation addresses the impact of a health condition
on a person’s everyday life by optimizing their functioning and reducing their
experience of disability. Rehabilitation expands the focus of health beyond
preventative and curative care to ensure people with a health condition can
remain as independent as possible and participate in education, work and
meaningful life roles. Anyone may need rehabilitation at some point in their
lives, whether they have experienced an injury, disease, illness, or because
their functioning has declined with age. Globally, 1 in 3 people today are estimated to be living
with a health condition that would benefit from rehabilitation. This need is
predicted to increase in the coming years due to changes in the health and characteristics
of the population. For example, people are living longer but with more chronic
disease and disability. Emergencies, including conflicts, disasters and
outbreaks can all create surges in rehabilitation needs. Globally, many people
are living with mid- and long-term consequences of COVID-19 and may be in need
of rehabilitation to support their recovery from the disease.     Although the need for rehabilitation is increasing
globally, many countries are unequipped to respond to existing needs. In some
low- and middle-income countries, more than 50% of people do not receive the
rehabilitation services they require. Rehabilitation services are often under
funded and under valued, particularly in countries without strong health
systems. Rehabilitation helps to reduce the impacts of disease and
injury on individuals, while also complimenting other health interventions. This
means it can be seen as an investment in health care costs because it can lower
long term reliance on health systems through reducing hospitalization, shortening
hospital stays and preventing readmissions. The investment pays off further by enabling
people to return to work, education and other pursuits more quickly following the
health issue. Rehabilitation is a neglected but essential part of emergency
response and long-term recovery. Emergencies disproportionately effect weaker
health systems and the most vulnerable, but early and ongoing access to
rehabilitation reduces complications, optimizes functioning and reduces
disability in those affected, supporting individuals, families and communities
in their recovery.        WHO views rehabilitation as an essential part of achieving both
universal health coverage and goal 3 of the Sustainable Development Goals . To
this end, WHO works to make rehabilitation part of health care at all levels
through efforts to strengthen health systems as a whole. In 2017 WHO launched the Rehabilitation 2030
initiative , which emphasizes the need for concerted and coordinated action
by all stakeholders to strengthen the health system to provide quality and
timely rehabilitation. This occurs through actions such as improving leadership
and governance; developing a strong multidisciplinary rehabilitation workforce;
expanding financing for rehabilitation; and improving data collection and
research on rehabilitation. In emergencies, we are developing tools to help
strengthen rehabilitation preparedness, while also working to better integrate
rehabilitation into responses. WHO continues to support countries to implement these
actions through providing technical support, developing guidance and practical
tools, and increasing the development of robust evidence for rehabilitation. These
efforts focus both on local and national health systems, as well as responses
to emergencies to ensure rehabilitation services are available to anyone who
needs them.                                                                 ",WHO
Blood transfusion safety,https://www.who.int/health-topics/blood-transfusion-safety,"Nearly 120 million units of blood are donated every year. However, this is not sufficient to meet the global need many patients requiring a transfusion do not have timely access to safe blood. Blood cannot be stored indefinitely, meaning there is a constant need for donations. Regular donations are required to ensure there is always a supply for those in need. Despite global need, donation rates differ around the world and some high-income countries see up to seven times more donations than low-income countries. Blood transfusions are needed for a wide range of health conditions including anaemia, complications during pregnancy and childbirth, severe trauma due to accidents, and surgical procedures. They are also regularly used for patients with conditions such as sickle cell disease and thalassaemia and for products to treat haemophilia. Maintaining safe and effective procedures around the collection, storage and use of donated blood is essential. Collectively called haemovigilance, these procedures cover the entire blood transfusion chain and are used to standardize the use of blood in healthcare.                                                           Donated blood is used in many ways beyond whole blood transfusions. Processing can convert it into plasma, red cell concentrates, platelet concentrates and more, with each used for specific cases in health-care delivery. In some cases, this allows a unit of donated blood to meet the needs of more than one patient and is an important aspect of the transfusion train. However, not all countries have facilities to process blood in this way, and only 50 of 173 reporting countries produce plasma-derived medicinal products domestically. The world’s blood supply comes through over 12 000 blood centres and is donated by three types of people: unpaid volunteers, family members of patients and paid donors. WHO advocates the development of national blood systems based on unpaid volunteers because that group tends to have fewer bloodborne infections. Despite this, many countries continue to receive less than half of blood donations from unpaid volunteers, with much of their blood supply dependent on family donations and paid donors. The unavailability of timely, safe blood transfusions has led to many otherwise avoidable deaths. A consistent supply of blood is a cornerstone of any health-care system, but this relies on regular donations and effective health-care infrastructure. Huge gaps exist between low-, middle- and high-income countries regarding blood donation. Of the nearly 120 million units of blood donated each year around the world, 42% are in high-income countries, where just 16% of the global population lives. However, more young people donate in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Compounding insufficient collection rates is the inability of many health-care systems to adequately screen donated blood for diseases such as HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis according to quality system requirements. The inability to test blood can be due in part to the irregular supply of testing kits, particularly in low-income areas. Inadequate testing contributes to the spread of transfusion-transmissible infections, which can compromise the patient’s wellbeing and further strain health-care systems.                  ",WHO
Diarrhoea,https://www.who.int/health-topics/diarrhoea,"Diarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of death in children under five years old, and was responsible for the deaths of 370,000  children in 2019. The most severe threat posed by diarrhoea is dehydration. During an episode of diarrhoea, water and electrolytes including sodium, chloride, potassium and bicarbonate are lost through liquid stools, vomit, sweat, urine and breathing. A person with diarrhoea becomes dehydrated when these losses are not replaced. In addition, diarrhoea is a major cause of malnutrition, making the person more susceptible to future bouts of diarrhoea and to other diseases. There are three clinical types of diarrhoea, each with its specific treatments: Acute watery diarrhoea, which may last several hours or days, and includes      cholera. Acute bloody diarrhoea, also called dysentery. Persistent diarrhoea, lasting 14 days or longer. In the past, for most children, severe dehydration and fluid loss were the main causes of dying from diarrhoea. Now, other causes such as septic bacterial infections are likely to account for an increasing proportion of all diarrhoea-associated deaths. Exclusive breastfeeding is protective and prevents diarrhoea from occurring in young children. Breastfeeding also reduces the severity of diarrhoea. Innovative activities and demand creation are important for achieving behaviour change and sustaining long-term preventive practices to combat preventable morbidity and mortality from diarrhoeal diseases.         Diarrhoea is the passage of 3 or more loose or liquid stools per day, or more frequently than is normal for the individual. It is usually a symptom of gastrointestinal infection, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water, or from person to person as a result of poor hygiene. Key measures to prevent diarrhoea include the following: access to safe drinking-water. use of improved sanitation. hand washing with soap. exclusive breastfeeding for the first      six months of life. good personal and food hygiene. health education about how      infections spread. rotavirus vaccination. Key measures to treat diarrhoea include the following: Rehydration with oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution: ORS, particularly the low osmolarity formula, are a proven      life-saving commodity for the treatment of children with diarrhoea. Rehydration may require intravenous fluids in case of severe dehydration or shock. Zinc supplements reduce      the duration of a diarrhoea episode by 25% and are associated with a 30%      reduction in stool volume. Nutrient-rich foods: the      vicious circle of malnutrition and diarrhoea can be broken by continuing to give nutrient-rich foods – including breast milk – during an episode, and by giving a nutritious      diet – including exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life      – to children when they are well. Consulting a health professional , in      particular for management of persistent diarrhoea, or when there is blood      in the stool, or if there are signs of dehydration. Adequate nutrition is key to improving natural defenses, starting with exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life.

Neglected tropical diseases,https://www.who.int/health-topics/neglected-tropical-diseases,"Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of conditions 1 caused by a variety of pathogens (including viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi and toxins) and associated with devastating health, social and economic consequences. NTDs are mainly prevalent among impoverished communities in tropical areas, although some have a much larger geographical distribution. It is estimated that NTDs affect more than 1 billion people, while the number of people requiring NTD interventions (both preventive and curative) is 1.6 billion. The epidemiology of NTDs is complex and often related to environmental conditions. Many of them are vector-borne, have animal reservoirs and are associated with complex life cycles. All these factors make their public-health control challenging. ------------------------------------- 1. NTDs include: Buruli ulcer; Chagas disease; dengue and chikungunya; dracunculiasis; echinococcosis; foodborne trematodiases; human African trypanosomiasis; leishmaniasis; leprosy; lymphatic filariasis; mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis and other deep mycoses; noma; onchocerciasis; rabies; scabies and other ectoparasitoses; schistosomiasis; soil-transmitted helminthiases; snakebite envenoming; taeniasis/cysticercosis; trachoma; and yaws.     WHO estimates that over 1.6 billion of the world’s population should be targeted by prevention and treatment activities for at least one of these diseases, every year. In addition to significant mortality and morbidity - approximately 200,000 deaths and 19 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost annually, NTDs cost developing communities the equivalent of billions of United States dollars each year in direct health costs, loss of productivity and reduced socioeconomic and educational attainment. They are also responsible for other consequences such as disability, stigmatization, social exclusion and discrimination and place considerable financial strain on patients and their families. In spite of this, NTDs have historically ranked very low and almost absent from the global health policy agenda – only to gain recognition in 2015 with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG target 3.3). SDG3 can therefore be achieved only if the NTD goals are met but, because interventions to tackle NTDs are widely cross-sectoral, increasing their global prioritization can in fact catalyze progress to achieve all SDGs.        WHO’s action to control, prevent, eliminate and eradicate NTDs is guided by the NTD road map for 2021-2030 , that moves away from vertical disease programmes to integrated cross-cutting approaches. The aim is to facilitate the coordinated scale-up of key interventions through public health approaches such as preventive chemotherapy, individual case management, vector control, veterinary public health and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). The overarching 2030 global targets include a 90% reduction in the number of people requiring treatment for NTDs; a 75% reduction in DALYs related to NTDs; at least 100 countries eliminating at least one NTD; and the eradication of two diseases (dracunculiasis and yaws). Additional cross-cutting targets focus on integrated approaches, multisectoral coordination, universal health coverage and country ownership, while a further set of targets has been devised to measure progress against each disease.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19),https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance. The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell. Stay informed: Advice for the public Myth busters Questions and answers Situation reports All information on the COVID-19 outbreak         COVID-19 affects different people in different ways.

Less common symptoms: sore throat headache aches and pains diarrhoea a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes red or irritated eyes. Serious symptoms: difficulty breathing or shortness of breath loss of speech or mobility, or confusion chest pain. Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms.  Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility. People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home. On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.     To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following: Get vaccinated when a vaccine is available to you. Stay at least 1 metre apart from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick. Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible or when in poorly ventilated settings.

Population growth, rapid urbanization, environmental degradation, and the misuse of antimicrobials are disrupting the equilibrium of the microbial world. New diseases, like COVID-19, are emerging at unprecedented rates disrupting people’s health
        and causing social and economic impacts. Billions of passengers travel on airplanes each year, increasing the opportunities for the rapid international spread of infectious agents and their vectors. Dependence on chemicals has increased, as has awareness of the potential hazards for health and the environment, like climate change and air pollution. As the globalization of food production increases, so does the risk of tainted ingredients and
        risk of foodborne diseases. As the world’s population becomes more mobile and increases its economic interdependence, these global health threat increase and traditional defences at national borders cannot protect against the invasion of

Road traffic injuries,https://www.who.int/health-topics/road-safety,"Road traffic crashes result in the deaths of approximately 1.19 million people around the world each year and leave between 20 and 50 million people with non-fatal injuries. More than half of all road traffic deaths occur among vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists. Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5–29. Yet two thirds of road traffic fatalities occur among people of working age (18–59 years). Nine in 10 fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these countries have around 60% of the world's vehicles. In addition to the human suffering caused by road traffic injuries, they also incur a heavy economic burden on victims and their families, both through treatment costs for the injured and through loss of productivity of those killed or disabled. More broadly, road traffic injuries have a serious impact on national economies, costing countries 3% of their annual gross domestic product. Measures proven to reduce the risk of road traffic injuries and deaths exist and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has set an ambitious target of reducing road traffic deaths and injuries by 50% by 2030.             WHO works with Member States and partners to support road safety evaluation, implementation and planning. As the lead agency for road safety in the United Nations, WHO plays a key role in guiding global efforts by advocating for road safety at the highest political levels, compiling and sharing good practices and raising awareness of road safety. WHO serves as the secretariat for the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021–2030 which aims to reduce road traffic deaths and injuries by at least 50% by 2030. This includes convening a global network of Heads of National Road Safety Agencies, producing Global Status Reports to track progress, and providing technical assistance. WHO works with a range of partners to provide technical support to countries and works with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to share knowledge, experience and best practices. WHO chairs the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration, and organizes and hosts, with key partners, high profile advocacy events such as UN road safety weeks and the annual World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims.                                                Many factors increase both the risk of road traffic crashes and the risk of death or injury they result in. Driving at higher speed significantly increases both the likelihood of a crash occurring and the severity of its consequences. For every 1% increase in mean speed there is a 4% increase in fatal crash risk. The risk of death for pedestrians hit by motorized vehicles also rises rapidly as speed increases. A pedestrian hit by a vehicle travelling at 65 kilometres per hour is 4.5 times more likely to die than those hit by a vehicle travelling at 50 kilometres per hour. Driving under the influence of alcohol or other psychoactive substances presents significant risk factor for road traffic injuries. In the case of drink-driving, risk of road traffic injury increases significantly as the driver’s blood alcohol concentration goes up. In the case of drug-driving, the risk of road traffic injury increases to differing degrees depending on the psychoactive drug used. There are a number of other significant risk factors: the non-use of motorcycle helmets, seat-belts and child restraints distraction, including the use of mobile phones, leading to impaired driving unsafe vehicles and unsafe road infrastructure inadequate post-crash care inadequate enforcement of traffic laws.

Dracunculiasis (Guinea-worm disease),https://www.who.int/health-topics/dracunculiasis,"Guinea-worm disease is caused by the parasitic worm Dracunculus medinensis or Guinea-worm. This worm is the largest of the tissue parasite affecting humans. The adult female, which carries about 3 million embryos, can measure
    600 to 800 mm in length and 2 mm in diameter. When a person drinks contaminated water from ponds or shallow open wells, the cyclops is dissolved by the gastric acid of the stomach and the larvae are released and migrate through the intestinal wall. After 100 days, the male and female meet and mate. The male becomes encapsulated and dies in the tissues while the female moves down the muscle planes. After about one year of the infection, the female worm emerges, usually from the feet, releasing thousands
    of larvae and thus repeating the life cycle.         Guinea-worm disease is rarely fatal. Frequently, however, the patient remains sick for several months, mainly because: The emergence of the worm, sometimes several, is accompanied by painful oedema, intense generalised pruritus, blistering and an ulceration of the area from which the worm emerges; The migration and emergence of the worms occur in sensitive parts of the body, sometimes the articular spaces can lead to permanent disability; Ulcers caused by the emergence of the worm invariably develop secondary bacterial infections which exacerbate inflammation and pain resulting in temporary disability; and Accidental rupture of the worm in the tissue spaces can result in serious allergic reactions. The epidemiology of the disease is determined largely by the use of open stagnant water sources such as ponds and sometimes shallow or step wells. Human-made ponds are the main source of transmission. Guinea-worm disease is seasonal, occurring with two broad patterns found in endemic areas of Africa, depending on climatic factors. In the Sahelian zone, transmission generally occurs in the rainy season (May to August). In the humid savanna and forest zone, the peak occurs in the dry season (September to January). No drug is available to prevent or heal this parasitic disease. Dracunculiasis is, however, relatively easy to eliminate and eventually eradicate. Guinea-worm disease is a vulnerable disease: humans alone are responsible for maintaining its fragile transmission cycle. It is therefore possible to permanently curtail transmission by applying the following measures: Effective surveillance to detect all cases within 24 hours of worm emergence and containment of all cases; Ensuring access to safe drinking water and converting unsafe sources to safe ones; The construction of copings around well heads or the installation of boreholes with handpumps. This would prevent not only dracunculiasis but also diarrhoeal diseases; Regular and systematic filtering of drinking water derived from ponds and shallow unprotected wells or from surface water.

Clinical trials,https://www.who.int/health-topics/clinical-trials,"Clinical trials are a type of research that studies new tests and treatments and evaluates their effects on human health outcomes. People volunteer to take part in clinical trials to test medical interventions including drugs, cells and other biological products, surgical procedures, radiological procedures, devices, behavioural treatments and preventive care. Clinical trials are carefully designed, reviewed and completed, and need to be approved before they can start. People of all ages can take part in clinical trials, including children. There are 4 phases of biomedical clinical trials: Phase I studies usually test new drugs for the first time in a small group of people to evaluate a safe dosage range and identify side effects. Phase II studies test treatments that have been found to be safe in phase I but now need a larger group of human subjects to monitor for any adverse effects. Phase III studies are conducted on larger populations and in different regions and countries, and are often the step right before a new treatment is approved. Phase IV studies take place after country approval and there is a need for further testing in a wide population over a longer timeframe.      Clinical trials usually involve participants from more than one medical or research institution, and often more than one country. As each country has its own requirements for clinical trials research it is possible that single trials could be included on more than one registry, and hence appear on more than one registry database. However, data on various clinical trial registries varies. WHO’s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) links clinical trials registers globally in order to ensure a single point of access and the unambiguous identification of trials with a view to enhancing access to information by patients, families, patient groups and others. The ICTRP is a global initiative that aims to make information about all clinical trials involving humans publicly available. It also aims to: improve the comprehensiveness, completeness and accuracy of registered clinical trial data; communicate and raise awareness of the need to register clinical trials; ensure the accessibility of registered data; build capacity for clinical trial registration; encourage the utilization of registered data; and ensure the sustainability of the ICTRP.

Echinococcosis,https://www.who.int/health-topics/echinococcosis,"Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease that occurs in two main forms in humans: cystic echinococcosis (also known as hydatidosis) and alveolar echinococcosis, caused by the tapeworms Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis , respectively. Dogs, foxes and other carnivores harbour the adult worms in their intestine and evacuate the parasite eggs in their faeces. If the eggs are ingested by humans, they develop into larvae in several organs, mainly the liver and lungs. Both cystic and alveolar echinococcosis are characterized by asymptomatic incubation periods that can last many years until the parasite larvae evolve and trigger clinical signs. Both diseases can cause serious morbidity and death.         Cystic echinococcosis is characterized
by an asymptomatic incubation period that can last many years until the
parasite cysts evolve and trigger clinical signs, depending on the location and
size of the cysts and the pressure exerted on the surrounding tissues. In cystic
echinococcosis, the larval stages of the parasite develop as one or more cysts
mainly in the liver and lungs, and less frequently in the bones, kidneys,
spleen, muscles, central nervous system and eyes. Abdominal pain, nausea and
vomiting commonly occur when cysts invade the liver. If the lung is affected,
clinical signs include chronic cough, chest pain and shortness of breath. Alveolar echinococcosis is
characterized by an asymptomatic incubation period of 5–15 years and the slow
development of a primary tumour-like lesion which is usually located in the
liver. Lesions may also involve other organs such as the spleen, lungs and
brain following dissemination of the parasite via the blood and lymphatic
system. Clinical signs include weight loss, abdominal pain, general malaise and
signs of hepatic failure. If left untreated, alveolar echinococcosis is
progressive and fatal. Both cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis can be expensive and complicated to treat, sometimes requiring extensive surgery and/or prolonged drug therapy. The treatment used should be decided based on results from ultrasound images of the cyst. Treatments can include percutaneous treatment of the hydatid cysts with the PAIR (Puncture, Aspiration, Injection, Re-aspiration) technique, surgery, anti-infective drug treatments or simply watching and waiting. Human cystic echinococcosis is diagnosed with imaging tools such as ultrasound or computed tomography, and its laboratory confirmation relies on serological tests. Diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis is based on clinical findings and epidemiological data, imaging techniques, histopathology and/or nucleic acid detection, and serology. Early diagnosis and radical (tumour-like) surgery followed by anti-infective prophylaxis remain the key elements. If the lesion is confined, radical surgery offers cure. Unfortunately, in many patients the disease is diagnosed at an advanced stage, and palliative surgery, if carried out without or with incomplete anti-parasitic treatment, frequently results in relapses.

Health impact assessment,https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-impact-assessment,"Health impact assessment (HIA) is a practical approach used to systematically judge the potential health effects of a policy, strategy, plan, programme or project on a population, particularly on vulnerable or disadvantaged groups. HIA can help to identify the distribution of those effects within the population, generate evidence for proper action to avoid and mitigate sometimes unintended health risks, and promote health opportunities. Recommendations are produced for decision-makers and stakeholders, and a framework for monitoring and evaluating changes in health is offered as part of performance management and sustainable development. The approach can be applied in diverse economic sectors and uses quantitative, qualitative and participatory techniques. Examples of how HIA has been used include clean energy options, master plans, planning for green spaces, transportation and urban growth projects, zoning for walkability, air pollution and noise reduction interventions, climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. HIA provides a way to engage with members of the public affected by a particular proposal. It also helps decision-makers and Member States make choices about alternatives and improvements to prevent disease or injury and to actively promote health. It is based on the four interlinked values of democracy (promoting stakeholder participation), equity (considering the impact on the whole population), sustainable development and the ethical use of evidence.     HIA is a consolidated approach to estimate and anticipate the consequences
of policies, plans, programmes and projects. It is a key resource for achieving
foresight in societal decision-making, systematically deployed worldwide. Economic
sectors such as transport, agriculture, energy, waste and housing have profound
impacts on health. For instance, transport is a major factor in traffic
injuries, air pollution and noise, and healthy transport policies can help
reduce these risks, as well as promoting walking and cycling. In agriculture,
fertilizers and pesticides may boost crop yields, but wise use is important to
protect farm workers and consumers from excessive chemical exposure. Health
impact assessment can be a valuable tool for helping to develop policy and
assisting decision-makers in these and other areas.                                                         WHO is responding by building the capacity, providing tools and initiatives in health impact assessment to dynamically improve health and well-being across sectors. WHO supports the health sector to effectively engage in urban health, working across sectors to help cities to produce contextual, meaningful and actionable information on the health, economic and climate impacts of urban environments. WHO supports decision-makers to equip themselves to accept, reject or amend policy alternatives, in the knowledge that they have the best available health evidence before them. Health risk assessment techniques have been applied in the air pollution field for many years. Tools for HIA include AirQ+, with the goal to quantify the health burden and impact of air pollution; CLIMAQ-H , a software assessing the outcomes of climate-driven policies and support decision-making; and HEAT for walking and cycling , a web-based tool used to estimate the health and economic impacts of increased walking and cycling.

Hendra virus infection,https://www.who.int/health-topics/hendra-virus-infection,"Hendra virus (HeV) infection is a rare emerging zoonosis (disease that can be transmitted to humans from animals) that causes severe and often fatal disease in both infected horses and humans. The natural host of the virus has been identified as being
    fruit bats of the Pteropodidae Family, Pteropus genus. HeV was identified during the first recorded outbreak of the disease in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra, Australia, in 1994. The outbreak involved 21 stabled racehorses and two human cases. As of July 2016, 53 disease incidents involving over 70 horses have been reported. These incidents were all confined to the north-eastern coast of Australia. A total of seven humans have contracted Hendra virus
    from infected horses, particularly through close contact during care or necropsy of ill or dead horses         Symptoms of Hendra virus infection in humans range from mild influenza-like illness to fatal respiratory or neurological disease. There is no specific treatment for human cases of Hendra virus. Intensive supportive care is provided, and the use of monoclonal antibodies is being investigated. A registered Hendra animal vaccine exists and vaccination is recognised as an effective way to reduce the risk of horses becoming infected and to reduce the likelihood of human exposure.

Malnutrition,https://www.who.int/health-topics/malnutrition,"Malnutrition refers to deficiencies or excesses in nutrient intake, imbalance of essential nutrients or impaired nutrient utilization. The double burden of malnutrition consists of both undernutrition and overweight and obesity, as well as diet-related noncommunicable diseases. Undernutrition manifests in four broad forms: wasting, stunting, underweight, and micronutrient deficiencies. Wasting is defined as low weight-for-height. It often indicates recent and severe weight loss, although it can also persist for a long time. It usually occurs when a person has not had food of adequate quality and quantity and/or they have had frequent or prolonged illnesses. Wasting in children is associated with a higher risk of death if not treated properly. Stunting is defined as low height-for-age. It is the result of chronic or recurrent undernutrition, usually associated with poverty, poor maternal health and nutrition, frequent illness and/or inappropriate feeding and care in early life. Stunting prevents children from reaching their physical and cognitive potential. Underweight is defined as low weight-for-age. A child who is underweight may be stunted, wasted or both. Micronutrient deficiencies are a lack of vitamins and minerals that are essential for body functions such as producing enzymes, hormones and other substances needed for growth and development. Learn about Nutrition and Food Safety and COVID-19     In 2018, stunting affected an estimated 21.9% or 149 million children under the age of 5 years, while wasting affected 7.3% or 49 million children under the age of 5 years. Around 45% of deaths among children under the age of 5 years are linked to undernutrition. These mostly occur in low- and middle-income countries. At the same time, in these same countries, rates of childhood overweight and obesity are rising. Every country in the world is affected by one or more forms of malnutrition. Combating malnutrition in all its forms is one of the greatest global health challenges. Women, infants, children and adolescents are at the highest risk of malnutrition. Optimizing nutrition early in life – including the 1000 days from conception to a child’s second birthday – ensures the best possible start in life, with long-term benefits. Poverty amplifies the risk of, and risks from, malnutrition. People who are poor are more likely to be affected by different forms of malnutrition. Malnutrition increases health care costs, reduces productivity and slows economic growth, which can perpetuate a cycle of poverty and ill-health.        WHO works with Member States and partners towards the goal of ending all forms of malnutrition by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. Meeting this goal is contingent on securing universal access to effective nutrition interventions and to healthy diets from sustainable and resilient food systems. To this end, WHO advocates for policies that promote nutrition on a global scale and develop evidence-informed guidance for their implementation. This work is framed by the 2012 World Health Assembly resolution 65.6: Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant and young child nutrition. It also contributes to the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition 2016–2025.  Actions to end malnutrition are also vital for achieving the diet-related targets of the Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020, the Global strategy for women’s, children’s, and adolescent’s health 2016–2030, and the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development.

Physical activity,https://www.who.int/health-topics/physical-activity,"Regular physical activity is proven to help prevent and manage noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes and several cancers. It also helps to maintain a healthy body weight and can improve mental health, quality of life and well-being. Physical activity refers to all movement. Popular ways to be active include walking, cycling, wheeling, sports, active recreation and play, and can be done at any level of skill and for enjoyment by everybody. Work such as household chores or jobs requiring physical labour is another way to be physically active. Yet, current global estimates show 1 in 3 adults and 81% of adolescents do not do enough physical activity. Furthermore, as countries develop economically, levels of inactivity increase and can be as high as 70% due to changing transport patterns, increased use of technology for work and recreation, cultural values and increasing sedentary behaviour. Sedentary behaviour is periods of low energy expenditure such as sitting and watching TV. Both sedentary behaviour and inadequate levels of physical activity have negative impacts on health systems, the environment, economic development, community and individual well-being and quality of life.     Physical inactivity is one of the leading risk factors for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and death worldwide.  Alternately, regular physical activity reduces risk of many types of cancer by 8–28%; heart disease and stroke by 19%; diabetes by 17%, depression and dementia by 28–32%.  It is estimated that 4–5 million deaths per year could be averted if the global population was more active. One in 4 adults and 4 in 5 adolescents don’t do enough physical activity. Women and girls generally are less active than men and boys, widening health inequalities. Older adults and people living with disabilities are also less likely to be active and miss out on the physical, mental and social health benefits. Physical inactivity burdens society through the hidden and growing cost of medical care and loss of productivity. WHO developed an economic analysis which predicts that nearly 500 million new cases of preventable major NCDs will occur globally between 2020 and  2030 if the prevalence of physical inactivity does not change. These NCDs will cost an estimated US $300 billion in healthcare costs alone in that 11 year period, or about US$ 27 billion per year. These estimates do not include the significant indirect costs including loss of productivity. Failing to increase levels of physical activity will negatively impact attainment of global targets as well as multiple SDGs.        In response to the urgent need to address physical inactivity levels worldwide, WHO developed the Global action plan on physical activity 2018–2030 (GAPPA): more active people for a healthier world . WHO supports countries and stakeholders to implement the recommended actions by: setting global      policy and guidelines, underpinned by latest evidence and consensus, which      are developed to help countries develop appropriate policies, investment      cases and financing mechanisms to increase levels of physical activity      among all populations; providing global      tools and resources including toolkits and training packages to      promote key activities, such as walking and cycling; integrating physical      activity into primary health care; and innovations using digital platforms      to help change behaviours. Capacity building is supported with WHO      Academy courses, workshops and other knowledge exchange activities; coordinating and      collaborating across sectors including sports, transport, education and      environment sectors to provide safe places and opportunities for physical      activity for everyone and to inform the development of norms and policy that      amplify key messages; and monitoring global      progress on implementation of the Global action plan on physical      activity through the Global status report , and levels of      physical inactivity through instruments such as Global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ) and the Global school-based student health survey (GSHS) .

Tobacco,https://www.who.int/health-topics/tobacco,"Nicotine contained in tobacco is highly addictive and tobacco use is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, over 20 different types or subtypes of cancer, and many other debilitating health conditions. Every year, more than 8
million people die from tobacco use. Most tobacco-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, which are often targets of intensive tobacco industry interference and marketing. Tobacco can also be deadly for non-smokers. Second-hand smoke exposure has also been implicated in adverse health outcomes, causing 1.2 million deaths annually. Nearly half of all children breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke and 65 000 children die
each year due to illnesses related to second-hand smoke. Smoking while pregnant can lead to several life-long health conditions for babies. Heated tobacco products (HTPs) contain tobacco and expose users to toxic emissions, many of which cause cancer and are harmful to health. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS), commonly known as e-cigarettes,
do not contain tobacco and may or may not contain nicotine, but are harmful to health and undoubtedly unsafe. However, it is too early to provide a clear answer on the long-term impact of HTPs and/or e-cigarette use.     An estimated 1.3 billion people worldwide use tobacco products, 80% of whom are in low- and middle-income countries. Tobacco use contributes to poverty by diverting household spending from basic needs, such as food and shelter, to tobacco. This spending
behaviour is difficult to curb because tobacco is so addictive. It also causes premature death and disability of productive age adults in households thus leading to reduced household income and increased healthcare costs. In addition to the detrimental impact of tobacco on health, the total economic cost of smoking (from health expenditures and productivity losses together) are estimated to be around US$ 1.4 trillion per year, equivalent in magnitude to 1.8% of the world's
annual gross domestic product (GDP). Almost 40% of this cost occurred in developing countries, highlighting the substantial burden these countries suffer. Tobacco taxes are applied in part to combat this effect and are seen as the most cost-effective way of curbing tobacco use, particularly among youth and low-income populations. A tax increase that increases tobacco prices by 10% decreases tobacco consumption
by about 4% in high-income countries and about 5% in low- and middle-income countries.        The scale of this human and economic tragedy is shocking, but it’s also preventable. Big Tobacco — along with all manufacturers of tobacco products — is fighting to ensure the dangers of their products are concealed, but we are fighting back: In 2003, WHO Member States unanimously adopted the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), the only public health treaty under the auspices of WHO. In force since 2005, it has currently 181 Parties. To help countries implement the WHO FCTC, WHO introduced MPOWER, a package of technical measures and resources, each of which corresponds to at least one provision of the WHO FCTC. MPOWER builds the capacity of countries to implement 6 measures to reduce the demand for tobacco products: monitor tobacco use and prevention policies, protect people from tobacco use, offer help to quit tobacco use, warn about the dangers of tobacco, enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship and raise taxes on tobacco.

Leishmaniasis,https://www.who.int/health-topics/leishmaniasis,"The leishmaniases are a group of diseases caused by protozoan parasites from more than 20 Leishmania species. These parasites are transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected female phlebotomine sandfly, a tiny – 2–3 mm long – insect vector. There are three main forms of the disease: cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar, and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL). CL is the most common form, VL is the most severe form and MCL is the most disabling form of the disease. Most people who become infected with the parasite do not develop any symptoms during their lifetime. Therefore, the term leishmaniasis refers to the condition of becoming sick due to a Leishmania infection, not to being infected with the parasite. Today, more than 1 billion people live in areas endemic for leishmaniasis and are at risk of infection. An estimated 30 000 new cases of VL and more than 1 million new cases of CL occur annually.         CL usually produces ulcers on the exposed parts of the body, such as the face, arms and legs. There may be many lesions – sometimes up to 200 – which can cause serious disability. When the ulcers heal, they invariably leave permanent scars, which can lead to stigmatization, especially for women and girls. VL is characterized by irregular bouts of fever, substantial weight loss, swelling of the spleen and liver and serious anaemia. If the disease is not treated, the fatality rate can be as high as 100% within 2 years. MCL produces lesions that can partially or totally destroy the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat cavities and surrounding tissues. This disabling form can also lead to social exclusion. PKDL (post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis), a complication of VL, is mainly seen in East Africa and South-East Asia. It is characterized by a discoloured (hypopigmented) flat skin (macular) rash, combined with some slightly elevated (maculopapular) or elevated (nodular) rash, usually in patients who have recovered from VL. PKDL usually appears 6 months to 1 or more years after apparent cure of VL, but it may occur earlier or even concurrently with VL, especially in Sudan. PKDL heals spontaneously in most cases in Africa but rarely in patients in India. Antileishmanial treatment depends on the causative species and the condition of the patient (e.g. pregnancy, immunosuppression). Regardless of the causative Leishmania species, antileishmanial treatment cannot provide a sterile cure, and the parasite remains in the human body and can cause a relapse when there is immunosuppression. Treatment is complex and should be administered by highly experienced health personnel. Most antileishmanial medicines are injectable.                                                                    ",WHO
"Eye care, vision impairment and blindness",https://www.who.int/health-topics/blindness-and-vision-loss,"Eye conditions are remarkably common. Those who live long enough will experience at least one eye condition during their lifetime. Globally, at least 1 billion people have a near or distance vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. In the absence of timely detection, reduced or absent eyesight can have long-term personal and economic effects. Vision impairment affects people of all ages, with the majority being over the age of 50. Young children with early onset severe vision impairment can experience lower levels of educational achievement, and in adults it often affects quality of life through lower productivity, decreased workforce participation and high rates of depression. Vision impairment and blindness impact the life of people everywhere. In low- and middle-income settings the burden of vision impairment can be even greater due to fewer opportunities to access the most essential eye care services. Cataracts and uncorrected refractive errors are estimated to be the leading causes of vision impairment; however, other causes for vision impairment cannot be ignored. Age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, long standing systemic conditions like diabetes causing diabetic retinopathy, infectious diseases of the eye and trauma to the eye are all equally important causes for vision impairment that need to be addressed.          Although effective interventions exist to address the two leading causes of vision impairment, namely optical correction for refractive errors and surgery for cataract, there remains a large unmet need for care. Spectacles are the most common intervention used worldwide to compensate for refractive error, as well as contact lenses and refractive surgeries. Spectacles and cataract surgery are both highly cost-effective interventions that can substantially improve a person’s quality of life. Treatment and care for many eye conditions, such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, pterygium, amblyopia, strabismus and retinopathy of prematurity require long-term monitoring to control the progression of the condition. Treatment is also required for commonly presenting acute eye conditions that do not typically cause vision impairment but affect people’s lives with pain and discomfort (dry eye, conjunctivitis and blepharitis, etc.). To prevent further complications, the management of these eye conditions is often directed at treating the cause or alleviating the symptoms. Vision impairment that cannot be corrected or reversed requires rehabilitation measures, for which there are several available. For those who live with blindness, braille reading, counselling and home skills training, mobility training with white canes and digital assistive technologies can ensure free, independent and safe mobility.    Eye conditions that can be targeted effectively with preventive strategies include congenital and acquired eye conditions, myopia, ocular trauma, and ocular infections and inflammations.  A good example of this is the practice of preventative lifestyle changes among children, including a combination of increased time spent outdoors and decreased near-work activities. This may delay the onset and slow the progression of myopia, which reduces the risk of high myopia and its complications later in life. Importantly, the prevention and management of systemic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, can also be effective in reducing the risk of ocular diseases. In addition, interventions to prevent vitamin A deficiency, measles and rubella, through vitamin A supplementation and immunization, are highly effective in reducing the risk of corneal opacities that can occur secondary to these conditions. Another example is the prevention of workplace ocular injuries through promoting the use of protective eye equipment (e.g., masks, protective goggles, visors etc.) during high-risk activities and industries (e.g., certain sports, agricultural activities, construction workers, welders etc.).

Medicines,https://www.who.int/health-topics/medicines,"The first synthetic pharmaceutical, Aspirin, was introduced in 1897. Since then there have been incredible advances in drugs for a wide range of health concerns including disease, mental health and other conditions. Today there are thousands of drugs
    on the market able to prevent, treat and lessen the impact of ailments that would have been fatal just a few generations ago. At the same time, antimicrobial resistance is challenging the effectiveness of many commonly used medicines in one of the
    most concerning threats to global health today. Access to appropriate medications is shown to have substantial impacts on community health and the related economic indicators. Quality-assured, safe and effective medicines, vaccines and medical
devices are fundamental to a functioning health system. However, globalized trade can undermine regulation, and in resource-limited settings especially, incidence of substandard or falsified medicines is growing. Working to increase access to essential
pharmaceuticals while limiting the spread of falsified products is at the heart of WHO’s global strategy on medicines.     Equal access and the reliable supply of medicines is an
ongoing goal of WHO and global health delivery systems, the achievement of
which is hampered by several factors. The first is regulatory issues, which can
affect how medicines are bought to market, create lag times and cause the
supply of medicines in some areas of the globe to be delayed long after they
are available elsewhere. High prices, misuse of drugs and poor or unreliable
drug quality contribute to this issue. Price has long been a barrier in poor
countries, but because of sharp increases in recent years, this issue is
spreading to some wealthy countries as well. The price of medicine remains the largest impediment to
access and the economic impact of pharmaceuticals is substantial. They are the
largest public expenditure on health after personal costs in many low-income
countries, and the expense is a major cause of household impoverishment and
debt. Public expenditure ranges widely between nations, from under 20% of total
healthcare costs in high-income countries to up to 66% in low-income countries.        Universal health coverage can only be achieved when there
is affordable access to safe, effective and quality medicines and health
products. WHO works with partners and Member States to strengthen regulation,
including post-marketing surveillance, and to eliminate substandard and
falsified medicines. It also develops international norms and standards so that
countries worldwide can regulate health products and technologies consistently.
In parallel, WHO facilitates access to quality-assured, safe and effective health
products by assessing medicines, vaccines and medical devices for priority
diseases, while working to fight the growing issue of antibacterial resistance. Since 1977, WHO has maintained a list of essential
medicines as a means to promote health equity around the world. This list began
with 208 identified medicines and has grown to include 460 different

Tsunamis,https://www.who.int/health-topics/tsunamis,"Tsunamis are giant waves that are produced when a large volume of water is displaced in an ocean or large lake by an earthquake, volcanic eruption, underwater landslide or meteorite. Between 1998-2017, tsunamis caused more than 250 000 deaths globally, including more than 227 000 deaths due to the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004. Tsunamis can travel thousands of kilometres with speeds up to 800 kilometres per hour. Once they reach the coast, they can have devastating impacts on the community. Successive crests can arrive at intervals of every 10 to 45 minutes and wreak destruction for several hours. More than 700 million people live in low-lying coastal areas and Small Island Developing States exposed to extreme sea-level events including tsunamis. Resilient infrastructure, early warning systems, and education is critical to saving people and protecting their assets against tsunami risk in the future.     Drowning is the most significant cause of death due to tsunamis. Injuries from debris account for many of the health care needs in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Falling structures and waters full of swirling debris can inflict crush injuries, fractures, and a variety of open and closed wounds. The risk of communicable diseases depends on the size, health status and living conditions of the population displaced by the tsunami. The population could be at risk of water-borne diseases and respiratory diseases due to crowding in temporary shelters and inadequate water and sanitation, as well as vaccine-preventable diseases if there is a low vaccination coverage rate prior to the disaster. Survivors of tsunamis often also face short- and long-term mental health effects due to loss of family, property, livestock or crops. The immediate health concerns after the rescue of survivors following a natural disaster are drinking water, food, shelter and medical care for injuries. The magnitude of the physical and human costs from tsunamis can be reduced if adequate emergency prevention, preparedness, response and recovery measures are implemented in a sustainable and timely manner. WHO works with Member States to build resilient and proactive health systems that can anticipate the needs and challenges during emergencies so that they are more likely to reduce risks and respond effectively when needed. As the health cluster lead for global emergencies, WHO works with partners to respond to: ensure appropriate food supplementation; restore primary care services, like immunization, child and maternal health, and mental health; assemble mobile health teams and outreach; conduct epidemic surveillance, early warning and response; call for emergency funding to support health action.

Epilepsy,https://www.who.int/health-topics/epilepsy,"Epilepsy is the most
common chronic brain disease and affects people of all ages. More than 50
million people worldwide have epilepsy; nearly 80% of them live in low- and
middle-income countries. An estimated 70% of people
with epilepsy could be seizure free if properly diagnosed and treated. However,
about three quarters of people with epilepsy in low-income countries do not get
the treatment they need, and this rises to 90% in some countries. In many such
countries, many health professionals do not have the training to recognize,
diagnose and treat epilepsy. In most resource-poor countries, antiseizure medicines
are not available. People with epilepsy and
their families frequently suffer from stigma and discrimination. In many parts
of the world the true nature of epilepsy has also long been distorted by myths,
fear and mistaken notions about the disorder. WHO is working with
ministries of health and partners to improve access to treatment for epilepsy.             Previous WHO collaborative
programmes on epilepsy have shown that integrating epilepsy care in primary
health care can significantly reduce the epilepsy treatment gap. Based on the
evidence-based methods of the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP),
WHO supports the training of primary care, non-specialist health care providers
to diagnose, treat and follow up people with epilepsy. The WHO Programme on
Reducing the Epilepsy Treatment Gap combined several innovative strategies to
support access and care to services for people with epilepsy, thereby reducing
the epilepsy treatment gap. The Programme was implemented in four countries –
Ghana, Mozambique, Myanmar and Viet Nam. WHO published Improving the
lives of people with epilepsy: a technical brief , which sets out the actions required to deliver an integrated
approach to epilepsy care and treatment. This better meets the multifaceted
needs of people with epilepsy.      Epilepsy is not contagious and is characterized by seizures, which occur because of temporary excessive electric activity in the brain. During seizures, people may lose consciousness or awareness, control of bowel or bladder function, they may not be able to hear or see properly, and their movements may become disturbed. The loss of movement control and sensation can cause injuries from falls. A diagnosis of epilepsy is made by a health professional if there is medical history of at least two seizures. Often this is further confirmed by electroencephalography (EEG), a painless technological method to record and study the electrical activity of the brain. Treatment for epilepsy can be very effective. With antiseizure medicines, up to 70% of people living with epilepsy could become seizure free. After 2 years of taking medicines without any seizures, a health professional may advise stopping the medicines. Where medicines are not helpful in relieving the condition, some types of surgery can be beneficial. Since people with epilepsy have higher occurrence of psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression, psychosocial help is also useful.

Sexual health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/sexual-health,"Sexual health is fundamental to the overall health and well-being of individuals, couples and families, and to the social and economic development of communities and countries. Sexual health, when viewed affirmatively, requires a positive and respectful
    approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. The ability of men and women to achieve sexual health and well-being depends
    on their: access to comprehensive, good-quality information about sex and sexuality; knowledge about the risks they may face and their vulnerability to adverse consequences of unprotected sexual activity; ability to access sexual health care; living in an environment that affirms and promotes sexual health. Sexual health-related issues are wide-ranging, and encompass sexual orientation and gender identity, sexual expression, relationships, and pleasure. They also include negative consequences or conditions such as: infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and reproductive tract infections (RTIs) and their adverse outcomes (such as cancer and infertility); unintended pregnancy and abortion; sexual dysfunction; sexual violence; and harmful practices (such as female genital mutilation, FGM).                                                               WHO has been working in the area of sexual health since at least 1974, when the deliberations of an expert committee resulted in the publication of a technical report entitled “Education and treatment in human sexuality” (WHO, 1975). Starting
in 2000, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and WHO convened a number of expert consultations to review terminology and identify programme options. The culmination of these meetings was a Technical Consultation in 2002,  where the working
definitions of the key sexual health-related terms below were developed. Sex Sex refers to the biological characteristics that define humans as female or male. While these sets of biological characteristics are not mutually exclusive, as there are individuals who possess both, they tend to differentiate humans as males
                and females. In general use in many languages, the term sex is often used to mean “sexual activity”, but for technical purposes in the context of sexuality and sexual health discussions, the above definition is preferred. Show less Show more Sexual health According to the current working definition, sexual health is: “…a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality
                and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must
                be respected, protected and fulfilled.” (WHO, 2006a) Show less Show more Sexuality Sexual health cannot be defined, understood or made operational without a broad consideration of sexuality, which underlies important behaviours and outcomes related to sexual health. The working definition of sexuality is: “…a central aspect of being human throughout life encompasses sex, gender identities and roles, sexual orientation, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy and reproduction. Sexuality is experienced and expressed in thoughts, fantasies,
                desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviours, practices, roles and relationships. While sexuality can include all of these dimensions, not all of them are always experienced or expressed. Sexuality is influenced by the interaction of
                biological, psychological, social, economic, political, cultural, legal, historical, religious and spiritual factors.” (WHO, 2006a) Show less Show more Sexual rights There is a growing consensus that sexual health cannot be achieved and maintained without respect for, and protection of, certain human rights. The working definition of sexual rights given below is a contribution to the continuing dialogue
                on human rights related to sexual health.The application of existing human rights to sexuality and sexual health constitute sexual rights. Sexual rights protect all people's rights to fulfil and express their sexuality and enjoy sexual
                health, with due regard for the rights of others and within a framework of protection against discrimination."" (WHO, 2006a, updated 2010) “The fulfilment of sexual health is tied to the extent to which human rights are respected, protected and fulfilled. Sexual rights embrace certain human rights that are already recognized in international and regional human rights documents
                and other consensus documents and in national laws. Rights critical to the realization of sexual health include: Rights critical to the realization of sexual health include: the rights to equality and non-discrimination the right to be free from torture or to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment the right to privacy the rights to the highest attainable standard of health (including sexual health) and social security the right to marry and to found a family and enter into marriage with the free and full consent of the intending spouses, and to equality in and at the dissolution of marriage the right to decide the number and spacing of one's children the rights to information, as well as education the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to an effective remedy for violations of fundamental rights. The responsible exercise of human rights requires that all persons respect the rights of others. Show less Show more “Human rights provide an international legal framework within which the sexual and reproductive health needs and aspirations of all people can be considered.” (GRUSKIN, 2005) In recent years, international human rights instruments have been increasingly used to support and advance legal claims by individuals and whole communities so that national governments will guarantee the respect, protection and fulfilment of their sexual and reproductive health rights (Cook et al., 2003). The working definitions and framework for programming presented here are grounded in internationally recognized human rights and offer a rights-based approach to programming in sexual health. The key conceptual elements of sexual health are listed below. Key conceptual elements of sexual health When viewed holistically and positively: Sexual health is about well-being, not merely the absence of disease. Sexual health involves respect, safety and freedom from discrimination and violence. Sexual health depends on the fulfilment of certain human rights. Sexual health is relevant throughout the individual’s lifespan, not only to those in the reproductive years, but also to both the young and the elderly. Sexual health is expressed through diverse sexualities and forms of sexual expression. Sexual health is critically influenced by gender norms, roles, expectations and power dynamics. Sexual health needs to be understood within specific social, economic and political contexts.              ",WHO
Children's environmental health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/children-environmental-health,"Reducing environmental risks could prevent 1 in 4 child deaths. In 2012, 1.7 million deaths in children under five were attributable to the environment. These included 570 000 deaths from respiratory infections, 361 000 deaths from diarrhoea, 270 000 deaths from neonatal conditions, 200 000 deaths from malaria and 200 000 deaths from unintentional injuries. Environmental risks have an impact on the health and development of children, from conception through childhood and adolescence and also into adulthood. The environment determines a child’s future: early life exposures impact on adult health as fetal programming and early growth may be altered by environmental risk factors. Adverse environmental conditions and pollution are a major contributor to childhood deaths, illnesses and disability, particularly in developing countries. Children are particularly vulnerable to certain environmental risks, including: air pollution; inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene; hazardous chemicals and waste, radiation; climate change; as well as emerging threats like e-waste.                                                                 Children are more vulnerable than adults to environmental risks : Children are constantly      growing. They breathe more air, consume more food, and drink more water      than adults do, in proportion to their weight. Children's systems are still      developing. This includes their central nervous, immune, reproductive, and      digestive systems. At certain early stages of development, exposure to      environmental toxicants can lead to irreversible damage. Children behave differently      from adults and this means there are different ways they can be exposed to      environmental risks. For example, young children crawl on the ground where      they may be exposed to dust and chemicals that accumulate on floors and      soils. Children have little control      over their environment. Unlike adults, they may be both unaware of risks      and unable to make choices to protect their health. Environmental risks account for 25% of the disease burden in children under five. Children's health problems often result from exposure to a number of environmental risk factors in the places where they live, work, play and learn. Only through adopting a holistic approach to environmental risk factors can significant progress be made in reducing the environmental burden of disease on a global scale.  Such an approach means involvement across sectors and at all levels of society including individuals, communities, municipalities, healthcare professionals, and policy makers. Main environmental risks are: Climate change Air pollution Chemical safety Water sanitation and hygiene Radiation Childhood diseases related to environmental factors represent an enormous global public health problem. This is particularly true in developing countries and impoverished communities, where there is often lack of awareness and knowledge about the effects of environmental hazards on children’s health. To help address this problem, WHO prepares information and training materials and implements training activities . To allow healthcare providers to better identify and prevent childhood diseases related to environmental risk factors, experts from both developed and developing countries have been involved in the preparation and peer-review of materials on specific environmental topics.

Anaemia,https://www.who.int/health-topics/anaemia,"Anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or the haemoglobin concentration within them is lower than normal. Haemoglobin is needed to carry oxygen and if you have too few or abnormal red blood cells, or not enough haemoglobin, there will be a decreased capacity of the blood to carry oxygen to the body’s tissues. This results in symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, dizziness and shortness of breath, among others. The optimal haemoglobin concentration required to meet physiologic needs varies by age, sex, elevation of residence, smoking habits and pregnancy status.  Anaemia may be caused by several factors: nutrient deficiencies through inadequate diets or inadequate absorption of nutrients, infections (e.g. malaria, parasitic infections, tuberculosis, HIV), inflammation, chronic diseases, gynaecological and obstetric conditions, and inherited red blood cell disorders. The most common nutritional cause of anaemia is iron deficiency, although deficiencies in folate, vitamins B12 and A are also important causes. Anaemia is a serious global public health problem that particularly affects young children, menstruating adolescent girls and women, and pregnant and postpartum women. WHO estimates that 40% of children 6–59 months of age, 37% of pregnant women, and 30% of women 15–49 years of age worldwide are anaemic.         Anaemia can cause a range of non-specific symptoms including tiredness, weakness, dizziness or light-headedness, drowsiness, and shortness of breath, especially upon exertion. Children and pregnant women are especially vulnerable, with more severe cases of anaemia leading to an increased risk of maternal and child mortality. Iron deficiency anaemia has also been shown to affect cognitive and physical development in children and reduce productivity in adults. Anaemia is an indicator of both poor nutrition and poor health. It is problematic on its own, but it can also impact other global public health concerns such as stunting and wasting, low birth weight and childhood overweight and obesity due to lack of energy to exercise. School performance in children and reduced work productivity in adults due to anaemia can have further social and economic impacts for the individual and family.    Accurate characterization of anaemia is critical to understand the burden and epidemiology of this problem, for planning public health interventions, and for clinical care of people across the life course. While iron deficiency anaemia is the most common form and can often be treated through dietary changes, other forms of anaemia must be treated by addressing underlying infections and chronic conditions requiring comprehensive health interventions. WHO has guidance that covers all WHO Regions to help reduce the prevalence of anaemia through prevention and treatment. These guidelines aim to increase dietary diversity, improve infant feeding practices and improve the bioavailability and intake of micronutrients through fortification or supplementation with iron, folic acid and other vitamins and mineral. Social and behaviour change communication strategies are used to change nutrition-related behaviours. Interventions to address the underlying and basic causes of anaemia look at issues such as disease control, water, sanitation and hygiene, reproductive health and root causes such as poverty, lack of education and gender norms. Anaemia, as a public health issue, needs to be addressed from multiple perspectives and through multiple coordinated efforts, including multiple government sectors, nongovernmental organizations, United Nations agencies and the private sector – each with specific and complementary roles to collectively achieve anaemia reduction and improve health and well-being.

inflammatory disease usually of the foot but any part of the body can be
 affected. Infection is most probably acquired by traumatic inoculation 
of certain fungi or ‎bacteria into the subcutaneous tissue. Mycetoma was
 described in the modern literature in 1694 but was first reported in 
the mid-19th century in the Indian town of Madura, and hence was 
initially called Madura foot. Mycetoma commonly affects young adults, particularly males 
aged between 20 and 40 years, mostly in  developing countries. People of
 low socioeconomic status and manual workers such as agriculturalists, 
labourers and herdsmen are the worst affected. Mycetoma has numerous adverse medical, health and socioeconomic impacts on patients, communities and health authorities. As mycetoma is a badly neglected disease, accurate data on its incidence and prevalence are not available.         Mycetoma is characterized by a triad of painless 
‎subcutaneous mass, multiple sinuses and discharge ‎containing grains. 
It usually ‎spreads to involve the skin, deep structures and bone 
resulting in ‎destruction, ‎deformity and loss of function, which may be fatal. ‎Mycetoma commonly ‎involves the extremities, back and 
gluteal region.‎ Given its slow progression, painless nature, massive lack of 
health education and scarcity of medical and health facilities in 
endemic areas, many patients present late with advanced infection where 
amputation may be the only available treatment.  Secondary bacterial 
infection is common, and lesions may cause increased pain and disability
 and fatal septicaemia (severe infections involving the entire human 
system) if untreated. Infection is not transmitted from human to human. The treatment depends on the causative organisms for the 
bacterial causes; it is a long term antibiotics combination whereas for
 the fungal type,  treatment requires combined antifungals drugs and 
surgery. The treatment is unsatisfactory, has many side effects, is 
expensive and not available in most endemic areas. Mycetoma is not a notifiable disease (a disease required by 
law to be reported) and no surveillance systems exist.  There no

Violence against children,https://www.who.int/health-topics/violence-against-children,"Violence against children includes all forms of violence against people under 18 years old. For infants and younger children, violence mainly involves child maltreatment (i.e. physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect) at the hands of parents and other authority figures. Boys and girls are at equal risk of physical and emotional abuse and neglect, and girls are at greater risk of sexual abuse. As children reach adolescence, peer violence and intimate partner violence, in addition to child maltreatment, become highly prevalent. Violence against children can be prevented. Preventing and responding to violence against children requires that efforts systematically address risk and protective factors at all four interrelated levels of risk (individual, relationship, community, society). A May 2016 World Health Assembly resolution endorsed the first ever WHO Global plan of action on strengthening the role of the health system within a national multisectoral response to address interpersonal violence, in particular against women and girls, and against children. According to this plan, WHO in collaboration with Member States and other partners, is committed to: Monitoring the global magnitude and characteristics of violence against children and supporting country efforts to document and measure such violence. Maintaining an electronic information system that summarizes the scientific data on the burden, risk factors and consequences of violence against children, and the evidence for its preventability. Developing and disseminating evidence-based technical guidance documents, norms and standards for preventing and responding to violence against children. Regularly publishing global status reports on country efforts to address violence against children through national policies and action plans, laws, prevention programmes and response services. Supporting countries and partners in implementing evidence-based prevention and response strategies, such as those included in INSPIRE: Seven strategies for ending violence against children . Collaborating with international agencies and organizations to reduce and eliminate violence against children globally, through initiatives such as the Global Partnership to End Violence against Children, Together for Girls and the Violence Prevention Alliance.                                                                     Child maltreatment is the abuse and neglect that occurs to children under 18 years of age. It includes all types of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, negligence and commercial or other exploitation, which results in actual or potential harm to the child’s health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust or power. Exposure to intimate partner violence is also sometimes included as a form of child maltreatment. Child maltreatment has enormous immediate and long-term repercussions. Beyond death, physical injury and disability, violence can lead to stress that impairs brain development and damages the nervous and immune systems. This in turn is associated with delayed cognitive development, poor school performance and dropout, mental health problems, suicide attempts, increased health-risk behaviours, revictimization and the perpetration of violence. The good news is that child maltreatment can be prevented through interventions that support parents and caregivers, promote non-violent norms and values, provide education and life skills training, strengthen families’ income and economic security, offer high quality response and support services, create and sustain safe environments for children, and implement and enforce laws against child maltreatment. WHO, in collaboration with a number of partners: provides technical and normative guidance for evidence-based child maltreatment prevention; advocates for increased international support for and investment in evidence-based child maltreatment prevention; provides technical support for evidence-based child maltreatment prevention programmes in several low- and middle-income countries. Youth violence is a global public health problem. It includes a range of acts from bullying and physical fighting, to more severe sexual and physical assault to homicide. Youth violence dramatically increases health, welfare and criminal justice costs; reduces productivity;  and generally undermines the fabric of society. Beyond deaths, injuries and psychological harm, youth violence can lead to increased health risk behaviours such as smoking, substance abuse , unsafe sex, and further violence. These in turn are associated with chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, early pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Effective prevention and response strategies include those that promote parenting and early childhood development; school-based bullying prevention, academic, and life and social skills development programmes; therapeutic approaches with high-risk individuals, and community- and society-level approaches like reducing access to and misuse of alcohol and firearms, hotspots and problem-oriented policing, urban upgrading, and poverty de-concentration. WHO and partners decrease youth violence through initiatives that help to identify, quantify and respond to the problem, these include: developing a package for schools-based violence prevention programmes; drawing attention to the magnitude of youth violence and the need for prevention; building evidence on the scope and types of violence in different settings; developing guidance for Member States and all relevant sectors to prevent youth violence and strengthen responses to it; supporting national efforts to prevent youth violence; and collaborating with international agencies and organizations to prevent youth violence globally.

Complementary feeding,https://www.who.int/health-topics/complementary-feeding,"Around the age of 6 months, an infant’s need for energy and nutrients starts to exceed what is provided by breast milk, and complementary foods are necessary to meet those needs. An infant of this age is also developmentally ready for other foods.
This transition is referred to as complementary feeding. If complementary foods are not introduced around the age of 6 months, or if they are given inappropriately, an infant’s growth may falter. Ensuring that infants nutritional needs are met requires that complementary foods be: timely – meaning that they are introduced when the need for energy and nutrients exceeds what can be provided through exclusive breastfeeding; adequate – meaning that they provide sufficient energy, protein and micronutrients to meet a growing child’s nutritional needs; safe – meaning that they are hygienically stored and prepared, and fed with clean hands using clean utensils and not bottles and teats; properly fed – meaning that they are given consistent with a child’s signals of appetite and satiety, and that meal frequency and feeding are suitable for age. Caregivers should take active care in the feeding of infants by being responsive to the child’s clues for hunger and also encouraging the child to eat.             WHO is committed to support countries with implementation and monitoring of the "" Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant and young child nutrition ”, which includes 6 targets, including reducing the number of children under-5 who are stunted by 40% by 2025. The "" Global strategy for infant and young child feeding "", also aims to protect, promote and support appropriate infant and young child feeding. Appropriate complementary feeding depends on accurate information and skilled support from the family, community and health care system. WHO works with Member States to ensure key populations have adequate knowledge about appropriate foods and feeding practices in order to prevent malnutrition. WHO developed the guide "" Complementary feeding: family foods for breastfed children "", which gives more detailed guidance for health workers on how to support complementary feeding. The guidelines are also included as part of WHO’s Infant and young child feeding counselling course and the Complementary feeding counselling course for health workers.                                                          WHO recommends that infants start receiving complementary foods at 6 months of age in addition to breast milk. Initially, they should receive complementary foods 2–3 times a day between 6–8 months and increase to 3–4 times daily between 9–11 months and 12–24 months. Additional nutritious snacks should also be offered 1–2 times per day for ages 12–24 months, as desired. Gradually increase food consistency and variety as the infant gets older, adapting to the infant’s requirements and abilities. Infants can eat pureed, mashed and semi-solid foods beginning at 6 months. By 8 months most infants can also eat “finger foods” (snacks that can be eaten by children alone). By 12 months, most children can eat the same types of foods as consumed by the rest of the family, while keeping in mind the need for nutrient-dense foods, including animal-sourced foods like meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy products. Avoid foods in a form that may cause choking, such as whole grapes or raw carrots. Avoid giving drinks with low nutrient value, such as tea, coffee and sugary soft drinks. Limit the amount of juice offered, to avoid displacing more nutrient-rich foods.       ",WHO
Ultraviolet radiation,https://www.who.int/health-topics/ultraviolet-radiation,"Ultraviolet (UV) radiation covers the wavelength range of 100–400 nm, which is a higher frequency and lower wavelength than visible light. UV radiation comes naturally from the sun, but it can also be created by artificial sources used in industry, commerce and recreation. The UV region covers the wavelength range 100-400 nm and is divided into three bands: UVA (315-400 nm) UVB (280-315 nm) UVC (100-280 nm). As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, all UVC and approximately 90% of UVB radiation is absorbed by ozone, water vapour, oxygen and carbon dioxide. UVA radiation is less affected by the atmosphere. Therefore, the UV radiation reaching the Earth’s surface is largely composed of UVA with a small UVB component. The amount of UV radiation from the sun that hits the Earth’s surface depends on several factors, including the sun’s height in the sky, latitude, cloud cover, altitude, the thickness of the ozone layer and ground reflection. Reductions in the ozone layer due to human-created pollution increase the amount of UVA and UVB that reaches the surface. This can impact human health, animals, marine organisms and plant life. In humans, increased UV exposure can cause skin cancers, cataracts and immune system damage.      WHO works with Member States and partners to increase public understanding of the effects of overexposure to ultraviolet radiation. The INTERSUN Programme is a collaboration between WHO, the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Meteorological Organization, the International Agency on Cancer Research and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. It promotes and evaluates research on the health effects of UV radiation, and develops an appropriate response through guidelines, recommendations and information dissemination. The goals of the programme including providing practical and sound advice on the health and environmental impacts of UV exposure, to encourage countries to take action to reduce UV-induced health risks and to provide guidance to national authorities about sun awareness programmes. To this end, the programme collaborates with experts and specialist agencies to implement key research activities, identifies and quantifies health risks from UV radiation, develops reliable predictions of health and environmental consequences of changes in UV exposure with stratospheric ozone depletion, and develops practical ways of monitoring change in UV-induced health effects over time. The programme provides tools and guidelines related to the UV index, sun protection for children, artificial sunbeds, tourism and occupational health.        The rise in the number of cases of skin cancer over the past decades is strongly related to increased exposure to the sun during outdoor activities and to artificial sources of UV radiation such as sunlamps and tanning beds. Overexposure is also the underlying cause of harmful effects on the eyes and immune system. Adopting a few simple precautions can greatly reduce the risk of these health conditions: Limit time in the midday sun from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., particularly on days when the UV index is high. When UV rays are most intense and you must be outside, try to find shade and wear protective clothing, including a brimmed hat that provides sun protection for your head, face and neck. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen of at least 15 SPF – ideally higher– and reapply every 2 hours. Avoid sunlamps and tanning parlours, as they are known to damage the skin and eyes. Children’s UV exposure should be carefully limited because they are in a dynamic state of growth and therefore more susceptible to environmental threats than adults. Many vital functions such as the immune system are not fully developed at birth, and unsafe environments may interfere with their normal development.

Chemical safety,https://www.who.int/health-topics/chemical-safety,"Chemical Safety is achieved by undertaking all activities involving chemicals in such a way as to ensure the safety of human health and the environment. It covers all chemicals, natural and manufactured, and the full range of exposure situations from
    the natural presence of chemicals in the environment to their extraction or synthesis, industrial production, transport use and disposal. Chemical safety has many scientific and technical components. Among these are toxicology, ecotoxicology and the process of chemical risk assessment which requires a detailed knowledge of exposure and of biological effects. Through the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS), WHO works to establish the scientific basis for the sound management of chemicals, and to strengthen national capabilities and capacities for chemical safety.                                                                        Chemicals are part of our daily life. All living and inanimate matter is made up of chemicals and virtually every manufactured product involves the use of chemicals. Many chemicals can, when properly used, significantly contribute to the improvement of
    our quality of life, health and well-being. But other chemicals are highly hazardous and can negatively affect our health and environment when improperly managed. The production and use of chemicals continues to grow worldwide, particularly in developing countries. This is likely to result in greater negative effect on health if sound chemicals management is not ensured. Multisectoral action is urgently needed
    to protect human health from the harmful effects of improperly managed chemicals. WHO summarized scientific evidence and provides risk management recommendations for the 10 chemicals or groups of chemicals of major public health concern . The Seventieth World Health Assembly approved the Road map to enhance health sector engagement in the strategic approach to international chemicals management towards the 2020 goal and beyond. The WHO Secretariat has developed a workbook that offers a structured way to assist Member States to work through the
    road map, choose priorities and plan activities. One of the actions in the Chemicals road map mandates the Secretariat to establish a global chemicals and health network, with links to existing subregional, regional and international networks,
    to facilitate health sector implementation of the road map.

Hospitals,https://www.who.int/health-topics/hospitals,"Hospitals complement and amplify the effectiveness of many other parts of the health system, providing continuous availability of services for acute and complex conditions. They concentrate scarce resources within well-planned referral networks to respond efficiently to population health needs. They are an essential element of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and will be critical to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Hospitals are also an essential part of health system development. Currently, external pressures, health systems shortcomings and hospital sector deficiencies are driving a new vision for hospitals in many parts of the world. In this vision, they have a key role to play to support other healthcare providers and for community outreach and home-based services and are essential in a well-functioning referral network. Hospitals matter to people and often mark central points in their lives. They also matter to health systems by being instrumental for care coordination and integration. They often provide a setting for education of doctors, nurses and other health-care professionals and are a critical base for clinical research.     Hospitals should reflect the needs and values of the communities in and around them, while also being resilient and able to maintain and scale up services in emergency situations. Effective hospitals are designed for their users, with attention to the needs of special populations, such as children and the elderly. A well-designed hospital environment maximizes the effectiveness of clinical care delivery and enhances the well-being of patients and hospital staff. Adequate and reliable infrastructure, technologies and supplies form the backbone of the hospital. Key infrastructure (such as well-planned spaces, water and energy, telecommunications) must support daily functioning, and be designed with redundancy to ensure continued safe and effective operation, even during a disaster or crisis. Appropriate and good quality medical and ICT technologies and supplies should be available for specialized health workforce to meet the population needs. Hospital functions and organization vary according to health-care delivery organizations and each hospital’s unique position in the system. Good management structures ensure coordination among staff, services, infrastructure and supply chains to deliver high-quality care. Clinical registries and structured data audits facilitate rapid identification of high-yield areas for improvement. Regular monitoring of service quality with targeted intervention to address gaps drives ongoing improvement.                                                         Hospitals are reservoirs of critical resources and knowledge. They can be classified according to the interventions they provide, the roles they play in the health system and the health and educational services they offer to the communities in and around them. They are often the focal point for health care in a community and lead by example for sustainable development, the strengthening of health systems and in building healthy communities. Effective hospitals seek new ways to support care outside their walls to ensure people can be cared for closer to their home, within their community and at a sustainable cost. Decision-makers at the national and sub-national level create conditions to drive, enable and sustain the paradigm shift in what hospitals do and how they perform. As system architects, they need to maintain oversight of all ongoing health and health system reforms and ensure policies and incentives are coherent and aligned. Major structural reforms outside the health sector, such as decentralization, civil service, privatization and trade, greatly impact the hospital sector and need to be taken into consideration at the macro level when assessing possibilities for hospital sector transformations.

Tropical Cyclones,https://www.who.int/health-topics/tropical-cyclones,"Tropical cyclones, also known as typhoons or hurricanes, are among the most destructive weather phenomena. They are intense circular storms that originate over warm tropical oceans, and have maximum sustained wind speeds exceeding 119 kilometres per hour and heavy rains. However, the greatest damage to life and property is not from the wind, but from secondary events such as storm surges, flooding, landslides and tornadoes. Tropical cyclones are referred to by different names depending on where they originate in the world. Hurricanes occur in the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern north Pacific Ocean. Typhoons occur in the western Pacific Ocean. Tropical cyclones occur in the south Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean. From 1998-2017, storms, including tropical cyclones and hurricanes, were second only to earthquakes in terms of fatalities, killing 233 000 people. During this time, storms also affected an estimated 726 million people worldwide, meaning they were injured, made homeless, displaced or evacuated during the emergency phase of the disaster. Over the past 30 years the proportion of the world’s population living on cyclone-exposed coastlines has increased 192 percent, thus raising the risk of mortality and morbidity in the event of a tropical cyclone.     The health impacts of tropical cyclones depend on the number of people living in low-lying coastal areas in the storm’s direct path, the built environment including building design, and whether there is sufficient time for warning and evacuation. Tropical cyclones, may directly and indirectly affect health in many ways, for example by: increasing cases of drowning and other physical trauma; increasing risks of water- and vector-borne infectious diseases; increasing mental health effects associated with emergency situations; disrupting health systems, facilities and services, leaving communities without access to health care when they are needed most; damaging basic infrastructure, such as food and water supplies and safe shelter. When tropical cyclones cause floods and sea surges, the risk of drowning and water- or vector-borne diseases increase. Additionally, flood waters may contain sewage and chemicals, hide sharp objects made of metal or glass and electrical lines, or host dangerous snakes or reptiles, which can cause diseases, injuries, electrocution and bites. WHO works with Member States to build resilient and proactive health systems that can anticipate the needs and challenges during emergencies so that they are more likely to reduce risks and respond effectively when needed. During disasters, such as tropical cyclones, WHO helps to restore primary care services so that facilities can deliver essential services, including immunization, basic treatment for common illnesses, acute malnutrition and maternal care while ensuring the ongoing supply of medications for people living with HIV, tuberculosis or diabetes. As the health cluster lead for global emergencies, WHO also works with partners to respond to: ensure appropriate food supplementation; assemble mobile health teams and outreach; conduct epidemic surveillance, early warning and response; call for emergency funding to support health action.

Oxygen,https://www.who.int/health-topics/oxygen,"Oxygen is a life-saving essential medicine with no substitution. Healthcare professionals use oxygen to treat respiratory illnesses like COVID-19 and pneumonia . Oxygen is also essential for surgery and trauma. Vulnerable groups like older people , pregnant women , young infants and newborns need oxygen therapy regularly. Despite being an essential medicine, oxygen is a complex product. Medicinal oxygen is produced in an industrial process applying good manufacturing practices (GMP) or is generated on-site using oxygen concentrators, which are in many legislations regulated as medical devices. Oxygen also requires a whole system to safely reach patients. Due to their complexity, access to medical oxygen meets many challenges on availability, quality, affordability, management, supply, human resources capacity and safety. In face of these challenges, WHO continuously develops resources and tools to overcome them.     Surveys in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have found that fewer
    than half of all health facilities have uninterrupted access to oxygen. It has
    been reported that the lack of access to reliable oxygen supplies contributes
    to preventable deaths, particularly in LMICs. For example, it has been
    estimated that up to 122 000 deaths from childhood pneumonia could be prevented
    annually with the strengthening of oxygen supplies. Numerous studies show that
    oxygen access is a global problem. For example, a recent study found that among
    facilities treating respiratory infections in sub-Saharan Africa, only 1 in 5
    had oxygen in Mauritania and 1 in 10 in Niger. Surveys by the United States
    Agency for International Development found similar situations for countries in
    South America and South Asia. A serious concern at any time, the global medical
    oxygen problem has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite being an essential medicine, producing oxygen that is safe for
    patient use is a complex process since it requires the devices and systems
    needed to deliver oxygen to patients, ranging from pulse oximeters to
    ventilators, and health workers that are trained to use such devices
    effectively. However daunting, the investment of time and resources required to
    meet oxygen supply demand is worth it. The support for the urgent scale-up of
    medicinal oxygen will save lives by improving care for people with COVID-19,
    severe pneumonia and other conditions needing oxygen therapy. The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator , launched in 2020, supported assessment of oxygen needs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and supported funding to increase access to medical oxygen. This was followed in 2023 by the World Health Assembly resolution on Increasing access to medical oxygen , which urges Member States to enhance access with WHO support. WHO supports Member States to improve access to medical oxygen by: deployment of oxygen systems through direct logistical and technical support; providing technical guidance to clinical and biomedical engineering professionals (such as technical specifications , and foundations of medical oxygen systems ); education and training in the appropriate selection, procurement, maintenance, and use of medical devices ; supporting research to ensure oxygen is most effectively used for patient benefit ; and development of tools which enable forecasting and decisions related to existing and future oxygen systems.

Diabetes,https://www.who.int/health-topics/diabetes,"Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough insulin. In the past 3 decades the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels. Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself. For people living with diabetes, access to affordable treatment, including insulin, is critical to their survival. There is a globally agreed target to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity by 2025. About 830 million people worldwide have diabetes, the majority living in low-and middle-income countries. More than half of people living with diabetes are not receiving treatment. Both the number of people with diabetes and the number of people with untreated diabetes have been steadily increasing over the past decades.                                                                          Symptoms of type 1 diabetes include the need to urinate often, thirst, constant hunger, weight loss, vision changes and fatigue. These symptoms may occur suddenly. Symptoms for type 2 diabetes are generally similar to those of type 1 diabetes but are often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisen. For this reason, it is important to be aware of risk factors. Type 1 diabetes cannot currently be prevented. Effective approaches are available to prevent type 2 diabetes and to prevent the complications and premature death that can result from all types of diabetes. These include policies and practices across whole populations and within specific settings (school, home, workplace) that contribute to good health for everyone, regardless of whether they have diabetes, such as exercising regularly, eating healthily, avoiding smoking, and controlling blood pressure and lipids. The starting point for living well with diabetes is an early diagnosis – the longer a person lives with undiagnosed and untreated diabetes, the worse their health outcomes are likely to be. Easy access to basic diagnostics, such as blood glucose testing, should therefore be available in primary health care settings. Patients will need periodic specialist assessment or treatment for complications. A series of cost-effective interventions can improve patient outcomes, regardless of what type of diabetes they may have. These interventions include blood glucose control through a combination of diet, physical activity and, if necessary, medication; control of blood pressure and lipids to reduce cardiovascular risk and other complications; and regular screening for damage to the eyes, kidneys and feet to facilitate early treatment.

Urban health,https://www.who.int/health-topics/urban-health,"Urbanization is one of the leading global trends of the 21st century that has a significant impact on health. Over 55% of the world’s population live in urban areas – a proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050. As most future
    urban growth will take place in developing countries, the world today has a unique opportunity to guide urbanization and other major urban development trends in a way that protects and promotes health. This is important, not least because the health
    and well-being of citizens is perhaps a city’s most important asset. However, most of the 4.2 billion people living in cities suffer inadequate housing and transport, poor sanitation and waste management, and air quality that fails WHO guidelines. Other forms of pollution, such as noise, water and soil contamination,
    so-called urban heat islands, and a lack of space for walking, cycling and active living further combine to make cities epicentres of a noncommunicable disease epidemic and drivers of climate change. WHO Repository on Urban Health     Around 40% of urban growth is in slums that lack safe water and sanitation, and 91% of people in urban areas breathe polluted air. When it comes to healthy diets, urbanization increases the distance from farm to fork, driving demand for unhealthy, processed foods. Urban dwellers are also highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change because of their dependence on fossil fuels for transport, cooking and heating. Cities account for over two thirds of the world’s energy and emit 60% of greenhouse gases, and those inland may experience temperatures 3–5º C higher than surrounding rural areas because of their large expanses of concrete and limited open green spaces. All of this puts urban dwellers’ health at risk. Most the top 10 causes of death are closely related to rapid and unplanned urbanization, and poor urban design and planning. Cities face the triple health burden of infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, pneumonia, dengue and diarrhoea; noncommunicable diseases like heart disease, stroke, asthma, cancer, diabetes and depression; and violence and injuries, including road traffic injuries.        Despite their challenges, cities can create opportunities for better health, cleaner environments and climate action. Strong urban policies must prioritize health, as it is essential for fostering good urban livelihoods, building a productive workforce, creating resilient and vibrant communities, enabling mobility, promoting social interaction and protecting vulnerable populations. WHO’s approach to urban health focuses on better air quality, water and sanitation, and other environmental determinants; healthy urban planning; healthier and smoke-free environments; safe and healthy mobility; preventing violence and injuries; promoting healthy food systems and diets; environmental management of vector-borne diseases; and urban preparedness for emergencies. Working across sectors and ensuring the coherence of policies across different areas is key to creating supportive and enabling environments for health, which ensures that health and equity considerations are integrated throughout the planning process, investments and policy decisions at the local level. To help Member States address the above priorities, WHO works to strengthen the evidence base to help policy-makers make informed decisions when addressing health risks. It provides tools and guidance on what works, and supports monitoring of key health-related indicators. WHO leads and engages in fostering city-to-city exchanges and helps develop institutional and policy frameworks for good urban governance for health and well-being in cities.

Lymphatic filariasis (Elephantiasis),https://www.who.int/health-topics/lymphatic-filariasis,"Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a painful and profoundly disfiguring disease. It is caused by infection with parasites classified as nematodes (roundworms) of the family Filariodidea that are transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitos. Mosquito-transmitted larvae are deposited on the skin from where they can enter the body. The larvae then migrate to the lymphatic vessels where they develop into adult worms, thus continuing a cycle of transmission. In communities where filariasis is transmitted, all ages are affected. While the infection may be acquired during childhood its visible manifestations such as limbs oedema may occur later in life, causing temporary or permanent disability. In endemic countries, lymphatic filariasis has a major social and economic impact. Lymphatic filariasis affects over 120 million people in 72 countries throughout the tropics and sub-tropics of Asia, Africa, the Western Pacific, and parts of the Caribbean and South America.         Whereas the disease was once thought to affect only adults, it now appears that most infections are acquired in childhood. Initial infection is followed by a long period of subclinical disease, which progresses in later life to clinically manifest disease.
    Lymphatic filariasis can cause of variety of clinical manifestations, that can be grouped in three categories: acute attacks, lymphoedema/elephantiasis and hydrocoele. The adult filarial worms cause inflammation of the lymphatic system leading to lymphatic vessel damage, even in asymptomatic people, and lymphatic dysfunction, which predispose the lower limbs in particular to recurrent bacterial infection. These secondary
    infections provoke “acute attacks”, which are the commonest symptom of lymphatic filariasis and play an important role in the progression of lymphoedema. Acute attack is usually associated with local pain and swelling and with fever and
    chills. Lymphoedema and its more advanced form, elephantiasis, occur primarily in the lower limbs and are commoner in women. In its most advanced form, elephantiasis may prevent people from carrying out their normal daily activities. Lymphatic filariasis may
    also evolve towards a genital disease (hydrocoele) that is characterized by a swelling of the scrotum and penis. The vast majority of infected people are asymptomatic, but virtually all of them suffer from damages to the lymphatic system and the kidneys, and from an altered body's immune system. People infected with filariasis who have microfilaraemia or a positive antigen test should receive antifilarial drug treatment to eliminate microfilariae. Unfortunately, the medicines available have limited effect on adult worms. Treatment also involves
    the management of morbidity and disability prevention (MMDP) that includes simple hygiene measures, such as basic skin care and exercise, to prevent acute attacks and progression of lymphoedema to elephantiasis. For management of hydrocoele, surgery may be appropriate. MMDP includes also psychological and socioeconomic
    support for people with disabling conditions to ensure that they have equal access to rehabilitation services and opportunities for health, education and income. Activities beyond medical care and rehabilitation include promoting positive attitudes
    towards people with disabilities, preventing the causes of disabilities, providing education and training, supporting local initiatives, and supporting micro- and macro-income-generating schemes. Preventive chemotherapy is used at the community level to eliminate microfilariae from the blood of infected individuals in order to interrupt transmission of infection by mosquitoes.

Tetanus,https://www.who.int/health-topics/tetanus,"Tetanus is a serious illness contracted through exposure to the spores of the bacterium, Clostridium tetani , which live in soil, saliva, dust and manure. The bacteria can enter the body through a deep cuts, wounds or burns affecting the nervous system. The infection leads to painful muscle contractions, particularly of the jaw and neck muscle, and is commonly known as “lockjaw”. People of all ages can get tetanus but the disease is particularly common and serious in newborn babies and their mothers when the mother is unprotected from tetanus by the vaccine, tetanus toxoid. Tetanus occurring during pregnancy or within 6 weeks of the end of pregnancy is called maternal tetanus, while tetanus occurring within the first 28 days of life is called neonatal tetanus. The disease remains an important public health problem in many parts of the world, but especially in low-income countries or districts, where immunization coverage is low and unclean birth practices are common. WHO estimates that in 2018 (the latest year for which estimates are available), 25 000 newborns died from neonatal tetanus, 88% reduction from the situation in 2000.         Nearly all cases of tetanus occur in people who have never been vaccinated or in adults who have not kept up to date on their booster shots. Signs and symptoms of tetanus appear anytime from 3 to 21 days after tetanus bacteria enter the body through a wound. Most cases occur within 14 days. Symptoms can include: jaw cramping or the inability to open the mouth muscle spasms often in the back, abdomen and extremities sudden painful muscle spasms often triggered by sudden noises trouble swallowing seizures headache fever and sweating changes in blood pressure or fast heart rate. In neonatal tetanus, symptoms include muscle spasms, which are often preceded by the newborn’s inability to suck or breastfeed, and excessive crying. Tetanus is diagnosed on the basis of clinical features and does not require laboratory confirmation. Tetanus requires treatment in a medical facility, often in a referral hospital. People who recover from tetanus do not have natural immunity and can be infected again and therefore need to be immunized.     Tetanus can be prevented through immunization with tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines (TTCV), which are included in routine immunization programmes globally and administered during antenatal care contacts. To be protected throughout life, WHO recommends that an individual receives 6 doses (3 primary plus 3 booster doses) of TTCV. The 3-dose primary series should begin as early as 6 weeks of age, with subsequent doses given with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses. The 3 booster doses should preferably be given during the second year of life (12–23 months), at 4–7 years of age, and at 9–15 years of age. Ideally, there should be at least 4 years between booster doses. There are many kinds of vaccines used to protect against tetanus: diphtheria and tetanus (DT) vaccines diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough) (DTaP) vaccines tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccines tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccines. Neonatal tetanus can be prevented by immunizing women of reproductive age with TTCV, either during pregnancy or outside of pregnancy. Additionally, robust medical practices can also prevent tetanus disease including clean delivery and cord care during childbirth, and proper wound care for surgical and dental procedures.

Health accounts,https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-accounts,"The system of health accounts is an international accounting framework for systematically tracking health spending. Time trends of overall health spending and its components guide future policies and investments to make health systems more responsive to people’s needs. They are essential for improving the performance of health systems while enhancing transparency and accountability. Health expenditure data also provide insights for assessing the adequacy of health resources, evaluating the efficiency, effectiveness, and equity of resource allocations, benchmarking against peers, and monitoring the progress towards the key goals of universal health coverage and health security. Accordingly, the demand for timely, accurate, and comprehensive data on health expenditures has been increasing at both the country and global levels. “A System of Health Accounts 2011” (SHA 2011) establishes an integrated and comprehensive methodology for tracking health expenditure through a set of uniform accounts comparable across countries. The framework, which focuses on final consumption, tracks resource flows through the health system: from its sources (funding sources, financial arrangements), patterns of provision (providers and factors of provision), and through to its use (health care functions, diseases/programs).      WHO works closely with partners to establish and institutionalize harmonized, integrated mechanisms for the routine and timely collection and publication of health expenditure data, as well as using health accounts information in policymaking. At a technical level. WHO has developed methodologies, practical guidance, and IT tools, and provides direct technical support. At an institutional level, it involves efforts to help countries build their capacity to undertake such functions.

Smallpox,https://www.who.int/health-topics/smallpox,"Smallpox is an acute contagious disease caused by the variola virus, a member of the orthopoxvirus family. It was one of the most devastating diseases known to humanity and caused millions of deaths before it was eradicated. It is believed to have existed
    for at least 3000 years. The smallpox vaccine, created by Edward Jenner in 1796, was the first successful vaccine to be developed. He observed that milkmaids who previously had caught cowpox did not catch smallpox and showed that a similar inoculation could be used to prevent
    smallpox in other people. The World Health Organization launched an intensified plan to eradicate smallpox in 1967. Widespread immunization and surveillance were conducted around the world for several years. The last known natural case was in Somalia in 1977. In 1980 WHO declared
    smallpox eradicated – the only infectious disease to achieve this distinction. This remains among the most notable and profound public health successes in history.         Early symptoms of smallpox include high fever, fatigue and severe back pain, and less often, abdominal pain and vomiting. Two to 3 days later the virus produces a characteristic rash with bumps full of a clear liquid, which later fill with pus and finally
    develop a crust that dries and falls off. The rash begins on the face and hands, then spreads to the rest of the body. Lesions develop in the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth and ulcerate soon after formation. Smallpox is transmitted from person to person via infective droplets during close contact with infected people who have symptoms of the disease, or in some cases through contaminated clothing and bedding. It has an incubation period of 7–17 days
    after exposure and only becomes infectious once a fever develops. People remain infectious until the last scabs fall off. Smallpox was fatal in up to 30% of cases. WHO smallpox recognition card    The period since eradication has been defined by a lengthy and complex debate focussed on the destruction of the last remaining stocks of live variola virus. In 1996, at the 49th World Health Assembly, Member States decided to have this stock destroyed
    in June 1999, and only to allow small samples to be kept for research purposes at two designated secure laboratories – one in the United States and one in the Russian Federation. Temporary retention of the existing stocks of variola virus are
    used for further essential research, which is overseen by the Advisory Committee for Variola Virus Research. This group meets on an annual basis. The WHO Smallpox Secretariat based in WHO Headquarters coordinates all smallpox eradication-related and post-eradication activities. These include overseeing permitted research with live variola virus for the development of countermeasures such as vaccine and antivirals. Since the eradication era, safer vaccines and specific treatments have been developed for smallpox and related diseases such as monkeypox . The Secretariat is also responsible for emergency preparedness and manages a smallpox vaccine emergency stockpile in the unlikely event that the disease re-emerges. The Secretariat manages the biosafety and biosecurity inspections of the authorized variola virus repositories as mandated by the World Health Assembly, and ensures annual reporting to WHO Governing Bodies.

Sepsis,https://www.who.int/health-topics/sepsis,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body’s response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. It is frequently a final common pathway to death for many infectious diseases worldwide. It involves organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection and if not recognized early and managed promptly, it can lead to septic shock, multiple organ failure and death. Although a precise estimate of the global epidemiological burden of sepsis is difficult to ascertain, a recent scientific publication reported that sepsis affects an estimated 49 million people and causes 11 million deaths globally every year. In the community setting, sepsis often presents as the clinical deterioration of common and preventable infections. Sepsis also frequently results from infections acquired in health care settings, which are one of the most frequent adverse events during care delivery and affect hundreds of millions of patients worldwide every year. If sepsis develops during pregnancy, while or after giving birth, or after an abortion, it is called maternal sepsis. Sepsis in newborn babies is called neonatal sepsis. Despite being highly preventable, maternal and neonatal sepsis continues to be a major cause of death for pregnant women and newborn babies.         Sepsis is a medical emergency and requires immediate attention to prevent further complications or death. It may present different warning signs and symptoms at times, some of which may cause misidentification with other conditions. A septic infection may cause a fever, but may also cause low body temperature, cold extremities and shivering. There may be difficulty breathing or rapid breathing, as well as an increased heart rate, or conversely a weak pulse and low blood pressure. It may cause low urine output, as well as blue-tinted, mottled or abnormally pale skin, and an altered mental state. Finally, it may cause extreme body pain or discomfort, which makes it easy to confuse for influenza or food poisoning. In children, sepsis may present through very fast breathing, convulsions, pale skin, lethargy or difficulty waking up or feeling abnormally cold to the touch. For children under 5 years, it may cause difficulty feeding, repeated vomiting or a lack of urination. Suspecting sepsis and acting quickly is crucial for early recognition and diagnosis. Early identification of symptoms and timely establishment of appropriate clinical management are critical elements to reducing the risk and impact of sepsis. The detection of some biomarkers, such as C reactive protein and procalcitonin, can be effective in diagnosing the condition. After early recognition, diagnostics to help identify a causal pathogen of infection leading to sepsis are important to guide targeted antimicrobial treatment. The appropriate antimicrobial therapy (for example, antibiotics and antifungals) should be given within one hour of sepsis identification. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) can jeopardize clinical management of sepsis because empirical antibiotic treatment is often required. Early fluid resuscitation is important in the initial phase and vasopressors may be required to improve and maintain tissue perfusion. There are two main steps to preventing sepsis: Prevention of microbial transmission and infection Prevention of an infection evolving into sepsis Within the community, sepsis prevention is assisted through the use of effective hygiene practices, improving sanitation and water quality and availability, providing access to vaccines, particularly for those at high risk, as well as appropriate nutrition, including breastfeeding for newborns. Prevention in health care facilities relies on infection prevention and control (IPC) programmes, effective hygiene practices, and clean, well-functioning equipment.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs),https://www.who.int/health-topics/sexually-transmitted-infections,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are spread predominantly by unprotected sexual contact. Some STIs can also be transmitted during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding and through infected blood or blood products. STIs have a profound impact on health. If untreated, they can lead to serious consequences including neurological and cardiovascular disease, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirths, and increased risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). They are
    also associated with stigma, domestic violence, and affects quality of life. The majority of STIs have no symptoms. When they are present common symptoms of STIs are vaginal or urethral discharge, genital ulcer and lower abdominal pain. The most common and curable STIs are trichomonas, chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis. Rapidly increasing antimicrobial resistance is a growing threat for untreatable gonorrhoea. Viral STIs including HIV, genital herpes simplex virus (HSV), viral hepatitis B, human papillomavirus (HPV) and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) lack or have limited treatment options. Vaccines are available for hepatitis B to prevent
    infection that can lead to liver cancer and for HPV to prevent cervical cancer. HIV, HSV and HTLV-1 are lifelong infections: for HIV and HSV there are treatments that can suppress the virus, but currently there are no cures for any of these viral STIs. Condoms used correctly and consistently are effective methods to protect against STIs and HIV. Screening with early diagnosis of people with STIs and their sexual partners offers the best opportunity for effective treatment and for preventing complications
    and further transmission.         A person can have an STI without having obvious symptoms of disease. When present, common symptoms of STIs include: abnormal vaginal discharge, urethral discharge, genital ulcers and lumps, and lower abdominal pain. Symptoms of specific STIs are: Gonorrhoea and chlamydial infection These STIs cause cervicitis in women, urethritis in men and extra-genital infections, including rectal and oropharyngeal manifestations. Common symptoms include vaginal or penile discharge and burning with urination. Infants of infected mothers can
    contract neonatal conjunctivitis (red eyes) due to exposure to the STIs during vaginal delivery. Rectal and pharyngeal infections can be asymptomatic. Syphilis Syphilis is often asymptomatic, when symptoms occur, primary syphilis presents as a solitary, painless ulcer. Secondary syphilis may manifest as generalized lesions affecting skin, mucous membranes and lymph-node including a classic rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Latent syphilis is asymptomatic and characterized by positive syphilis serology. Trichomoniasis The predominant symptoms include abnormal vaginal discharge with redness of the vulva, itching and painful intercourse. Genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) HSV most commonly presents as painful sores, vesicles or ulcerations on the external genitalia and mouth. Symptomatic genital HSV is a lifelong condition
 that can be characterized by frequent symptomatic recurrences. Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Generally asymptomatic, the chronic form of HTLV-1 can cause severe disease, including adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL) and a progressive nervous system condition known as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy or tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Effective treatment is currently available for several STIs. Three bacterial STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis) and one parasitic STI (trichomoniasis) are usually curable with existing, effective single-dose or multiple-dose regimens of antibiotics. For viral STIs (HIV, HSV and HTLV-1), the most effective medications available are antivirals or anti-cancer drugs (in the case of HTLV-1), that can modulate the course of the diseases, though they cannot cure these three diseases. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to antibiotics used to treat STIs, in particular gonorrhoea, has increased rapidly in recent years and has reduced successful treatment outcomes. Results from the current Gonococcal AMR Surveillance Programme (GASP) show trends of high rates of quinolone resistance, increasing azithromycin resistance and emerging resistance of extended-spectrum cephalosporins. The emergence of decreased susceptibility of gonorrhoea to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, together with established high-levels of resistance to penicillins, sulphonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones and macrolides make gonorrhoea a multidrug-resistant organism. AMR for other STIs, though less common, also exists, making prevention and prompt treatment critical. To adequately treat STIs it is important to take the appropriate antimicrobials, with the correct dose   and duration for the specific STI to ensure adequate treatment or cure, and to prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance.

Health promotion,https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-promotion,"“Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve their health.” Health Promotion Glossary, 1998 A brief history of Health Promotion The first International Conference on Health Promotion was held in Ottawa in 1986, and was primarily a response to growing expectations for a new public health movement around the world. It launched a series of actions among international organizations, national governments and local communities to achieve the goal of ""Health For All"" by the year 2000 and beyond. The basic strategies for health promotion identified in the Ottawa Charter were: advocate (to boost the factors which encourage health), enable (allowing all people to achieve health equity) and mediate (through collaboration across all sectors). Since then, the WHO Global Health Promotion Conferences have established and developed the global principles and action areas for health promotion. Most recently, the 9th global conference (Shanghai 2016), titled ‘Promoting health in the Sustainable Development Goals: Health for all and all for health’, highlighted the critical links between promoting health and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Whilst calling for bold political interventions to accelerate country action on the SDGs, the Shanghai Declaration provides a framework through which governments can utilize the transformational potential of health promotion.                                                                   Good Governance Strengthen governance and policies to make healthy choices accessible and affordable to all, and create sustainable systems that make whole-of-society collaboration real. This approach is based on the rationale that health is determined by multiple factors outside the direct control of the health sector (e.g. education, income, and individual living conditions) and that decisions made in other sectors can affect the health of individuals and shape patterns of disease distribution and mortality. Health Literacy Improving health literacy in populations provides the foundation on which citizens are enabled to play an active role in improving their own health, engage successfully with community action for health, and push governments to meet their responsibilities in addressing health and health equity. Healthy Settings The settings approach has roots in the WHO Health for All strategy and, more specifically, the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion. Healthy Settings key principles include community participation, partnership, empowerment and equity. The Healthy Cities programme is the best-known example of a successful Healthy Settings programme. Social mobilization Bringing together all societal and personal influences to raise awareness of and demand for health care, assist in the delivery of resources and services, and cultivate sustainable individual and community involvement.         Promoting Healthier Populations The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provides a bold and ambitious agenda for the future. WHO is committed to helping the world meet the SDGs by championing health across all the goals. WHO’s core mission is to promote health, alongside keeping the world safe and serving the vulnerable. Beyond fighting disease, we will work to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, leaving no-one behind. Our target is 1 billion more people enjoying better health and well-being by 2023.  ",WHO
Mpox,https://www.who.int/health-topics/mpox,"Mpox (previously known as monkeypox) is a viral disease caused by an orthopoxvirus called monkeypox virus. It spreads mainly through close contact with someone who has mpox, causing a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes and fever. It can make people very sick and leave scars. The disease mainly spreads from person to person through close contact. This includes, but isn’t limited to, sexual contact. Transmission occurs through exposure to bodily fluids; lesions on the skin or on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth or throat; respiratory particles; and contaminated objects. In areas where animals carry the virus, mpox is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can spread from animals to humans. It's found in tropical rainforests in central, east and west Africa, where small mammals such as squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, and various species of monkeys may be carriers. Since May 2022, mpox has spread globally, with cases reported from countries without previously documented mpox transmission. The spread in most countries today is from people and not animals.         Mpox typically causes a fever, a rash resembling pimples or blisters and swollen lymph nodes.   Symptoms usually appear within a week of exposure but can take anywhere from 1 to 21 days to develop. The illness often begins with a feverish phase lasting 1 to 3 days with symptoms including intense headache, swollen lymph nodes back pain, muscle aches and severe fatigue. The first stage is followed by the skin eruption stage, lasting from 2 to 4 weeks. Lesions evolve from macules (lesions with a flat base) to papules (raised firm painful lesions) to vesicles (filled with clear fluid) to pustules (filled with pus), followed by scabs or crusts.  They can leave scars. For some people, the first symptom of mpox is the rash. Some people with mpox become very sick and it can even be fatal in some cases. Children, pregnant people and people with weak immune systems, including people living with HIV that is not well controlled, are at higher risk for serious illness and death due to complications from mpox.                                                                    Prevention and control of mpox rely on raising awareness in communities and educating health workers to prevent infection and stop transmission. Mpox vaccines also provide protection against infection and severe disease. WHO recommends the use of vaccines for those most at risk of exposure during outbreaks, including people who have had close contact with someone with mpox, and health workers. People who were vaccinated against smallpox in childhood may have some cross-protection against mpox. To prevent spread, close contact with people who have mpox or with contaminated materials should be avoided. Masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment should be worn while taking care of the sick, whether in a health facility or at home. Where animal-to-human transmission is possible, contact with sick or dead animals should be avoided, and all foods containing animal meat or parts must be properly cooked before consumption. Care of patients with mpox should focus on managing symptoms to make people feel better, and to prevent medical complications. Potential treatments against mpox are being developed and tested. ",WHO
Health financing,https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-financing,"Health financing is a core function of health systems that can enable progress towards universal health coverage by improving effective service coverage and financial protection. Today, millions of people do not access services due to the cost. Many others receive poor quality of services even when they pay out-of-pocket. Carefully designed and implemented health financing policies can help to address these issues. For example, contracting and payment arrangements can incentivize care coordination and improved quality of care; sufficient and timely disbursement of funds to providers can help to ensure adequate staffing and medicines to treat patients. WHO’s approach to health financing focuses on core functions: revenue raising (sources of funds, including government budgets, compulsory or voluntary prepaid insurance schemes, direct out-of-pocket payments by users, and external aid) pooling of funds (the accumulation of prepaid funds on behalf of some or all of the population) purchasing of services (the payment or allocation of resources to health service providers) In addition, all countries have policies on which services the population is entitled to, even if not explicitly stated by government; by extension those services not covered, are usually paid for by patients (sometimes called co-payments).   Health financing reforms cannot simply be imported from one country to another given the unique context of each country and its starting point in terms of health financing arrangements; the underlying causes of performance problems differ in each country and it is these causes which the reforms proposed in a health financing strategy must address. However, there are lessons from international experience that allow a number of guiding principles for reforms which support progress towards UHC, to be specified. These do not constitute a “how-to” guide, but rather a set of “signposts” that can be used to check whether reform strategies (and more importantly, reform implementation) create an appropriate incentive environment and hence are pointing and moving in the right direction in terms of objectives and goals. The guiding principles can be summarized as: moving towards predominant reliance on public funding sources reducing fragmentation in how funds are pooled or mitigating the consequences moving towards more strategic purchasing of health services, linking provider payments to data on their performance, and to the health needs of the populations they serve aligning coverage policies (benefits and copayments) explicitly with policy objectives.                             Experience demonstrates that real progress is possible in countries at all income levels. Each country’s pathway will differ depending on the local context, however the above lessons are essential for equitable and effective progress. Country experience should be looked at through the lens of the health financing functions, rather than labels, and can provide valuable lessons. Labels such as “social health insurance,” “community insurance,” or “tax-funded systems” have little meaning by themselves and hide the complex choices and options available to countries as they raise, pool, and use funds to ensure the availability and use of quality services. Health system financing is an essential component of UHC but progress toward UHC also requires coordinated actions across the pillars of the health system with particular attention to strengthening human resources for health.

Palliative care,https://www.who.int/health-topics/palliative-care,"Palliative care is a crucial part of integrated, people-centred health services. Relieving serious health-related suffering, be it physical, psychological, social, or spiritual, is a global ethical responsibility. Thus, whether the cause of suffering
    is cardiovascular disease, cancer, major organ failure, drug-resistant tuberculosis, severe burns, end-stage chronic illness, acute trauma, extreme birth prematurity or extreme frailty of old age, palliative care may be needed and has to be available
    at all levels of care. It is estimated that globally only 14% of patients who need palliative care receive it; to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3, working towards universal health coverage, countries have to strengthen palliative care services. WHO works with countries
    to include palliative care as a key part of their health systems. To improve equitable access to palliative care services, emphasis is given to a Primary Health Care approach. Assessment tools have been developed to measure progress made. Strong partnerships

Biological weapons,https://www.who.int/health-topics/biological-weapons,"Biological and toxin weapons are either microorganisms like virus, 
bacteria or fungi, or toxic substances produced by living organisms that
 are produced and released deliberately to cause disease and death in 
humans, animals or plants. Biological agents like anthrax, 
botulinum toxin and plague can pose a difficult public health challenge 
causing large numbers of deaths in a short amount of time. Biological 
agents which are capable of secondary transmission can lead to 
epidemics. An attack involving a biological agent may mimic a natural 
event, which may complicate the public health assessment and response. 
In case of war and conflict, high-threat pathogens laboratories can be 
targeted, which might lead to serious public health consequences. Biological
 weapons form a subset of a larger class of weapons sometimes referred 
to as unconventional weapons or weapons of mass destruction, which also 
includes chemical, nuclear and radiological weapons. The use of 
biological agents is a serious concern, and the risk of using these 
agents in a terrorist attack is thought to be increasing.                      With the occurrence of a potential, suspected or confirmed deliberate
 biological event, WHO would, upon the invitation of the affected Member
 State(s), work closely with the Member State government(s), other UN 
agencies, and other international partners as appropriate, support the 
event response, and assess and mitigate the public health 
consequences. These activities could include: working with relevant international or national organizations to better characterize the nature, scope and impact of the event; facilitating
 the public health investigation of the event, including referral to 
appropriate laboratories for confirmation and characterization of the 
pathogen; offering targeted training to public health responders; facilitating
 the identification and acquisition of necessary materials (such as 
personal protective equipment) appropriate to the event; supporting the continued delivery of essential health services; and developing guidance material specific to the pathogen or toxin in question.              WHO focuses on the possible public health consequences of an incident
 due to a biological agent, regardless of whether it is characterized as
 a deliberate act or a naturally occurring event. When a Member 
State is concerned about biological agents and wants to be better 
prepared, WHO advises strengthening public health surveillance and 
response activities, with an emphasis on: more effective 
national surveillance of outbreaks of illness, including alert and 
response systems at all levels that can detect diseases that may be 
deliberately caused; improved biosafety and biosecurity throughout the health sector; better
 communication between multiple sectors, including public health, animal
 health, water supply, food safety, poison control, civil protection, 
law enforcement, and security services; improved assessments of 
vulnerability, and effective communication about risks and threats to 
both professionals and the public; preparation for handling the psychosocial consequences of the deliberate use of pathogens to cause harm; and contingency plans for an enhanced response capacity by all sectors. WHO’s
 global alert and response activities and the Global Outbreak Alert and 
Response Network (GOARN) represent a major pillar of global health security 
aimed at the detection, verification and containment of epidemics. In 
the event of the intentional release of a biological agent, these 
activities would be vital to effective international containment 
efforts.                                          ",WHO
Food safety,https://www.who.int/health-topics/food-safety,"Access to enough safe and nutritious food is key to sustaining life and promoting good health. Unsafe food containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances can cause more than 200 different diseases, ranging from diarrhoea to cancers.
    Around the world, an estimated 600 million – almost 1 in 10 people – fall ill after eating contaminated food each year, resulting in 420 000 deaths and the loss of 33 million healthy life years (DALYs). Food safety, nutrition and food security are closely linked. Unsafe food creates a vicious cycle of disease and malnutrition, particularly affecting infants, young children, elderly and the sick. In addition to contributing to food and nutrition security,
    a safe food supply also supports national economies, trade and tourism, stimulating sustainable development. The globalization of food trade, a growing world population, climate change and rapidly changing food systems have an impact on the safety
    of food. WHO aims to enhance the capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats associated with unsafe food at the global and country levels. Learn about Nutrition and Food Safety and COVID-19     Foodborne diseases impede socioeconomic development by straining health care systems and harming national economies, tourism and trade. The burden of foodborne diseases to public health and to economies has often been underestimated due to underreporting
    and difficulty to establish causal relationships between food contamination and resulting illness or death. Children under 5 years of age carry 40% of the foodborne disease burden, with 125 000 deaths every year. The consumption and production of safe food have immediate and long-term benefits for people, the planet and the economy. Safe food is essential to human health and well-being, only food that is safe can be traded. Safe food allows for the uptake of nutrients
    and promotes long-term human development. When food is not safe, humans cannot develop, and the Sustainable Development Goals cannot be achieved. The 2019 World Bank report on the economic burden of the foodborne diseases indicated that US$ 110 billion is lost each year in productivity and medical expenses resulting from unsafe food in low- and middle-income countries. Unsafe or contaminated food
    leads to trade rejections, economic losses and food loss and waste, while safe food production improves economic opportunities by enabling market access and productivity.        WHO calls for the transformation of food systems to make food safe, healthy and sustainably produced for all the world population. WHO provides scientific advice and research to help develop international standards for food safety through the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/WHO Codex Alimentarius. WHO provides global leadership in facilitating investment and coordinated evidence-based action across multiple sectors. This supports Member States in building strong, sustainable and resilient national food control systems with a balance of responsibilities between the different stakeholders, including consumers. It does so through the implementation of WHO Global Strategy for Food Safety (2022–2030); monitoring the global burden of foodborne diseases and supporting countries in burden estimates; supporting stronger national food control systems by comprehensive assessments through the FAO/WHO food control system assessment tool; and helping implement adequate infrastructure to respond to food safety emergencies through the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN). WHO promotes safe food handling through the WHO Five keys to safer food and advocates for priorities and policies that move food safety forward globally, by convening with partners and the public through World Food Safety Day and global Food Safety Community of Practice.

The EMF Project encourages focused research to fill important gaps in knowledge and to facilitate the development of internationally acceptable standards limiting EMF exposure. Key objectives of the Project are to: provide a coordinated international response to concerns about possible health effects of exposure to EMF, assess the scientific literature and make a status report on health effects, identify gaps in knowledge needing further research to make better health risk assessments, encourage a focused research programme in conjunction with funding agencies, incorporate the research results into WHO's Environmental Health Criteria monographs where formal health risk assessments will be made on exposure to EMF, facilitate the development of internationally acceptable standards for EMF exposure, provide information on the management of EMF protection programmes for national and other authorities, including monographs on EMF risk perception, communication and management, and provide advice to national authorities, other institutions, the general public and workers, about any hazards resulting from EMF exposure and any needed mitigation measures.

Health budget,https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-budget,"Raising domestic public funds is essential for universal health coverage (UHC). No country has made significant progress toward UHC without increasing reliance on public revenues. Therefore, domestic tax systems that are essential to support country’s fiscal space expansion are central to the UHC agenda. While the level of revenues matter, the allocation and use of these revenues are two crucial elements in supporting effective progress toward UHC. Public Financial Management (PFM) systems are key enabling factors to support appropriate formulation, execution and accounting of government expenditure. In health, countries face challenges at all stages of the PFM cycle. Key questions include: How to align budget allocations with sector needs? How to ensure effective disbursement? How to make the budget system more accountable and transparent? As part of the Montreux Collaborative Agenda on Fiscal Space, PFM and Health Financing , WHO is supporting countries and partners in fostering dialogue between health and finance authorities, with the aim to strengthen domestic PFM systems and make budget practices more effective toward UHC.

In health, proactive engagement of health ministries in the budgeting process can facilitate alignment of budget allocations with sector priorities, as laid out in national health strategies and plans. The development of multi-year plans and budgets is likely to improve predictability in the sector’s resources. If the health budget is formulated according to sector goals or outputs and the execution rules align with this logic, it will make budgets more responsive to sector needs than if the formulation follows an input-based approach.

The global action plan aims to improve the lives of people with dementia, their families and carers, while decreasing the impact of dementia on communities and countries. It provides a comprehensive blueprint for action across seven areas: (1) making dementia a public health priority, (2) increasing dementia awareness, inclusion and friendliness; (3) reducing the risk of dementia; (4) improving diagnosis, treatment and care; (5) supporting dementia carers, (6) enhancing health information systems for dementia and (7) fostering research and innovation.

The health impacts of poor environmental conditions occur not only directly but also indirectly, through effects on food production, migration, economic instability and social inequalities. Urgent action is needed to transform how we live, work, produce, consume and govern. Strengthening primary prevention is essential, given the substantial reduction in disease burden it can offer, as well as the potential savings in healthcare costs and resources. Cross-sectoral collaboration is crucial in addressing the environmental determinants of health, including the health, energy, industry, agriculture and transport sectors. Integrating actions across these sectors often leads to significant co-benefits and cost reductions.     In 2016, 13.7 million of deaths, representing 24% of global fatalities, were attributed to modifiable environmental risks. This means nearly one in four global deaths are linked to environmental conditions. Almost all diseases are influenced by unhealthy environments, with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) – including heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases and cancers – being the most affected. Air pollution alone is responsible for millions of these deaths each year. Infectious diseases are also significantly impacted, with pathogens transmitted through unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene, and zoonoses rising due to ecosystem disruption. Additionally, antimicrobial resistance poses a growing threat, especially when wastewater and solid waste are not properly managed. Climate change is exacerbating health risks by increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including deadly heatwaves. The shifting distribution of climate-sensitive disease vectors is creating new patterns of infectious diseases. Climate change also affects food production and migration, further compounding health threats. Unsafe working conditions contribute to risks across all major disease categories. However, effective solutions exist to prevent disease and mitigate the potential burden on health systems. These solutions could significantly reduce the associated costs, which are increasingly becoming a pressing issue in many countries.        WHO’s efforts to advance the global agenda for creating healthier environments for healthier people include: providing leadership on key transitions: We guide critical transitions, such as those in energy and transportation, which are essential for mitigating environmental health risks. We also work to stimulate good governance practices that integrate health and environmental considerations across relevant sectors; promoting knowledge generation and dissemination: We facilitate the generation and sharing of evidence-based knowledge, establishing norms and guidelines that drive effective solutions. We steer research, monitor health risks, and assess the effectiveness of implemented solutions. This ongoing effort is crucial for identifying emerging threats and adapting strategies to mitigate their impact on public health; supporting capacity building and scaling action: We assist countries in strengthening their ability to address environmental health challenges by building local capacity and supporting scalable mechanisms for action. By fostering collaboration across sectors, we help countries to implement healthy and sustainable policies and programs that reduce risks and promote healthier communities; and building capacity for emergency preparedness and response: We work to strengthen emergency preparedness and response systems in case of environment-related incidents, such as natural disasters, pollution events, and outbreaks of diseases linked to environmental changes.

Health taxes,https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-taxes,"Health taxes are levied on products that have a negative public health impact, for example tobacco, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). These taxes are considered win-win-win policies because they save lives and prevent disease while advancing health equity and mobilising revenue for the general budget. They can also be used for specific priorities such as financing universal health coverage (UHC) or highly cost-effective yet underutilised population health measures. The aim of health tax policy is to reduce the consumption of products deemed risk factors for noncommunicable diseases by making them less affordable through higher prices. This is achieved with regular tax increases large enough to result in real price increases greater than economic growth. Excise taxes are the most effective tax measure for promoting health because they change the price a harmful product relative to other goods and can be easily increased over time. Consumption is reduced best with taxes based on the quantity (known as specific taxes) of an unhealthy product (such as packs of cigarettes) or its unhealthy ingredient (such as pure alcohol or sugar) rather than taxes based on the product’s value.     Raising health taxes is a SMART policy because it: S aves lives Tobacco, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages taxes are all effective and cost-effective ways of reducing consumption, preventing diseases and injuries and saving lives. M obilises revenue Health taxes can be a revenue booster over the short and medium term. Importantly, health taxation is also more inclusive and pro-growth than alternative sources of revenue. A ddresses health inequities In lower- and middle-income countries, lower socioeconomic status is associated with higher risk of noncommunicable diseases and higher rates of tobacco use and alcohol consumption. Accordingly, the net impact of health taxes is progressive once one fully accounts for the distribution of health benefits, income losses averted and reductions in catastrophic healthcare costs. R educes burdens on health systems An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure: health taxes are also a high-return investment in averted healthcare expenditure and increased workforce participation. T argets noncommunicable disease risk factors for the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. By targeting noncommunicable disease risk factors with health taxes, countries can progress their achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3.4, which calls for a one-third reduction of premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases by 2030.        Countries are increasingly interested in using health taxes to achieve their health, revenue and equity objectives but require assistance with framing, designing, implementing and administering these measures. WHO’s response leverages its unique methodological expertise, technical capacity and country-level relationships established over more than a decade of work on tobacco taxation. WHO divides its response into three interconnected areas of work. Technical assistance to help governments seeking to adopt, reform or evaluate health tax measures. This tailored assistance helps Member States address challenges raised by providing, for example, tax system diagnostics, country-specific modelling for the impact of health tax reforms and independent evaluations of industry arguments. Capacity building engages regulators and policymakers on an ongoing basis in their framing and prioritisation of health taxes including the development of plans for progressing, implementing and evaluating health tax policies. Global goods build on the latest evidence base to support country level work by defining best practices, guiding policy development, detailing technical requirements and providing data to support and benchmark policy progress.

Wildfires,https://www.who.int/health-topics/wildfires,"Wildfires are increasing around the globe in frequency, severity and duration, heightening the need to understand the health effects of wildfire exposure. The risk of wildfires grows in extremely dry conditions, such as drought, heat waves and during high winds. Wildfire smoke is a mixture of hazardous air pollutants, such PM 2.5 , NO 2 , ozone, aromatic hydrocarbons, or lead. In addition to contaminating the air with toxic pollutants, wildfires also simultaneously impact the climate by releasing large quantities of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. With climate change leading to warmer temperatures and drier conditions and the increasing urbanization of rural areas, the fire season is starting earlier and ending later. Wildfire events are getting more extreme in terms of acres burned, duration and intensity, and they can disrupt transportation, communications, water supply, and power and gas services.     Wildfires that burn near populated areas can have significant impact on the environment, property, livestock and human mortality and morbidity depending on the size, speed and proximity to the fire, and whether the population has advanced warning to evacuate. Wildfire smoke is a mixture of air pollutants of which particulate matter (PM) is the principal public health threat. PM 2.5 from wildfire smoke is associated with premature deaths in the general population, and can cause and exacerbate diseases of the lungs, heart, brain/nervous system, skin, gut, kidney, eyes, nose and liver. It has also been shown to lead to cognitive impairment and memory loss. Firefighters and emergency response workers are also greatly impacted by injuries, burns and smoke inhalation, particularly at high concentrations. More interdisciplinary research is warranted to understand the latent and long-term health effects of wildfire exposure on vulnerable populations (children, older people, pregnant people, chronically ill people), particularly for geographic areas enduring repeated and cyclical exposure to these wildﬁre events. The magnitude of the physical and human costs from wildfires can be reduced if adequate emergency prevention, preparedness, response and recovery measures are implemented in a sustainable and timely manner. Working with Member States, WHO helps to build resilient and proactive health systems that can anticipate the needs and challenges during emergencies, so that we can be more likely to reduce risks and respond effectively when needed. WHO works with partners in preparing, preventing, detecting, responding and recovering from emergencies and disasters, including environmental exposures, such as implementing early warning systems and issuing health and air quality advisories; containing the release of hazardous materials; assessing health needs of the community and infrastructure damage; restoring primary care services, like immunization, child and maternal health, and mental health; strengthening human resources for disaster management; collecting, analysing and disseminating information related to emergencies and disasters that are likely to occur in a region; establishing and managing stocks of relief supplies and equipment; calling for emergency funding to support health action; and developing national policies, recommendations and national emergency response plans.

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever,https://www.who.int/health-topics/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever,"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral haemorrhagic fever usually transmitted by ticks. It can also be contracted through contact with viraemic animal tissues (animal tissue where the virus has entered the bloodstream) during and immediately post-slaughter
    of animals. CCHF outbreaks constitute a threat to public health services as the virus can lead to epidemics, has a high case fatality ratio (10–40%), potentially results in hospital and health facility outbreaks, and is difficult to prevent and treat.
    CCHF is endemic in all of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and in Asia. The disease was first described in the Crimean Peninsula in 1944 and given the name Crimean haemorrhagic fever. In 1969 it was recognized that the pathogen causing Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as that responsible for an illness identified in 1956 in the
    Congo Basin. The linkage of the two place names resulted in the current name for the disease and the virus.         Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is usually 1–3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. Following contact with infected blood or tissues, the incubation period is usually 5–6 days, with a maximum of 13 days. Onset of symptoms is sudden and can include fever, muscle ache, dizziness, neck pain, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,
    abdominal pain and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After 2–4 days the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with
    detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement). Other clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and
    on the skin. The petechiae may give way to larger rashes called ecchymoses, and other haemorrhagic phenomena. There is usually evidence of hepatitis, and severely ill patients may experience rapid kidney deterioration, sudden liver failure or pulmonary
    failure after the fifth day of illness. Early intensive supportive care including fluid management and treatment of specific symptoms, can improve survival chance. There is currently no specific treatment approved for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30%, with death occurring in the second week of illness. In patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the ninth or tenth day after the onset of illness. It is difficult to prevent or control CCHF infection in animals and ticks as the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in domestic animals is usually not apparent. Furthermore, the tick vectors are numerous and widespread, so
    tick control with acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) is only a realistic option for well-managed livestock production facilities. There are no vaccines widely available for human or animal use. In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure
    to the virus.                                                                    ",WHO

But it is different from polio . AFM is not caused by polioviruses. What causes acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)? AFM can be caused by several different viruses. Researchers think that enteroviruses have been causing the recent increases in the number of children with AFM. AFM can also be caused by other viruses, including flaviviruses, herpesviruses, and adenoviruses. Most people with AFM had a mild respiratory illness or fever (like you would get from a viral infection ) before they got AFM. Who is more likely to develop acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)? Anyone can get AFM, but most cases (more than 90%) have been in young children. What are the symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)? Most people with AFM will suddenly have: Arm or leg weakness A loss of muscle tone and reflexes Some people also have other symptoms, including: Facial drooping/weakness Trouble moving the eyes Drooping eyelids Trouble swallowing Slurred speech Pain in the arms, legs, back, or neck Sometimes AFM can weaken the muscles that you need for breathing. This can lead to respiratory failure , which is very serious. If you get respiratory failure, you may need to use a ventilator (breathing machine) to help you breathe. If you or your child develops any of these symptoms, get medical care right away. How is acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) diagnosed? AFM causes many of the same symptoms as other neurologic diseases, such as transverse myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome . This can make it difficult to diagnose. To find out if you have AFM, your doctor may use: A neurologic exam , including looking at where there is weakness, poor muscle tone, and decreased reflexes An MRI to look at the spinal cord and brain Lab tests on the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid around the brain and spinal cord) Nerve conduction and electromyography (EMG) studies . These tests check nerve speed and the response of muscles to the messages from the nerves. It is important that the tests are done as soon as possible after the symptoms start. What are the treatments for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)? There is no specific treatment for AFM. A doctor who specializes in treating brain and spinal cord illnesses (neurologist) may recommend treatments for specific symptoms. For example, physical and/or occupational therapy may help with arm or leg weakness. Researchers do not know the long-term outcomes of people who get AFM. Can acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) be prevented? There is no specific way to prevent AFM. But you can take steps to prevent getting sick from a virus by: Washing your hands often with soap and water Avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch, including toys Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or upper shirt sleeve, not hands Staying home when sick Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus

Your child's adenoids can be enlarged, or swollen, for different reasons. It may just be that your child had enlarged adenoids at birth. Adenoids can also become enlarged when they are trying to fight off an infection. They might stay enlarged even after the infection is gone. What problems can enlarged adenoids cause? Enlarged adenoids can make it hard to breathe through the nose.  Your child might end up breathing only through the mouth. This may cause: A dry mouth , which can also lead to bad breath Cracked lips A runny nose Other problems that enlarged adenoids can cause include: Loud breathing Snoring Restless sleep Sleep apnea , a disorder that causes you to repeatedly stop breathing during sleep Ear infections How can enlarged adenoids be diagnosed? To find out if your child has enlarged adenoids, the health care provider will: Ask about your child's medical history, including asking about your child's symptoms Check your child's ears, throat, and mouth Feel your child's neck Since the adenoids are higher up than the throat, the provider cannot see them just by looking through your child's mouth.

The treatment depends on what is causing the problem. If the symptoms are not too bad, your child may not need treatment. If treatment is needed, your child may get nasal spray to reduce the swelling or antibiotics if the provider thinks that there is a bacterial infection. In some cases, your child may need an adenoidectomy. What is an adenoidectomy and why might I my child need one? An adenoidectomy is surgery to remove the adenoids. The provider may recommend this surgery if: Your child has repeated infections of the adenoids. Sometimes the infections can also cause ear infections and fluid buildup in the middle ear. Taking antibiotics doesn't get rid of a bacterial infection of the adenoids. The enlarged adenoids block the airways. If there is also a problem with the tonsils, your child will probably have a tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils) at the same time that the adenoids are removed. After having the surgery, your child usually goes home the same day. Your child will probably have some throat pain, bad breath, and a runny nose. It can take several days to feel all better.",MedlinePlus
Adhesions,https://medlineplus.gov/adhesions.html,"Adhesions are bands of scar-like tissue. Normally, internal tissues and organs have slippery surfaces so they can shift easily as the body moves. Adhesions cause tissues and organs to stick together. They might connect the loops of the intestines to each other, to nearby organs, or to the wall of the abdomen. They can pull sections of the intestines out of place. This may block food from passing through the intestine. Adhesions can occur anywhere in the body. But they often form after surgery on the abdomen. Almost everyone who has surgery on the abdomen gets adhesions. Some adhesions don't cause any problems. But when they partly or completely block the intestines , they cause symptoms such as: Severe abdominal pain or cramping Vomiting Bloating An inability to pass gas Constipation Adhesions can sometimes cause infertility in women by preventing fertilized eggs from reaching the uterus. No tests are available to detect adhesions.  Doctors usually find them during surgery to diagnose other problems. Some adhesions go away by themselves. If they partly block your intestines, a diet low in fiber can allow food to move easily through the affected area. If you have a complete intestinal obstruction, it is life-threatening. You should get immediate medical attention and may need surgery. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",MedlinePlus
Adrenal Gland Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/adrenalglandcancer.html,"Your adrenal, or suprarenal, glands are located on the top of each kidney. These glands produce hormones that you can't live without, including sex hormones and cortisol, which helps you respond to stress and has many other functions. A number of disorders can affect the adrenal glands , including tumors.   Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. Most adrenal gland tumors are benign.  They usually do not cause symptoms and may not require treatment. Malignant adrenal gland cancers are uncommon. Types of tumors include: Adrenocortical carcinoma - cancer in the outer part of the gland Neuroblastoma , a type of childhood cancer Pheochromocytoma - a rare tumor that is usually benign Symptoms depend on the type of cancer you have. Treatments may include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.",MedlinePlus
Adrenal Gland Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/adrenalglanddisorders.html,"What are adrenal glands? Your adrenal glands are two small organs that sit on top of each kidney. The adrenal glands make different types of hormones you need to stay alive and healthy. Hormones are chemicals that travel in your bloodstream and control how different parts of your body work. The adrenal glands make the hormones cortisol, aldosterone, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. They also make hormones that your body uses to make sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone). All of these hormones do many important jobs, including: Turning food into energy and managing blood sugar levels Balancing salt and water Keeping blood pressure normal Responding to illness and stress (your ""fight or flight"" response) Timing when and how fast a child develops sexually Supporting pregnancy What are adrenal gland disorders? When you have an adrenal gland disorder, your body makes too much or too little of one or more hormones. The symptoms depend on the type of problem you have and how much it affects the hormone levels in your body. There are many types of adrenal gland disorders, including: Addison's Disease - a condition in which the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol Cushing's Syndrome - a condition caused by too much cortisol in the body, often from taking steroid medicines for a long time Aldosterone-producing adenoma - a benign tumor (not cancer) that makes too much aldosterone and may cause serious high blood pressure Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma - an inherited condition causing different types of tumors that make adrenaline and other hormones. Some tumors may become cancerous. Adrenal gland cancer - cancerous tumors, including adrenocortical carcinoma and neuroblastoma Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) - a group of inherited disorders in which the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol. The most common type is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (also called CAH1) . In the United States, newborn babies get a blood test to see if they have CAH. People born with CAH may not have symptoms until childhood or later in life. What causes adrenal gland disorders? The cause of adrenal gland disorders depends on the type of disorder you have. Causes can include: Medicines such as steroids A problem in another gland, such as the pituitary gland . The pituitary gland releases hormones that affect how the adrenal glands work. Changes in genes (mutations). These changes can cause the adrenal glands to make too much or too little of one or more hormones. Infections In many cases the cause of the problem isn't clear. How are adrenal gland disorders diagnosed? Health care providers use different tests to check for adrenal disorders depending on your symptoms and health history.  For example, you may have tests of your blood, urine (pee), or saliva (spit).  These tests check your hormone levels. Your provider may order x-rays , CT scans , or MRI scans to look for tumors. What are the treatments for adrenal gland disorders? Different types of adrenal gland disorders have different treatments. They include medicines and surgery. Radiation therapy is sometimes a treatment for tumors. There are treatments to cure certain adrenal gland disorders. For other disorders, treatments can manage your symptoms.

Alcohol,https://medlineplus.gov/alcohol.html,"Many Americans drink alcohol at least occasionally. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans say that adults of legal drinking age should either not drink or drink in moderation. Drinking less is better for your health than drinking more. Also, there are some people who should not drink at all. If you are going to drink, it's important to know how alcohol affects you and how much is too much. How does alcohol affect the body? Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant. This means that it is a drug that slows down brain activity. It can change your mood, behavior, and self-control. It can cause problems with memory and thinking clearly. Alcohol can also affect your coordination and physical control. Alcohol also has effects on the other organs in your body. For example, it can raise your blood pressure and heart rate. If you drink too much at once, it could make you throw up. Why are the effects of alcohol different from person to person? Alcohol's effects vary from person to person, depending on a variety of factors, including: How much you drink How often you drink Your age Your sex Your genetics Your overall health Whether or not you have a family history of alcohol problems What is moderate drinking? For most women, moderate drinking is no more than 1 standard drink a day For most men, moderate drinking is no more than 2 standard drinks a day Even though moderate drinking may be safe for many people, there are still risks. Moderate drinking can raise the risk of death from certain cancers and heart diseases. What is a standard drink? In the United States, a standard drink is one that contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol, which is found in: 12 ounces of regular beer (5% alcohol content) 5 ounces of wine (12% alcohol content) 1.5 ounces or a ""shot"" of distilled spirits or liquor (40% alcohol content) Who should not drink alcohol? Some people should not drink alcohol at all, including those who: Are in recovery from an alcohol use disorder (AUD) Are are unable to control the amount they drink Are under age 21 Are pregnant or trying to become pregnant Are taking medicines that can interact with alcohol Have medical conditions that get can worse if you drink alcohol Are planning on driving Will be operating machinery or doing activities that require skill, coordination, and alertness If you have questions about whether it is safe for you to drink, talk with your health care provider. What is excessive drinking? Excessive drinking includes binge drinking and heavy alcohol use: Binge drinking is drinking so much at once that your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is 0.08% or more: For men, this usually happens after having 5 or more drinks within a few hours. For women, it is usually after about 4 or more drinks within a few hours. Heavy alcohol use means: For men, having more than 5 drinks on any day or more than 15 drinks per week. For women, having more than 4 drinks on any day or more than 8 drinks per week. Binge drinking raises your risk of injuries, car crashes, and alcohol overdose. It also puts you at risk of becoming violent or being the victim of violence. Heavy alcohol use over a long period of time may cause health problems such as: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) Liver diseases , including cirrhosis and fatty liver disease Heart diseases Increased risk of certain cancers Increased risk of injuries Heavy alcohol use can also cause problems at home, at work, and with friends. But treatment can help. NIH: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism",MedlinePlus
Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD),https://medlineplus.gov/alcoholusedisorderaud.html,"What is alcohol use disorder (AUD)? For most adults, moderate alcohol use is probably not harmful. However, about 18 million adult Americans have an alcohol use disorder (AUD).  This means that their drinking causes distress and harm. AUD can range from mild to severe, depending on the symptoms. Severe AUD is sometimes called alcoholism or alcohol dependence. AUD is a disease that causes: Craving - a strong need to drink Loss of control - not being able to stop drinking once you've started Negative emotional state - feeling anxious and irritable when you are not drinking What is binge drinking? Binge drinking is drinking so much at once that your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is 0.08% or more. For a man, this usually happens after having 5 or more drinks within a few hours. For a woman, it is after about 4 or more drinks within a few hours. Not everyone who binge drinks has an AUD, but they are at higher risk for getting one. What are the dangers of too much alcohol? Too much alcohol is dangerous. Heavy drinking can increase the risk of certain cancers. It may lead to liver diseases , such as fatty liver disease and cirrhosis . It can also cause damage to the brain and other organs. Drinking during pregnancy can harm your baby . Alcohol also increases the risk of death from car crashes, injuries, homicide, and suicide. How do I know if I have an alcohol use disorder (AUD)? You may have an AUD if you can answer yes to two or more of these questions: In the past year, have you: Ended up drinking more or for a longer time than you had planned to? Wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn't? Spent a lot of your time drinking or recovering from drinking? Felt a strong need to drink? Found that drinking - or being sick from drinking - often interfered with your family life, job, or school? Kept drinking even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends? Given up or cut back on activities that you enjoyed just so you could drink? Gotten into dangerous situations while drinking or after drinking? Some examples are driving drunk and having unsafe sex. Kept drinking even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious? Or when it was adding to another health problem? Had to drink more and more to feel the effects of the alcohol? Had withdrawal symptoms when the alcohol was wearing off? They include trouble sleeping, shakiness, irritability, anxiety , depression , restlessness, nausea , and sweating . In severe cases, you could have a fever , seizures , or hallucinations. If you have any of these symptoms, your drinking may already be a cause for concern. The more symptoms you have, the more serious the problem is. What should I do if I think that I might have an alcohol use disorder (AUD)? If you think you might have an AUD, see your health care provider for an evaluation. Your provider can help make a treatment plan , prescribe medicines, and if needed, give you treatment referrals.

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) Treatment,https://medlineplus.gov/alcoholusedisorderaudtreatment.html,"What is an alcohol use disorder? An alcohol use disorder (AUD) is drinking that causes distress and harm. It is a medical condition in which you: Drink alcohol compulsively Can't control how much you drink Feel anxious, irritable, and/or stressed when you are not drinking An AUD can range from mild to severe, depending on the symptoms. Severe AUD is sometimes called alcoholism or alcohol dependence. What are the treatments for alcohol use disorder? Most people with an alcohol use disorder can benefit from some form of treatment. Medical treatments include medicines and behavioral therapies. For many people, using both types gives them the best results. People who are getting treatment for AUD may also find it helpful to go to a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). If you have an AUD and a mental illness, it is important to get treatment for both. Some people may need intensive treatment for AUD. They may go to a residential treatment center for rehabilitation (rehab). Treatment there is highly structured. It usually includes several different kinds of behavioral therapies. It may also include medicines for detox (medical treatment for alcohol withdrawal) and/or for treating the AUD. Which medicines can treat alcohol use disorder? Three medicines are approved to treat AUD: Disulfiram causes unpleasant symptoms such as nausea and skin flushing whenever you drink alcohol. Knowing that drinking will cause these unpleasant effects may help you stay away from alcohol. Naltrexone blocks the receptors in your brain that make you feel good when you drink alcohol. It can also reduce your craving for alcohol. This can help you cut back on your drinking. Acamprosate helps you avoid alcohol after you have quit drinking. It works on multiple brain systems to reduce your cravings, especially just after you have quit drinking. Your health care provider can help you figure out if one of these medicines is right for you. They are not addictive, so you don't have to worry about trading one addiction for another. They are not a cure, but they can help you manage AUD. This is just like taking medicines to manage a chronic disease such as asthma or diabetes. Which behavioral therapies can treat alcohol use disorder? Another name for behavioral therapies for AUD is alcohol counseling. It involves working with a health care professional to identify and help change the behaviors that lead to your heavy drinking.: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps you identify the feelings and situations that can lead to heavy drinking. It teaches you coping skills, including how to manage stress and how to change the thoughts that cause you to want to drink. You may get CBT one-on-one with a therapist or in small groups. Motivational enhancement therapy helps you build and strengthen the motivation to change your drinking behavior. It includes about four sessions over a short period of time. The therapy starts with identifying the pros and cons of seeking treatment. Then you and your therapist work on forming a plan for making changes in your drinking. The next sessions focus on building up your confidence and developing the skills you need to be able to stick to the plan. Marital and family counseling includes spouses and other family members. It can help to repair and improve your family relationships. Studies show that strong family support through family therapy may help you to stay away from drinking. Brief interventions are short, one-on-one or small-group counseling sessions. It includes one to four sessions. The counselor gives you information about your drinking pattern and potential risks. The counselor works with you to set goals and provide ideas that may help you make a change. Is treatment for alcohol use disorder effective? For most people, treatment for an AUD is helpful. But overcoming an alcohol use disorder is an ongoing process, and you may relapse (start drinking again). You should look at relapse as a temporary setback, and keep trying. Many people repeatedly try to cut back or quit drinking, have a setback, then try to quit again. Having a relapse does not mean that you cannot recover. If you do relapse, it is important to return to treatment right away, so you can learn more about your relapse triggers and improve your coping skills. This may help you be more successful the next time. NIH: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism",MedlinePlus

Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency,https://medlineplus.gov/alpha1antitrypsindeficiency.html,"What is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency)? Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency, or AATD) is an inherited condition that raises your risk for lung and liver disease. If you have this condition, your body doesn't make enough alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). AAT is made by your liver. It helps protect your lungs from inflammation and irritating substances you might breathe in, such as smoke. If your liver doesn't make enough AAT, your lungs may be more easily damaged from smoking , pollution , or dust from the environment. This can lead to a serious lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). AAT deficiency may also cause a liver disease called cirrhosis . This is more common in children who have AAT deficiency. What causes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency)? AAT deficiency is a genetic disorder . That means it's caused by changes in your genes, which may also be called gene variants or mutations. Your genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. AAT deficiency is caused by changes in the SERPINA1 gene , which carries instructions for making the AAT protein. These gene changes are inherited from your parents, so AAT deficiency tends to run in families: If you have two mutated copies of the gene, it means you have a condition called AAT deficiency. People with this disorder have a higher risk of getting lung disease or liver damage before the age of 45. If you have one mutated copy of the gene, you are a carrier of AAT deficiency. In these cases, this means you are at slightly higher risk of developing lung disease, especially if you have other risk factors, such as being a smoker. You could still pass the mutated gene on to your children. There are a few gene changes that cause AAT deficiency. These gene changes can: Decrease the amount of AAT protein your liver makes. Prevent your liver from making any AAT. Affect the shape of the AAT protein so that it can't move out of your liver to protect your lungs. Over time, AAT builds up in your liver and causes damage. What are the symptoms of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency)? Some people who have AAT deficiency do not have any symptoms. For those who do, symptoms usually appear in people between 20 and 50 years old. These symptoms may include: Wheezing Shortness of breath , especially after exercise Chronic cough with phlegm (mucus) Repeated respiratory infections such as colds and the flu Chest pain Fatigue Faster-than-normal heartbeat when you stand up Vision problems Losing weight without trying Some people who have AAT deficiency may have liver damage. Signs of liver damage include jaundice (a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow) and swelling in your legs. Rarely, AAT deficiency can cause skin problems, such as painful lumps or patches. How is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency) diagnosed? Your health care provider may test you for AAT deficiency if you have: Symptoms of AAT deficiency A condition that could be related to AAT deficiency Relatives who have AAT deficiency Relatives who have a lung or liver disease that could be related to AAT deficiency AAT deficiency in babies often affects the liver. Your baby may need AAT testing if he or she has signs of liver disease such as jaundice or abnormal liver enzyme tests . A blood test can check the level of AAT protein in your blood. If the level is lower than normal, it is likely that you have AAT deficiency. A genetic test is the most certain way to check for AAT deficiency and should be done to confirm the results of the blood test. There are two types of genetic tests: A genotype test looks for the more common types of gene changes that can cause AAT deficiency. A phenotype test checks for changes in the AAT protein that change how it would normally work. If your lungs are affected, you may also have lung function tests to see how well your lungs are working. What are the treatments for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency)? There is no cure for AAT deficiency, but there are treatments to help with the symptoms and slow the lung damage it causes. Treatment options may include: Inhaled medicines to help you breathe better. Pulmonary rehabilitation . Oxygen therapy . Augmentation therapy, which is a lifelong treatment. It raises the levels of the AAT protein in your lungs, using ATT protein taken from the blood of donors. It helps slow down lung damage. It cannot prevent liver damage. Lung surgery or a lung transplant , if your lungs are severely damaged. Liver transplant , if your liver is severely damaged. To help prevent or delay lung damage, it is important to quit smoking (if you smoke) and avoid secondhand smoke , dust, and air pollution.

Alzheimer's Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/alzheimersdisease.html,"What is Alzheimer's disease? Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among older people. Dementia is a brain disorder that seriously affects thinking and memory skills. If you have AD, it can impair your ability to reason or learn new skills until it becomes difficult to complete daily activities. AD begins slowly over many years. It first involves the parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language. It may be mistaken for normal memory changes with aging. However, AD is not a normal part of aging. The brain changes from the disease lead to symptoms that get worse over time. What are the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease? People with AD may have trouble remembering recent events or the names of people they know. Behavior may vary from person to person and day to day. AD progresses in stages. Late-onset AD occurs in adults aged 65 and older, which is when most people develop the disease. Early-onset AD happens before age 65, which is not common. Some symptoms of AD can include: Getting lost in familiar places Repeating the same question Not recognizing family members Having trouble speaking, reading, or writing Not taking care of yourself, such as not bathing or eating poorly In AD, over time, symptoms get worse. Later on, people with AD may become anxious or aggressive or wander away from home. Eventually, they need total care. This can cause great stress for family members who must care for them. Who is more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease? Researchers don't fully understand what causes AD. Age is the biggest risk factor. Your risk is also higher if a family member has had the disease. Although people who develop Alzheimer's don't always have a history of the disease in their families. Researchers believe the causes of AD may be a combination of age-related changes in the brain, along with genetic, health, and lifestyle factors. Some medical conditions that are associated with a higher risk of AD include: Hearing loss Depression Mild cognitive impairment Concussion or other traumatic brain injury (TBI) A related problem, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), causes more memory problems than normal for people of the same age.  Many, but not all, people with MCI will develop AD. How is Alzheimer's disease diagnosed? Some health conditions can cause memory loss or symptoms like AD. Talk with your health care provider if you're having noticeable changes in your memory. To determine if your symptoms are related to AD and not normal aging or another health condition, your provider may: Review your medical history and any medicines you're taking Conduct tests to check your memory, thinking, and problem-solving skills Ask about changes in behavior or personality Do tests to rule out any medical or mental health conditions Refer you to a provider that specializes in caring for older adults Recommend a neurologist, a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the brain and nervous system What are the treatments for Alzheimer's disease? No treatment can stop the disease. However, some medicines may help keep symptoms from getting worse for a limited time. Can Alzheimer's disease be prevented? You can't change some risk factors, like your age. But changing certain lifestyle factors may promote your brain health and help you live a healthier lifestyle overall.

It happens when an eye fails to work properly with the brain.  The eye may look normal, but the brain favors the other eye.   In some cases, it can affect both eyes.  Causes include: Strabismus - a disorder in which the two eyes don't line up in the same direction Refractive error in an eye - when one eye cannot focus as well as the other, because of a problem with its shape.  This includes nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. Cataract - a clouding in the lens of the eye It can be hard to diagnose amblyopia.  It is often found during a routine vision exam. Treatment for amblyopia forces the child to use the eye with weaker vision.  There are two common ways to do this.  One is to have the child wear a patch over the good eye for several hours each day, over a number of weeks to months.  The other is with eye drops that temporarily blur vision.  Each day, the child gets a drop of a drug called atropine in the stronger eye.  It is also sometimes necessary to treat the underlying cause.  This could include glasses or surgery.

One group of these disorders is amino acid metabolism disorders. They include phenylketonuria (PKU) and maple syrup urine disease. Amino acids are ""building blocks"" that join together to form proteins. If you have one of these disorders, your body may have trouble breaking down certain amino acids. Or there may be a problem getting the amino acids into your cells. These problems cause a buildup of harmful substances in your body. That can lead to serious, sometimes life-threatening, health problems. These disorders are usually inherited. A baby who is born with one may not have any symptoms right away.

Anabolic Steroids,https://medlineplus.gov/anabolicsteroids.html,"What are anabolic steroids? Anabolic steroids are synthetic (man-made) versions of testosterone. Testosterone is the main sex hormone in men. It is needed to develop and maintain male sex characteristics, such as facial hair, deep voice, and muscle growth. Women do have some testosterone in their bodies, but in much smaller amounts. What are anabolic steroids used for? Health care providers use anabolic steroids to treat some hormone problems in men, delayed puberty , and muscle loss from some diseases. But some people misuse anabolic steroids. Why do people misuse anabolic steroids? Some bodybuilders and athletes use anabolic steroids to build muscles and improve athletic performance. They may take the steroids orally, inject them into muscles, or apply them to the skin as a gel or cream. These doses may be 10 to 100 times higher than doses used to treat medical conditions. Using them this way, without a prescription from a health care provider, is not legal or safe. What are the health effects of misusing anabolic steroids? Misuse of anabolic steroids, especially over a long period of time, has been linked to many health problems, including: Acne Stunted growth in teens High blood pressure Changes in cholesterol Heart problems , including heart attack Liver disease , including cancer Kidney damage Aggressive behavior In men, it can also cause: Baldness Breast growth Low sperm count/ infertility Shrinking of the testicles In women, it can also cause: Changes in your menstrual cycle (period) Growth of body and facial hair Male-pattern baldness Voice deepening Are anabolic steroids addictive? Even though they don't cause a high, anabolic steroids can be addictive. You can have withdrawal symptoms if you stop using them, including: Fatigue Restlessness Loss of appetite Sleep problems Decreased sex drive Steroid cravings Depression , which can sometimes be serious and even lead to suicide attempts Behavioral therapy and medicines can be helpful in treating anabolic steroid addiction.

Anal Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/analcancer.html,"What is anal cancer? Your anus is the opening at the end of your large intestine. It is where stool (poop) leaves your body. The anus is formed partly from your outer layers of skin and partly from your intestine. Anal cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the tissues of your anus. Who is more likely to develop anal cancer? Anyone can get anal cancer, but you are more likely to develop it if you: You have an infection with high-risk HPV , especially if you have certain types. Most anal cancers are related to HPV infection. Have a weakened immune system , from conditions such as HIV or because of medicines you need to take after an organ transplant . Have had vulvar , vaginal , or cervical cancer. Have many sexual partners. Have anal sex. Smoke cigarettes . What are the symptoms of anal cancer? The signs and symptoms of anal cancer may include: Bleeding from the anus or rectum A lump near the anus Pain or pressure in the area around the anus Itching or discharge from the anus A change in bowel habits , such as narrower stools, having to go more often, or bowel incontinence How is anal cancer diagnosed? To find out if you have anal cancer, your provider: Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. Will ask about your family health history. May do a digital rectal examination (DRE). A DRE is an exam of the anus and rectum. For the exam, your provider will insert a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of your rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. May order tests that examine the anus and rectum, such as: An anoscopy , an exam of the anus and lower rectum using a short, lighted tube called an anoscope. There is also a type of anoscopy called a high-resolution anoscopy. It uses a special magnifying device called a colposcope along with the anoscope to view these areas. A proctoscopy, a procedure to look inside the rectum and anus using a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens. An endo-anal or endorectal ultrasound , a procedure in which an ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum. May do a biopsy during an anoscopy or proctoscopy. What are the treatments for anal cancer? The treatments for anal cancer include radiation therapy , chemotherapy , and surgery. Which treatment you get will depend on how advanced the cancer is, your overall health, and your preferences. Can anal cancer be prevented? You may be able to lower your risk of getting anal cancer by getting an HPV vaccine and not smoking. Contact your provider if you need help quitting smoking . It is currently not known if using condoms can prevent anal HPV infections. But using latex condoms every time you have sex can help prevent HIV, a risk factor for anal cancer. And they also help prevent other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If your or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. If you are an adult with HIV, it's important to get an anal cancer screening every year.

Anesthesia may be used in minor procedures, such as filling a tooth. It could be used during childbirth or procedures such as colonoscopies . And it is used during minor and major surgeries. In some cases, a dentist, nurse, or doctor may give you an anesthetic. In other cases, you may need an anesthesiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in giving anesthesia. What are the types of anesthesia? There are several different types of anesthesia: Local anesthesia numbs a small part of the body. It might be used on a tooth that needs to be pulled or on a small area around a wound that needs stitches.  You are awake and alert during local anesthesia. Regional anesthesia is used for larger areas of the body such as an arm, a leg, or everything below the waist. You may be awake during the procedure, or you may be given sedation. Regional anesthesia may be used during childbirth, a Cesarean delivery (C-section), or minor surgeries. General anesthesia affects the whole body. It makes you unconscious and unable to move. It is used during major surgeries, such as heart surgery , brain surgery, back surgery, and organ transplants . What are the risks of anesthesia? Anesthesia is generally safe. But there can be risks, especially with general anesthesia, including: Heart rhythm or breathing problems An allergic reaction to the anesthesia Delirium after general anesthesia. Delirium makes people confused. They may be unclear about what is happening to them. Some people over the age of 60 have delirium for several days after surgery.

Aneurysms,https://medlineplus.gov/aneurysms.html,"An aneurysm is a bulge or ""ballooning"" in the wall of an artery. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to other parts of the body. If an aneurysm grows large, it can burst and cause dangerous bleeding or even death. Most aneurysms occur in the aorta , the main artery that runs from the heart through the chest and abdomen. Aneurysms also can happen in arteries in the brain, heart and other parts of the body. If an aneurysm in the brain bursts, it causes a stroke . Aneurysms can develop and become large before causing any symptoms.  Often doctors can stop aneurysms from bursting if they find and treat them early. They use imaging tests to find aneurysms.  Often aneurysms are found by chance during tests done for other reasons.   Medicines and surgery are the two main treatments for aneurysms. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Angina,https://medlineplus.gov/angina.html,"Angina is chest pain or discomfort you feel when there is not enough blood flow to your heart muscle. Your heart muscle needs the oxygen that the blood carries. Angina may feel like pressure or a squeezing pain in your chest. It may feel like indigestion. You may also feel pain in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina is a symptom of coronary artery disease (CAD), the most common heart disease . CAD happens when a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply blood to the heart, reducing blood flow. There are three types of angina: Stable angina is the most common type. It happens when the heart is working harder than usual. Stable angina has a regular pattern.  Rest and medicines usually help. Unstable angina is the most dangerous. It does not follow a pattern and can happen without physical exertion. It does not go away with rest or medicine. It is a sign that you could have a heart attack soon. Variant angina is rare. It happens when you are resting. Medicines can help. Not all chest pain or discomfort is angina.

Angioplasty,https://medlineplus.gov/angioplasty.html,"What is angioplasty? Angioplasty is a procedure to improve blood flow in coronary arteries that have become narrow or blocked. Your coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart. If you have coronary artery disease , a sticky material called plaque builds up in your coronary arteries. Plaque is made of cholesterol , calcium, and other substances in your blood. Over time, it can narrow your arteries or fully block them. When this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood. Angioplasty widens the blocked part of your artery so more blood can get through. It is also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). What conditions does angioplasty treat? Doctors (usually a heart specialist called a cardiologist) use angioplasty to: Reduce chest pain from blockages in the coronary arteries. This type of pain is called angina . There are different types of angina. Angioplasty treats certain types. Limit damage to the heart during or right after a heart attack . In this case, angioplasty is an emergency treatment. Angioplasty does not cure coronary artery disease. To help prevent more plaque blockages , you'll need to take any prescribed medicines, eat healthy foods, and get regular exercise . What happens during angioplasty? Most people have angioplasties in a hospital in a special room called a cardiac catheterization, or cath, lab. You will be awake and lying down. You'll get medicine to help you relax through an intravenous (IV) line. This is a small tube that goes into a vein in your hand or arm. Angioplasty is done through a blood vessel in your arm, wrist, or groin. Your doctor will: Make a small opening in that area to insert a thin tube (a catheter) into a blood vessel. Thread the tube through the vessel to your heart, using x-rays as a guide. Inject contrast dye inside your arteries. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the x-rays. Replace the first tube with another one that has a small, deflated balloon on the end. Guide the balloon inside the blockage and inflate it to push the plaque flat against the artery wall. This makes the artery wider and improves blood flow. Sometimes put a small, mesh tube into the artery to help keep it open. The tube is called a stent. Some stents have a coating of medicine that helps prevent blood clots from forming. What happens after an angioplasty? If you had an angioplasty for chest pain, you'll go to a recovery room for a few hours. You may stay in the hospital overnight. Your doctor will probably prescribe medicines to prevent blood clots . Most people can return to their usual activities after a week. If you had an emergency angioplasty for a heart attack, you'll need to stay in the hospital for about a few more days. Are there any risks from angioplasty? Angioplasty is very safe, but every invasive procedure comes with risks. You may get a bruise , feel sore, or have some bleeding where the tubes were inserted. More serious problems don't happen very often, but they are possible. They can include serious bleeding , blood clots, and narrowing of the artery again.

Ankylosing Spondylitis,https://medlineplus.gov/ankylosingspondylitis.html,"What is ankylosing spondylitis? Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of arthritis of the spine. It causes inflammation (swelling) between your vertebrae (the bones that make up your spine) and the joints between your spine and pelvis. AS inflammation can cause stiffness and make it difficult to move and bend. Symptoms of AS can range from mild to severe back pain. Over time, AS can fuse (grow together) your vertebrae, limiting movement and causing a hunched posture. In some people, AS can affect other joints or body parts. There is no cure for AS, but early treatment can help manage symptoms, slow down the disease, and help you lead a more productive life. Who is more likely to get ankylosing spondylitis? Ankylosing spondylitis usually starts before age 45. Early symptoms may begin between the ages of 15 and 30. Your chance of developing AS can also increase if: You're a man. AS is more common and severe in men. You have a family history. If a member of your family has AS, you're more likely to get the disease. You have other medical conditions that may increase your risk of getting AS. These include Crohn's disease , ulcerative colitis , or psoriasis . What causes ankylosing spondylitis? No one knows what causes ankylosing spondylitis, but the environment and genes likely play a role. Your genes are parts of DNA in your cells that are passed down from your parents. Certain genes may increase your risk of getting the disease, but not everyone with these genes gets AS. What are the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis? AS affects people differently. The most common symptom is pain and stiffness in the lower back and/or hips. The pain is usually worse during the night or after sitting for a long time. Over time, AS may progress to other areas of your spine or body. Symptoms may depend on which areas of your body the disease affects. Some people have symptoms that come and go. Others may have severe, ongoing pain. Other symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis may include: Pain, stiffness, and inflammation of the joints. Difficulty taking a deep breath. This could occur if the joints connecting the ribs are affected. Changes in vision. Fatigue . Loss of appetite. Weight loss. Skin rashes, such as psoriasis. Abdominal (belly) pain and loose stools (poop). How is ankylosing spondylitis diagnosed? There is no single test for ankylosing spondylitis. To find out if you have AS your health care provider may: Ask about your medical history , including your symptoms. Ask about your family health history , including relatives who have had AS. Do a physical exam. Order blood tests or imaging studies . What are the treatments for ankylosing spondylitis? AS has no cure, but treatment may help relieve symptoms, maintain posture, and slow down the disease. Since other parts of your body can be affected by AS, you will likely work with a team of health care professionals for tests, diagnosis, and care. Treatment usually includes medicine to help relieve symptoms and keep the disease from getting worse, as well as physical therapy to improve mobility. If AS is severe, surgery may be needed.

Antibiotic Resistance,https://medlineplus.gov/antibioticresistance.html,"What are antibiotics? Antibiotics are medicines that treat bacterial infections in humans and animals. They work by killing the bacteria or making it hard for the bacteria to grow and multiply. When used properly, antibiotics can save lives. But there is a growing problem of antibiotic resistance. What is antibiotic resistance? Antibiotic resistance happens when bacteria change and can resist the effects of an antibiotic. The bacteria are not killed, and they continue to grow. The infections these bacteria cause are called resistant infections. Resistant infections can be difficult, and sometimes impossible, to treat. In some cases, they can even be deadly. Antibiotic resistance does not mean that your body is resistant to antibiotics. There are many different types of resistant infections. They include MRSA and drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). If you get a resistant infection, you might need: A long hospital stay A long recovery Follow-up visits with health care providers Treatments that are expensive and may have severe side effects Antibiotic resistance is one type of antimicrobial resistance. There are other types; viruses , fungi , and parasites can also become resistant to medicines. How do bacteria become resistant to antibiotics? Antibiotic resistance is a natural process that happens over time. To survive, bacteria can develop defense strategies against antibiotics. This happens through genetic changes in the bacteria. These resistant bacteria survive, grow, and spread. Each time you take antibiotics, there is a risk that the bacteria will become resistant. So it is important to only take antibiotics when you really need them. They won't work on viral infections such as colds and the flu . And you don't need antibiotics for every bacterial infection. For example, you may not need them for some sinus and ear infections. Who is more likely to develop an antibiotic-resistant infection? Anyone can develop an antibiotic-resistant infection, but certain people may be at higher risk, including those who: Have a weakened immune system from diseases such as HIV or from taking medicines that affect the immune system Are getting medical care such as surgery and hospital stays Take antibiotics for a long time Are infants, especially if they were born prematurely Are older adults How can antibiotic resistance be prevented? There will always be some antibiotic resistance, since it happens naturally. But you can help fight against antibiotic resistance by taking these steps: Don't use antibiotics for viruses. Don't pressure your health care provider to give you an antibiotic if they don't think you need one. When you take antibiotics, follow the directions carefully. Don't share your antibiotics with others. Don't save antibiotics for later or use someone else's prescription. Help prevent the spread of bacterial infections with good hygiene habits .

Antidepressants,https://medlineplus.gov/antidepressants.html,"What are antidepressants? Antidepressants are prescription medicines to treat depression. Depression is more than feeling a little sad or ""blue"" for a few days. It's a very common, serious medical illness that affects your mood and general mental health It can make you feel tired, hopeless, worried, or fearful. It can change your thinking, sleeping, and eating. Depression may make some people think about ending their lives. But antidepressants can help many people who have depression. Researchers think antidepressants may help improve the way your brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress. Are antidepressants used for other conditions? A health care provider may prescribe antidepressants for anxiety , chronic pain , or insomnia . Sometimes providers also prescribe antidepressants for other conditions. What are the different types of antidepressants? There are many types of antidepressants. Each one works differently. Providers usually prescribe newer antidepressants first because they don't cause as many side effects as older types. They also seem to help more kinds of depression and anxiety problems. Most of the newer antidepressants belong to one of these three groups: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) Atypical antidepressants, which are newer antidepressants that don't fit into the other groups If these antidepressants don't help, your provider might suggest one of the older antidepressants. The older types include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclics, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Even though these antidepressants may cause more serious side effects, the benefits may outweigh the risks for some people. Which type of antidepressant is right for me? Our bodies and brains all work differently. That means one antidepressant won't work for everyone.  You may need to try two or more medicines before you find one that works for you. Your provider will work with you to choose the best option to try first. You'll consider questions such as: Which symptoms bother you most? Some antidepressants may do a better job helping specific symptoms, such as trouble sleeping. What other medicines and supplements do you take? Some antidepressants can cause problems if you take them with certain medicines and herbs. Did a certain antidepressant work well for a close relative? An antidepressant that helped a parent, brother, or sister could be a good choice for you, too. Do you have other health conditions? Certain antidepressants can make some other conditions better or worse. Any other conditions that you have will be part of choosing your depression treatment. Are you pregnant, planning for pregnancy, or breastfeeding? If so, your provider will help you find a way to treat your depression that's safe for you and your baby. How long do antidepressants take to work? Antidepressants usually take 4 to 8 weeks to work, so you'll need to be patient. You may notice that some problems, such as sleeping and eating, get better before your mood improves. That's a good sign. You may just need to give the medicine a little more time to do its job. Sometimes an antidepressant helps at first, but symptoms return while you're still taking it. But there's usually another one you can try. To get more relief from depression, your provider may suggest combining two antidepressants, using another kind of medicine with an antidepressant, or adding talk therapy or other approaches to improve your mental health . How long will I need to take an antidepressant? When an antidepressant starts to work, you and your provider can decide how long you need to stay on it. The typical length of treatment is 6 to 12 months, but some people may stay on antidepressants for much longer. What are the side effects of antidepressants? Not everyone has side effects from antidepressants. But if you do have them, they're usually mild and may get better over time as your body gets used to the new medicine. The most common side effects from antidepressants include: Nausea and vomiting Weight gain Diarrhea Sleepiness Sexual problems, such as a lack of desire or ability to have sex When thinking about side effects, it's important to remember that there are also risks from not treating depression. Your provider can help you think through the pros and cons of all your options. If you have any side effects from antidepressants, your provider may suggest ways to manage them while you wait to see if the antidepressant will work. If the side effects bother you too much, you may need to change antidepressants. But you should never change your dose or stop taking an antidepressant on your own. If you have serious problems or notice any changes that worry you, such as new or worsening symptoms, unusual changes in your mood, or you start acting differently, call your provider right away. In some cases, children, teenagers, and young adults under 25 may be more likely to think about hurting or killing themselves when starting antidepressants or when the dose is changed. Get medical help right away if this happens. What can I do to take antidepressants safely? Antidepressants are generally safe when you use them correctly: Tell your provider about everything you take. That includes medicines, herbs, supplements, and over-the-counter medicines you take, such as pain relievers and decongestants. Be honest about recreational drugs and alcohol, too. Try to get all your medicines from the same pharmacy. That way the pharmacist can warn you and your provider if you take medicines that may cause problems when used together. Follow all instructions about how to take your medicine. Talk with your provider if side effects bother you. Never stop taking antidepressants without your provider's help. Stopping too fast may make depression come back. You could even make your condition worse. To stop antidepressants safely, you need to give your body time to get used to being without the medicine. Your provider can tell you the safest way to go off an antidepressant. NIH: National Institute of Mental Health",MedlinePlus

But it isn't clear whether this is because of the antioxidants, something else in the foods, or other factors. High-dose supplements of antioxidants may be linked to health risks in some cases. For example, high doses of beta-carotene may increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers. High doses of vitamin E may increase risks of prostate cancer and one type of stroke. Antioxidant supplements may also interact with some medicines. To minimize risk, tell your health care providers about any antioxidants you use.

Anxiety,https://medlineplus.gov/anxiety.html,"What is anxiety? Anxiety is a feeling of fear, dread, and uneasiness. It might cause you to sweat, feel restless and tense, and have a rapid heartbeat.   It can be a normal reaction to stress. For example, you might feel anxious when faced with a difficult problem at work, before taking a test, or before making an important decision. It can help you to cope. The anxiety may give you a boost of energy or help you focus. But for people with anxiety disorders, the fear is not temporary and can be overwhelming. What are anxiety disorders? Anxiety disorders are conditions in which you have anxiety that does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships. What are the types of anxiety disorders? There are several types of anxiety disorders, including: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). People with GAD worry about ordinary issues such as health, money, work, and family. But their worries are excessive, and they have them almost every day for at least 6 months. Panic disorder . People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden, repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and can last several minutes or more. Phobias . People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Their fear may be about spiders, flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations (known as social anxiety). What causes anxiety disorders? The cause of anxiety is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, stress , and your environment may play a role. Who is at risk for anxiety disorders? The risk factors for the different types of anxiety disorders can vary. For example, GAD and phobias are more common in women, but social anxiety affects men and women equally. There are some general risk factors for all types of anxiety disorders, including: Certain personality traits, such as being shy or withdrawn when you are in new situations or meeting new people Traumatic events in early childhood or adulthood Family history of anxiety or other mental disorders Some physical health conditions, such as thyroid problems or arrhythmia What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders? The different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms. But they all have a combination of: Anxious thoughts or beliefs that are hard to control. They make you feel restless and tense and interfere with your daily life. They do not go away and can get worse over time. Physical symptoms, such as a pounding or rapid heartbeat, unexplained aches and pains, dizziness , and shortness of breath Changes in behavior, such as avoiding everyday activities you used to do Using caffeine , other substances, and certain medicines can make your symptoms worse. How are anxiety disorders diagnosed? To diagnose anxiety disorders, your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and medical history. You may also have a physical exam and lab tests to make sure that a different health problem is not the cause of your symptoms. If you don't have another health problem, you will get a psychological evaluation . Your provider may do it, or you may be referred to a mental health professional to get one. What are the treatments for anxiety disorders? The main treatments for anxiety disorders are psychotherapy (talk therapy), medicines, or both: Psychotherapy can help you recognize and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. To be effective, it should focus on your specific anxieties and needs. There are many types; some of the types used for anxiety disorders include: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which teaches you different ways of thinking and behaving. It can help you change how you react to the things that cause you to feel fear and anxiety. It may include exposure therapy. This therapy focuses on having you confront your fears so that you will be able to do the things that you had been avoiding. Acceptance and commitment therapy may help with some anxiety disorders. It uses strategies such as mindfulness and goal setting to reduce discomfort and anxiety. Medicines to treat anxiety disorders include anti-anxiety medicines and certain antidepressants . Some types of medicines may work better for specific types of anxiety disorders. You should work closely with your provider to identify which medicine is best for you. You may need to try more than one medicine before you can find the right one. Support groups and stress management techniques may also be helpful.

Aortic Aneurysm,https://medlineplus.gov/aorticaneurysm.html,"An aneurysm is a bulge or ""ballooning"" in the wall of an artery. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to other parts of the body. If an aneurysm grows large, it can burst and cause dangerous bleeding or even death. Most aneurysms are in the aorta, the main artery that runs from the heart through the chest and abdomen. There are two types of aortic aneurysm: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) - these occur in the part of the aorta running through the chest Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) - these occur in the part of the aorta running through the abdomen Most aneurysms are found during tests done for other reasons. Some people are at high risk for aneurysms. It is important for them to get screening, because aneurysms can develop and become large before causing any symptoms. Screening is recommended for people between the ages of 65 and 75 if they have a family history, or if they are men who have smoked. Doctors use imaging tests to find aneurysms. Medicines and surgery are the two main treatments. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Aphasia,https://medlineplus.gov/aphasia.html,"What is aphasia? Aphasia is a language disorder that makes it hard for you to read, write, and say what you mean to say. Sometimes it makes it hard to understand what other people are saying, too. Aphasia is not a disease. It's a symptom of damage to the parts of the brain that control language. The signs of aphasia depend on which part of the brain is damaged. There are four main types of aphasia: Expressive aphasia is when you know what you want to say, but you have trouble saying or writing your thoughts. Receptive aphasia affects your ability to read and understand speech. You can hear what people say or see words on a page, but you have trouble making sense of what they mean. Global aphasia is the loss of almost all language ability. You can't speak, understand speech, read, or write. Anomic or amnesia aphasia is when you have trouble using the right words for certain things, people, places or events. In some cases, aphasia may get better on its own. But it can be a long-term condition. There's no cure, but treatment may help improve language skills. What causes aphasia? Aphasia happens from damage to one or more parts of the brain involved with language. The damage may be from: Stroke , which is the most common cause of aphasia Brain tumor Brain infection or inflammation Brain injury Other brain disorders or neurologic diseases that affect the brain and get worse over time, such as dementia Who is more likely to develop aphasia? Anyone can have aphasia at any age, but most people with aphasia are middle-aged or older. Most aphasia happens suddenly from a stroke or brain injury. Aphasia from a brain tumor or other brain disorder may develop slowly over time. How is aphasia diagnosed? If a health care provider sees signs of aphasia, the provider will usually: Test the person's ability to understand language and speech. This includes asking questions and checking to see if the person can follow simple commands. Order an imaging scan to see if there's a brain injury and what part of the brain is damaged. Possible tests include: MRI CT scan If imaging shows signs of aphasia, more tests may be needed. These tests measure how much the brain damage has affected the ability to talk, read, write, and understand. In most cases, the tests are done by a speech-language pathologist or speech therapist (a specialist who treats speech and communication disorders ). What are the treatments for aphasia? Some people fully recover from aphasia without treatment. But most people should begin speech-language therapy to treat aphasia as soon as possible. Treatment may be one-on-one with a speech therapist or in a group. Therapy using a computer may also be helpful. The specific therapy depends on the type of language loss that a person has. It may include exercises in reading, writing, following directions, and repeating what the therapist says. Therapy may also include learning how to communicate with gestures, pictures, smartphones, or other electronic devices. Family participation may be an important part of speech therapy. Family members can learn to help with recovery in many ways, such as: Using simpler language Including the person with aphasia in conversations Repeating or writing down key words to help communicate more clearly Language abilities may continue to improve over many years. In general, people recover their ability to understand language more fully than their ability to speak. How much a person recovers depends on many things, including: What caused the brain injury What part of the brain was hurt How badly and how much of the brain was hurt The age and health of the person Can aphasia be prevented? You can help prevent aphasia by: Making heart-healthy lifestyle changes to lower your chance of having: A stroke Heart disease Vascular disease (problems with your blood vessels) Protecting your brain from injury: Wearing the right helmet for sports safety , such as when riding a bike Taking action to prevent falls Always wearing your seatbelt and driving safely NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders",MedlinePlus
Aplastic Anemia,https://medlineplus.gov/aplasticanemia.html,"What is aplastic anemia? Aplastic anemia is a rare but serious blood disorder.

Arrhythmia,https://medlineplus.gov/arrhythmia.html,"What is an arrhythmia? An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. Your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern. Changes in the electrical signals that control your heartbeat cause arrhythmias. When your heart beats faster than normal, it's called tachycardia . When your heart beats too slowly, it's called bradycardia . When the signal to beat comes too early, it's called a premature or extra heartbeat . It may feel like your heart skipped a beat. There are many types of arrhythmias. Arrhythmias may affect the upper or lower chamber of your heart. The most common type of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation , which causes an irregular and fast heartbeat. Some arrhythmias are harmless, such as when your heart rate speeds up during exercise and slows down when you sleep. But if you have a frequent irregular rhythm, it may mean your heart isn't pumping enough blood into your body. Getting treatment and following a heart-healthy lifestyle can help control arrhythmias. It may also help prevent heart damage that can trigger some heart arrhythmias. What causes an arrhythmia? Many factors can affect your heart's rhythm, such as having had a heart attack , smoking , congenital heart defects , and stress. Other factors that could increase your risk for some types of arrhythmias could include if you: Have a family history of arrhythmias. Have certain health conditions, which can include heart and blood vessel diseases , lung diseases , kidney diseases , obesity , and sleep apnea . Are an older adult. Have had recent surgery for your heart, lungs, or throat. Take certain medicines for other health conditions. Use illegal drugs . If you have risk factors, some situations that make your heart work harder, raise your blood pressure, or cause strong emotional stress may trigger an arrhythmia. What are the symptoms of an arrhythmia? You may not have any noticeable symptoms of an arrhythmia. Your provider may find an arrhythmia during your routine checkup . Symptoms of an arrhythmia can include: Fast or slow heartbeat Skipping, fluttering, or pounding heartbeats Chest pain or discomfort Dizziness or fainting Shortness of breath Sweating Tiredness or weakness Seek emergency medical care if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, or think you are having a heart attack. How is an arrhythmia diagnosed? To find out if you have an arrhythmia, your health care provider may order an electrocardiogram (EKG). This test records your heart's electrical activity and is the most common for finding an arrhythmia. Your provider may also: Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms and lifestyle habits. Do a physical exam, which includes checking your heartbeat and pulse. Order blood tests and other heart tests . Check your legs or feet for swelling. Look for signs of other health conditions that could cause an arrythmia, such as thyroid disease . What are the treatments for an arrhythmia? Treatment may include medicines, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker , or sometimes surgery. Your provider may also recommend avoiding activities that may trigger your arrhythmia. The goal of treatment is to restore a normal heart rhythm. If not treated, arrhythmias can damage your heart, brain, and other organs and could be life-threatening. Can arrhythmias be prevented? To help prevent an arrhythmia, your provider may suggest that you make heart-healthy lifestyle changes and treat health conditions that may cause arrhythmias.

Arteriovenous Malformations,https://medlineplus.gov/arteriovenousmalformations.html,"What are arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)? Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are defects in your vascular system .  Your vascular system is your body's network of blood vessels. It includes your: Arteries, which carry oxygen-rich blood from your heart to your tissues and organs. Veins, which carry the blood and waste products back to your heart. Capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels that connect your small arteries to your small veins. An AVM is an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins. They are connected to each other, with no capillaries between them. Without the capillaries, the blood flow from the arteries goes directly into the veins at a faster rate than normal. Because of this, the nearby tissue does not get all the oxygen it would normally get. This lack of oxygen can lead to tissue damage and the death of nerve cells and other cells. The fast rate of blood flow can also increase the blood pressure inside the arteries and veins. This can weaken the arteries and veins. A weakened artery or blood vessel could burst or leak blood. What causes arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)? AVMs are rare. The cause of AVMs is unknown. Most of the time, people are born with them. But sometimes they can appear shortly after birth or later in life. What are the symptoms of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)? The symptoms of AVM will depend on where the AVM is located. They can happen anywhere in the body, but they are more common in the brain or spinal cord. Most people with brain or spinal cord AVMs have few, if any, major symptoms. But if a weakened blood vessel bursts, it can spill blood into the brain (called a hemorrhage). Severe hemorrhages can cause a stroke and brain damage. If an AVM is causing symptoms, they can include: Seizures Headache Pain in the area where the AVM is located Vision problems Muscle weakness Problems with movement and speech Confusion Dizziness Loss of consciousness How are arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) diagnosed? To find out if you have an AVM, your health care provider: Will ask about your symptoms and medical history. Will do a physical exam. This may include listening for a bruit. A bruit is whooshing sound caused by the rapid blood flow through the arteries and veins of an AVM. May order imaging tests , such as a CT scan , MRI , ultrasound , or cerebral angiography. For a cerebral angiography, you are injected with a special dye that helps the blood vessels in your brain show up on x-rays . What are the treatments for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)? Treatments for AVMs will depend on factors such as: Where the AVM is located Its size Your symptoms Your overall health Your risk of bleeding The treatment options may include: Monitoring for any signs that may mean you have an increased risk of hemorrhage. Medicines to help with the symptoms from AVMs. Surgery, which may be done if you have a higher-than-usual risk of bleeding. There are a few different types of surgery for AVMs. In some cases, you may have more than one type. Surgery can be risky, especially when it's done on the brain or spinal cord.

Sometimes they can be life-threatening. They are more common in people who have severe asthma. If you are having asthma attacks, you may need a change in your treatment. How is asthma diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma: Physical exam Medical history Lung function tests , including spirometry, to test how well your lungs work Tests to measure how your airways react to specific exposures. During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed. Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system. What are the treatments for asthma? If you have asthma, you will work with your health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. It will include: Strategies to avoid triggers. For example, if tobacco smoke is a trigger for you, you should not smoke or allow other people to smoke in your home or car. Short-term relief medicines, also called quick-relief medicines. They help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They include an inhaler to carry with you all the time. It may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your airways. Control medicines. You take them every day to help prevent symptoms. They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways. If you have a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, you will need emergency care. Your provider may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled. Sometimes asthma is severe and cannot be controlled with other treatments. If you are an adult with uncontrolled asthma, in some cases your provider might suggest bronchial thermoplasty. This is a procedure that uses heat to shrink the smooth muscle in the lungs. Shrinking the muscle reduces your airway's ability to tighten and allows you to breathe more easily. The procedure has some risks, so it's important to discuss them with your provider.",MedlinePlus

Asthma often starts during childhood, usually before age 5. Many children have asthma - it is the most common chronic disease of childhood. It can cause children to miss school and end up in the hospital. But treatments can help manage asthma. What causes asthma in children? The exact cause of asthma is unknown. Genetics and environment likely play a role in which children get asthma. An asthma attack can happen when your child is exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma: Allergic asthma is caused by allergens. Allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include Dust mites Mold Pets Pollen from grass, trees, and weeds Waste from pests such as cockroaches and mice Nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as Breathing in cold air Certain medicines Household chemicals Infections such as colds and the flu Outdoor air pollution Tobacco smoke Exercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dry Asthma triggers may be different for each child and can change over time. Which children are at risk for asthma? Certain factors raise the risk of asthma in children: Being exposed to secondhand smoke when their mother is pregnant with them or when they are small children Genetics and family history. Children are more likely to have asthma if one of their parents has it, especially if it's the mother. Race or ethnicity. Black and African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities. Having other diseases or conditions such as obesity and allergies Often having viral respiratory infections as young children Sex. In children, asthma is more common in boys. In teens, it is more common in girls. What are the symptoms of asthma in children? The symptoms of asthma in children include: Chest tightness Coughing, especially at night or early morning Breathing problems , such as shortness of breath, rapid breathing, or gasping for air Feeling tired Dark circles under the eyes Being irritable Wheezing, which causes a whistling sound when they breathe out Trouble eating or sucking (in infants) These symptoms can range from mild to severe. They may happen often or only once in a while. When children have an asthma attack, their symptoms get much worse. The attacks may come on gradually or suddenly. Sometimes they can be life-threatening. Warning signs of a severe attack include severe coughing, serious breathing problems, and turning very pale or blue in the face, lips and/or fingernails. If your child has those symptoms, get medical help right away. How is asthma in children diagnosed? It can be hard to diagnose asthma in children, especially if they are young. Asthma has similar symptoms as other childhood conditions. And some children may not have asthma symptoms very often, so it may seem like they are having respiratory infections instead. Your child's health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma: Physical exam Medical history Chest x-ray Lung function tests , including spirometry, to test how well the lungs work. Younger children are usually not able to do these tests. Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system. If you have a young child who cannot do lung function tests, the provider may suggest doing a trial of asthma medicines. The trial involves giving your child the medicines for several weeks to see whether the symptoms get better. What are the treatments for asthma in children? If your child has asthma, you will work with their health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your child's asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks, such as: Strategies to avoid triggers. For example, if tobacco smoke is a trigger for your child, you should not allow anyone to smoke in your home or car. Short-term relief medicines, also called quick-relief medicines. They help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They include an inhaler to have for your child at all times. It may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your child's airways. Control medicines. They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways. Not all children will take control medicines. Whether or not your child needs them depends on how severe the asthma is and how often your child has symptoms. If your child has a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, get medical help right away. Your child's provider may adjust the treatment until the asthma symptoms are controlled.",MedlinePlus
Ataxia Telangiectasia,https://medlineplus.gov/ataxiatelangiectasia.html,"Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare, inherited disease. It affects the nervous system, immune system, and other body systems.  Symptoms appear in young children, usually before age 5. They include: Ataxia - trouble coordinating movements Poor balance Slurred speech Tiny, red spider veins, called telangiectasias, on the skin and eyes Lung infections Delayed physical and sexual development People with A-T have an increased risk of developing diabetes and cancers, especially lymphoma and leukemia.

Atherosclerosis,https://medlineplus.gov/atherosclerosis.html,"What is atherosclerosis? Atherosclerosis is a condition in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Plaque is a sticky substance made up of cholesterol , fat, blood cells, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, plaque hardens and causes your arteries to narrow. That limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body. Some people may confuse atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis, but they are not the same thing: Arteriosclerosis is hardening of the arteries, which means that the arteries thicken and become less flexible. It can have several different causes. Atherosclerosis , which develops from plaque buildup, is a common type of arteriosclerosis. Atherosclerosis can affect most of the arteries in the body. It has different names, based on which arteries are affected: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is plaque buildup in the arteries of your heart. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is plaque buildup in the arteries that carry blood away from the heart to other parts of the body. It most often affects the arteries of your legs, but it can also affect the arteries of your arms or pelvis. Carotid artery disease is plaque buildup in the neck arteries. It reduces blood flow to the brain. Renal artery stenosis is plaque buildup in the arteries that supply blood to your kidneys. Vertebral artery disease is plaque buildup in the arteries that supply blood to the back of your brain. Mesenteric artery ischemia is plaque buildup in the arteries that supply your intestines with blood. What causes atherosclerosis? Plaque often starts to build up during childhood and gets worse with age. The exact cause is unknown, but researchers believe that this buildup happens when there is damage to the arteries. This damage may be caused by unhealthy lifestyle habits, medical conditions, and your genes. Who is more likely to develop atherosclerosis? You may be more likely to develop atherosclerosis if you: Have certain medical conditions, including: High blood pressure High blood cholesterol Diabetes Metabolic syndrome Inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis Have a family history of high blood cholesterol Eat a lot of foods high in saturated fats Smoke or chew tobacco Are older - the risk increases after age 45 men and age 55 in women What are the symptoms of atherosclerosis? In the early stages, atherosclerosis often does not cause any symptoms. You may first notice some symptoms at times when your body needs more oxygen. For example, this could be when you are having physical or emotional stress. Your symptoms will depend on which arteries are affected and how much blood flow is blocked: With coronary artery disease , the symptoms may include angina (a type of chest pain), palpitations (racing or pounding heart), and shortness of breath . With carotid artery disease , you may have a bruit. This is a whooshing sound that your health care provider hears when using a stethoscope. You could also have a transient ischemic attack (TIA), sometimes called a mini-stroke. With peripheral artery disease , you may have pain, aching, heaviness, or cramping in the legs when walking or climbing stairs. With vertebral artery disease , you may have problems with thinking and memory, weakness or numbness on one side of the body or face, and vision trouble. You could also have a transient ischemic attack. With mesenteric artery ischemia , the symptoms can include severe pain after meals, weight loss, and diarrhea . For men, erectile dysfunction (ED) is an early warning sign that you may be at higher risk for atherosclerosis and its complications. If you have ED, talk with your provider about your risk of plaque buildup. What other problems can atherosclerosis cause? Atherosclerosis can cause other health problems, or complications. For example, if a plaque bursts, a blood clot may form. The clot could block the artery completely or travel to another part of the body. Other possible complications can vary, depending on which arteries are affected. For example, blockages in different parts of the body can lead to complications such as a heart attack , stroke , vascular dementia , or limb loss . How is atherosclerosis diagnosed? To find out if you have atherosclerosis, your provider: Will ask about your medical and family health history Will ask about your lifestyle and risk factors for plaque buildup in the arteries Will do a physical exam, which will include listening to your heart and the blood flow in your arteries Will likely order tests, such as blood tests and heart health tests What are the treatments for atherosclerosis? If you have atherosclerosis, your provider will work with you to create a treatment plan that works for you. Your plan will depend on which arteries are affected, how much the blood flow is blocked, and what other medical conditions you have. Possible treatments may include: Heart-healthy lifestyle changes . Medicines to: Manage your risk factors. Treat atherosclerosis or its complications. Treat any medical conditions you have that can worsen plaque buildup. Procedures or surgeries to treat diseases or complications that were caused by plaque buildup. The specific type of procedure or surgery will depend on which arteries are affected. Cardiac rehabilitation , if you have had certain complications from atherosclerosis. Can atherosclerosis be prevented? There are steps you can take to try to prevent atherosclerosis: Choose heart-healthy foods , such fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit foods that are high in saturated fats, salt , and added sugars. Do regular physical activity . But before you start an exercise program, ask your provider what level of physical activity is right for you. Aim for a healthy weight . Limit how much alcohol you drink. Drinking less is better for health than drinking more. Men should limit their intake to 2 drinks or less in a day. Women should drink 1 drink or less per day. Manage stress . If you smoke, quit smoking . Avoid secondhand smoke . Get enough good-quality sleep . NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus

Atrial Fibrillation,https://medlineplus.gov/atrialfibrillation.html,"What is atrial fibrillation (AFib)? Atrial fibrillation, also known as AFib or AF, is one of the most common types of arrhythmias .  Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. They can cause your heart to beat too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way. If you have AFib, your heart beats irregularly and sometimes much faster than normal. Also, your heart's upper and lower chambers do not work together as they should. When this happens, the lower chambers do not fill completely or pump enough blood to your lungs and body. This can cause symptoms such as dizziness , fatigue , and a pounding heartbeat. AFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition. It's very important to treat it, since AFib can put you at risk for stroke and other heart conditions . What causes atrial fibrillation (AFib)? AFib is most often caused by changes to the heart's tissue or the electrical signaling that helps the heartbeat. These changes can happen due to different conditions and factors, such as high blood pressure , coronary artery disease , congenital heart defects , infections, and aging. Sometimes the cause is unknown. Who is more likely to develop atrial fibrillation (AFib)? Anyone can develop AFib, but there are certain things that raise your risk for it: Aging. The risk of atrial fibrillation increases as you get older, especially when you are over age 65. Family history and genetics. AFib can run in families. So can heart disease, which raises your risk of AFib. Some lifestyle choices. Your risk is higher if you drink a lot of alcohol, use certain illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamines, or smoke. Having certain health conditions, such as: High blood pressure Diabetes Heart failure Heart valve diseases Obesity Hyperthyroidism Chronic kidney disease COPD and other lung diseases Sleep apnea Race. AFib is more common in people with European ancestry. Recent surgery. You may be at risk of atrial fibrillation in the early days and weeks after surgery on your heart , lungs, or esophagus. What are the symptoms of atrial fibrillation (AFib)? Some people who have AFib don't have any symptoms and don't know they have it. If you do have symptoms, you may only notice them once in a while. Or you may have symptoms that are more frequent. And in some cases, the symptoms might be severe. If you have heart disease, you are more likely to notice your symptoms. And those symptoms could get worse if your heart disease gets worse. The symptoms of AFib can include: Extreme fatigue, which is the most common symptom Heart palpitations (the feeling that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, pounding, or beating too hard or too fast) Trouble breathing , especially when lying down or when exercising Chest pain Dizziness or fainting Low blood pressure What other problems can AFib cause? If AFib is not treated, it can lead to serious health problems (complications) such as: Stroke Heart failure Blood clots Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) Cognitive impairment and dementia To help prevent these problems, it's important to contact your health care provider if you are having symptoms. If you do have AFib, the sooner you are diagnosed and treated, the better. How is atrial fibrillation (AFib) diagnosed? To find out if you have AFib, your provider: Will ask about your medical history, including your symptoms, lifestyle, and any other health conditions you may have Will ask about your family history, to find out if you have relatives who have or had AFib Will do a physical exam May order blood tests Will likely order heart tests , such as an electrocardiogram (also called an EKG or ECG) and echocardiogram May ask you to wear a heart monitor device that records your heart's electrical activity What are the treatments for atrial fibrillation (AFib)? The treatments for AFib may include: Blood thinner medicines that help prevent blood clots from forming. Medicines to control your heart's rhythm and rate. Following heart-healthy lifestyle changes , such as: Following a heart-healthy eating plan that limits saturated fats , salt , and cholesterol . An example is the DASH eating plan . Limiting or avoiding alcohol , because it can increase your heart rate. Aiming for a healthy weight . Getting regular physical activity . Managing stress . Quitting smoking . Procedures such as: Electrical cardioversion, which restores your heart rhythm using low-energy shocks to your heart. Catheter ablation, which scars the tissue that is causing the arrhythmia. The scar tissue blocks the abnormal heart signals. Surgeries such as: Surgery to put in a pacemaker to help control the arrhythmia. A Maze procedure, which creates scar tissue in a maze-like pattern in certain parts of the heart. Left atrial appendage closure, a surgery on a small sac in the muscle wall of your left atrium (the upper left chamber of your heart). It helps prevent blood clots and can reduce your risk of stroke. This surgery is for people who are not able to take blood thinners. Can atrial fibrillation (AFib) be prevented? There are steps you can take to help lower your risk of atrial fibrillation, such as: Making heart-healthy lifestyle changes: Following a heart-healthy eating plan Limiting or avoiding alcohol Aiming for a healthy weight Getting regular physical activity Managing stress Not smoking Avoiding illegal drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamines Taking antiarrhythmic medicine (medicine to treat arrhythmia) if you are having heart surgery Treating any health conditions that could raise your risk of AFib NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,https://medlineplus.gov/attentiondeficithyperactivitydisorder.html,"What is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)? ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder. It is usually first diagnosed in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. But some people don't get diagnosed with ADHD until they are adults. ADHD involves: Having trouble paying attention (inattention) Having trouble controlling impulsive behaviors (impulsivity) Being overly active (hyperactivity) What are the types of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)? There are three types of ADHD: Mostly Inattentive ADHD. People with this type of ADHD have trouble paying attention and are easily distracted. It's hard for them to organize or finish tasks. They may have trouble following instructions or conversations. Mostly Hyperactive-Impulsive ADHD. People with this type of ADHD have symptoms of both hyperactivity and impulsivity: With hyperactivity, people feel a need to always be moving. They have trouble sitting still and may fidget and/or talk too much. With impulsivity, people have trouble controlling their actions and words. They tend to act on sudden ideas or feelings without thinking about the possible results. They may interrupt others a lot or have trouble waiting their turn. Combined ADHD. People with this type of ADHD have a mix of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Combined ADHD is the most common type. It's normal to sometimes have trouble paying attention or sitting still, especially for children. But people with ADHD have more severe symptoms that can sometimes cause serious problems, for example, failing grades for a child or a job loss for an adult. The symptoms are ongoing and may affect family and social life, too. What causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)? The exact cause of ADHD is unknown. ADHD probably results from a combination of factors, such as genetics and your environment. Researchers are looking at possible environmental factors that might raise the risk of developing ADHD. These factors include brain injuries, nutrition, and social environments. What are the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)? The symptoms of ADHD depend on the type of ADHD a person has: People with symptoms of attention problems may often: Miss details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or in other activities Have trouble staying focused on play activities or work tasks Not seem to listen when spoken to directly Find it hard to follow instructions or finish tasks, or may start but get easily sidetracked Have trouble being organized, keeping belongings in order, and managing time Avoid doing tasks that require long periods of mental effort Lose important items, such as books, wallets, keys, eyeglasses, and cellphones Forget about doing daily activities People with symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity may often: Fidget and squirm while seated Get up when staying seated is expected, such as at school or work Run around or climb when it's not appropriate (children) or feel restless (teens and adults) Have trouble doing quiet activities Be constantly moving or ""on the go"" Talk much more than is normal Blurt out answers before questions are completed Have trouble waiting for their turn Interrupt others for example during conversations or games People with combined ADHD show a mix of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms How is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosed? There is no single test to diagnose ADHD. One step of the process for diagnosing ADHD involves having a physical exam, including vision tests , hearing tests (for children and adults ), and other tests to rule out other problems with symptoms like ADHD. Other problems with similar symptoms include anxiety , depression , sleep problems , and certain types of learning disabilities . The process also involves a thorough medical history and family history.  And it usually includes using standardized ADHD symptom checklists, questionnaires, and/or interview questions. These tools have rating scales (scoring systems) that help the provider see if a person's symptoms and history fit a diagnosis of ADHD. To make a diagnosis of ADHD, the provider needs to have found all of these things: Several symptoms of ADHD that began before age 12. Several symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that have lasted for at least 6 months and cause serious problems: For children up to age 16, there must be at least 6 ongoing symptoms. For people 17 and older, there must be at least 5 ongoing symptoms. Symptoms that happen in 2 or more settings, for example, at home and at work or school. Symptoms that clearly get in the way of functioning well at school, work, and/or in social situations. Symptoms aren't caused by another mental health disorder . What are the treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)? Although there is no cure for ADHD, treatments may help reduce symptoms and improve functioning. ADHD is commonly treated with: Medicines. Psychotherapy (talk therapy), including behavior therapy. Education or training for parents to give them the skills and strategies to help their child. This is especially important for younger children. A combination of these treatments. Good treatment plans will include close monitoring, follow-ups, and making changes, if needed, along the way. Having a healthy lifestyle, such as healthy eating and regular exercise , may also help manage symptoms. For school-aged children, school support is important. This could include classroom-based behavioral interventions such as behavior management plans or teaching your child organizational and study skills. It may also include accommodations such as specific seating in the classroom, reduced classwork, or extended time on tests and exams. NIH: National Institute of Mental Health",MedlinePlus

Autoimmune Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/autoimmunediseases.html,"What are autoimmune diseases? Your immune system protects you from disease and infection by attacking germs that get into your body, such as viruses and bacteria. Your immune system can tell that the germs aren't part of you, so it destroys them. If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks the healthy cells of your organs and tissues by mistake. There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases. They can affect almost any part of your body. For example, alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease of the skin that causes hair loss. Autoimmune hepatitis affects the liver. In type 1 diabetes , the immune system attacks the pancreas.  And in rheumatoid arthritis , the immune system can attack many parts of the body, including the joints, lungs, and eyes. What causes autoimmune diseases? No one is sure why autoimmune diseases happen. But you can't catch them from other people. Autoimmune diseases do tend to run in families, which means that certain genes may make some people more likely to develop a problem. Viruses, certain chemicals, and other things in the environment may trigger an autoimmune disease if you already have the genes for it. Who is at risk for autoimmune diseases? Millions of Americans of all ages have autoimmune diseases. Women develop many types of autoimmune diseases much more often than men. And if you have one autoimmune disease, you are more likely to get another. What are the symptoms of autoimmune diseases? The symptoms of an autoimmune disease depend on the part of your body that's affected. Many types of autoimmune diseases cause redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are the signs and symptoms of inflammation.  But other illnesses can cause the same symptoms. The symptoms of autoimmune diseases can come and go. During a flare-up, your symptoms may get severe for a while. Later on, you may have a remission, which means that your symptoms get better or disappear for a period of time. How are autoimmune diseases diagnosed? Doctors often have a hard time diagnosing autoimmune diseases. There's usually not a specific test to show whether you have a certain autoimmune disease. And the symptoms can be confusing. That's because many autoimmune diseases have similar symptoms. And some symptoms, such as muscle aches, are common in many other illnesses. So it can take a long time and some visits to different types of doctors to get a diagnosis. To help your doctor find out if an autoimmune disease is causing your symptoms,: Learn about the health conditions in your family history .  What health problems did your grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins have? Write down what you learn and share it with your doctor. Keep track of your symptoms, including how long they last and what makes them better or worse. Share your notes with your doctor. See a specialist who deals with the symptoms that bother you most. For example, if you have rash, see a dermatologist (skin doctor). What are the treatments for autoimmune diseases? The treatment depends on the disease. In most cases, the goal of treatment is to suppress (slow down) your immune system, and ease swelling, redness, and pain from inflammation. Your doctor may give you corticosteroids or other medicines to help you feel better. For some diseases, you may need treatment for the rest of your life.",MedlinePlus

Under a microscope, they look like balls, rods, or spirals. They can be found almost everywhere on Earth. There are lots of bacteria in and on your body. In fact, your body has about 10 times more bacteria cells than human cells. There are many different types of bacteria. Most types don't make you sick. Some types are helpful. For example, ""good"" bacteria in your digestive system can help your body digest food and absorb vitamins and minerals . They can help protect you from getting sick. Bacteria are also used in making foods like yogurt and cheese. But some types of bacteria can cause an infection and make you sick. They are called infectious bacteria. These bacteria can reproduce quickly in your body. Many of them give off toxins (poisons) that can damage your cells and make you sick. Other types can move into and damage your tissues. A few examples of bacteria that cause infections include Streptococcus , Staphylococcus , and E. coli . How do bacterial infections spread? There are different ways that bacterial infections may spread: Through droplets and particles that are breathed out by someone who has the infection. You might breathe in the droplets or particles, or they could land on your mouth, nose, or eyes. By touching surfaces or objects that have the bacteria on them and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes. Through cuts, scrapes, and skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the infection. From the pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy . Through contaminated food or water . By being bitten by an infected insect or animal . Through sexual contact (usually vaginal, anal and oral sex) with someone who has the infection. What are the treatments for bacterial infections? Sometimes your immune system may be able to fight off a bacterial infection. But when you do need treatment, it will be with antibiotics . When you take antibiotics, follow the directions carefully. Each time you take them, there is a risk that the bacteria will become resistant to the effects of the antibiotics. This is called antibiotic resistance . When this happens, the bacteria are not killed, and they continue to grow. They can cause resistant infections, which can be difficult, and sometimes impossible, to treat. Can bacterial infections be prevented? You can help prevent some bacterial infections by: Getting vaccines that protect against bacterial infections. Having good hygiene habits . These include washing your hands often and covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. Paying attention to food safety . Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that your frequently touch.

Vascular birthmarks are made up of blood vessels that haven't formed correctly. They are usually red. Two types of vascular birthmarks are hemangiomas and port-wine stains. Pigmented birthmarks are made of a cluster of pigment cells which cause color in skin. They can be many different colors, from tan to brown, gray to black, or even blue. Moles can be birthmarks. No one knows what causes many types of birthmarks, but some run in families. Your baby's doctor will look at the birthmark to see if it needs any treatment or if it should be watched. Pigmented birthmarks aren't usually treated, except for moles. Treatment for vascular birthmarks includes laser surgery. Most birthmarks are not serious, and some go away on their own. Some stay the same or get worse as you get older. Usually birthmarks are only a concern for your appearance. But certain types can increase your risk of skin cancer. If your birthmark bleeds, hurts, itches, or becomes infected, call your health care provider.",MedlinePlus

Bleeding,https://medlineplus.gov/bleeding.html,"Bleeding is the loss of blood . It can be external, or outside the body, like when you get a cut or wound . It can also be internal, or inside the body, like when you have an injury to an internal organ.  Some bleeding, such as gastrointestinal bleeding , coughing up blood, or vaginal bleeding , can be a symptom of a disease. Normally, when you are injured and start bleeding, a blood clot forms to stop the bleeding quickly. Afterwards, the clot dissolves naturally. To be able to make a clot, your blood needs blood proteins called clotting factors and a type of blood cell called platelets . Some people have a problem with clotting, due to another medical condition or an inherited disease. There are two types of problems: Your blood may not form clots normally, known as a bleeding disorder . This happens when your body does not make enough platelets or clotting factors, or they don't work the way they should. Your blood may make too many clots, or the clots may not dissolve properly Sometimes bleeding can cause other problems. A bruise is bleeding under the skin.

Blisters,https://medlineplus.gov/blisters.html,"What are blisters? Blisters are fluid-filled sacs on the outer layer of your skin. They form because of rubbing, heat, or diseases of the skin. They are most common on your hands and feet. Other names for blisters are vesicles (usually for smaller blisters) and bulla (for larger blisters). What causes blisters? Blisters often happen when there is friction - rubbing or pressure - on one spot. For example, if your shoes don't fit quite right and they keep rubbing part of your foot. Or if you don't wear gloves when you rake leaves and the handle keeps rubbing against your hand. Other causes of blisters include: Burns Sunburn Frostbite Eczema Allergic reactions Poison ivy, oak, and sumac Autoimmune diseases such as pemphigus Epidermolysis bullosa, an illness that causes the skin to be fragile Viral infections such as varicella zoster (which causes chickenpox and shingles ) and herpes simplex (which causes cold sores ) Skin infections including impetigo What are the treatments for blisters? Blisters will usually heal on their own. The skin over the blister helps keep out infections. You can put a bandage on the blister to keep it clean.  Make sure that there is no more rubbing or friction on the blister. You should contact your health care provider if: The blister looks infected - if it is draining pus, or the area around the blister is red, swollen, warm, or very painful You have a fever You have several blisters, especially if you cannot figure out what is causing them You have health problems such as circulation problems or diabetes Normally you don't want to drain a blister, because of the risk of infection. But if a blister is large, painful, or looks like it will pop on its own, you can drain the fluid. Can blisters be prevented? There are some things you can do to prevent friction blisters: Make sure that your shoes fit properly Always wear socks with your shoes, and make sure that the socks fit well. You may want to wear socks that are acrylic or nylon, so they keep moisture away from your feet. Wear gloves or protective gear on your hands when you use any tools or sports equipment that cause friction.",MedlinePlus
Blood,https://medlineplus.gov/blood.html,"Your blood is made up of liquid and solids. The liquid part, called plasma, is made of water, salts, and protein. Over half of your blood is plasma. The solid part of your blood contains red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Red blood cells (RBC) deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs. White blood cells (WBC) fight infection and are part of your immune system. Platelets help blood to clot when you have a cut or wound. Bone marrow, the spongy material inside your bones, makes new blood cells. Blood cells constantly die and your body makes new ones. Red blood cells live about 120 days, and platelets live about 6 days. Some white blood cells live less than a day, but others live much longer. There are four blood types: A, B, AB, or O. Also, blood is either Rh-positive or Rh-negative. So if you have type A blood, it's either A positive or A negative. Which type you are is important if you need a blood transfusion . And your Rh factor could be important if you become pregnant - an incompatibility between your type and the baby's could create problems. Blood tests such as blood count tests help doctors check for certain diseases and conditions. They also help check the function of your organs and show how well treatments are working.

Blood Clots,https://medlineplus.gov/bloodclots.html,"What is a blood clot? A blood clot is a mass of blood that forms when platelets , proteins, and cells in the blood stick together. When you get hurt, your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding .  After the bleeding stops and healing takes place, your body usually breaks down and removes the blood clot. But sometimes the blood clots form where they shouldn't, your body makes too many blood clots or abnormal blood clots, or the blood clots don't break down like they should. These blood clots can be dangerous and may cause other health problems. Blood clots can form in, or travel to, the blood vessels in the limbs, lungs, brain, heart, and kidneys. The types of problems blood clots can cause will depend on where they are: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the lower leg, thigh, or pelvis. It can block a vein and cause damage to your leg. A pulmonary embolism (PE) can happen when a DVT breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. A PE, especially if it is large, can damage your lungs and prevent your other organs from getting enough oxygen. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare blood clot in the venous sinuses in your brain. Normally the venous sinuses drain blood from your brain. CVST blocks the blood from draining and can cause a hemorrhagic stroke . Blood clots in other parts of the body can cause problems such as an ischemic stroke , a heart attack , kidney problems , kidney failure , and pregnancy-related problems . Who is more likely to develop blood clots? Certain factors can raise your risk of developing blood clots: Atherosclerosis Atrial fibrillation Being overweight or having obesity Cancer and cancer treatments Certain genetic disorders Certain surgeries COVID-19 Diabetes Family history of blood clots Overweight and obesity Pregnancy and giving birth Serious injuries Some medicines, including birth control pills Smoking Staying in one position for a long time, such as being in the hospital or taking a long car or plane ride What are the symptoms of blood clots? The symptoms for blood clots can be different, depending on where the blood clot is: In the abdomen: Abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting In an arm or leg: Sudden or gradual pain, swelling, tenderness, and warmth In the lungs: Shortness of breath, pain with deep breathing, rapid breathing, and increased heart rate In the brain: Trouble speaking , vision problems , seizures , weakness on one side of the body, and sudden severe headache In the heart: Chest pain , sweating, shortness of breath, and pain in the left arm How are blood clots diagnosed? To find out if you have one or more blood clots, your health care provider: Will do a physical exam. Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. May order blood tests, including a D-dimer test . May order imaging tests , such as Ultrasound . X-rays of the veins (venography) or blood vessels (angiography) that are taken after you get an injection of special dye. The dye shows up on the x-ray and allows the provider to see how the blood flows. CT Scan . What are the treatments for blood clots? Treatments for blood clots depend on where the blood clot is located and how severe it is. Treatments may include: Blood thinners . Other medicines, including thrombolytics. Thrombolytics are medicines that dissolve blood clots. They are usually used where the blood clots are severe. Surgery and other procedures to remove the blood clots Can blood clots be prevented? You may be able to help prevent blood clots by: Moving around as soon as possible after having been confined to your bed, such as after surgery, illness, or injury Getting up and moving around every few hours when you have to sit for long periods of time, for example if you are on a long flight or car trip Wearing compression stockings after surgery or during a long flight Regular physical activity Not smoking Staying at a healthy weight Some people at high risk may need to take blood thinners to prevent blood clots.",MedlinePlus

Blood Glucose,https://medlineplus.gov/bloodglucose.html,"What is blood glucose? Blood glucose, or blood sugar, is the main sugar found in your blood. It is your body's primary source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy. What is diabetes? Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose levels are too high. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious health problems (diabetes complications). So if you have diabetes, it's important to keep your blood glucose levels within your target range. What are blood glucose targets? If you have diabetes, your blood glucose target is the range you try to reach as much as possible. The typical targets are: Before a meal: 80 to 130 mg/dL Two hours after the start of a meal: Less than 180 mg/dL Your blood glucose targets may be different, depending on your age, any additional health problems you have, and other factors. Talk with your health care team  about the best target range for you. When and how should I check my blood glucose? If you have diabetes, you'll likely need to check your blood glucose every day to make sure that your blood glucose numbers are in your target range. Some people may need to check their blood glucose several times a day. Ask your health care team how often you need to check it. The most common way to check your blood glucose level at home is with a blood glucose meter. A blood glucose meter measures the amount of glucose in a small sample of blood, usually from your fingertip. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is another way to check your glucose levels. Most CGM systems use a tiny sensor that is inserted under your skin. The sensor measures your glucose level every few minutes. It can show changes in your glucose level throughout the day and night. A CGM system is especially useful for people who take insulin and have problems with low blood glucose. Your provider will also check your blood glucose with a blood test called an A1C .  It checks your average blood glucose level over the past three months. People with diabetes usually have an A1C test at least twice a year. But you may need the test more often if you aren't meeting your diabetes treatment goals. What happens if my blood glucose level becomes too high? High blood glucose is called hyperglycemia . Symptoms that your blood glucose levels may be too high include: Feeling thirsty Feeling tired or weak Headaches Urinating (peeing) often Blurred vision If you often have high blood glucose levels or symptoms of high blood glucose, talk with your health care team. You may need a change in your diabetes meal plan , physical activity plan, or diabetes medicines . High blood glucose may also be caused by other conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood. These conditions include problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands . What happens if my blood glucose level becomes low for me? Hypoglycemia , also called low blood glucose, happens when your blood glucose level drops below what is healthy for you. For many people with diabetes, this means a blood glucose reading lower than 70 mg/dL. Your number might be different, so check with your health care team to find out what blood glucose level is low for you. Symptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly. The symptoms can be different for everyone, but they may include: Shaking Sweating Nervousness or anxiety Irritability or confusion Dizziness Hunger Low blood glucose levels can be common in people with type 1 diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes who take certain diabetes medicines. If you think you may have low blood glucose, check your level, even if you don't have symptoms. Low blood glucose can be dangerous and should be treated as soon as possible. Although it's rare, you can still get low blood glucose without having diabetes. The causes can include conditions such as liver disease , kidney disease , and hormone deficiencies (lack of certain hormones). Some medicines, such as certain heart medicines and antibiotics , can also cause it. See your provider to find out the cause of your low blood glucose and how to treat it.

Blood Pressure Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/bloodpressuremedicines.html,"What is high blood pressure? High blood pressure , also called hypertension, is when blood puts too much pressure against the walls of your arteries. Almost half of American adults have high blood pressure, usually with no symptoms. But it can cause serious problems such as stroke , heart failure , heart attack , and kidney disease . What lifestyle changes can help lower high blood pressure? Healthy lifestyle changes can help reduce high blood pressure: Losing weight Being physically active Managing stress Reducing sodium in your diet Avoiding alcohol , tobacco , and illegal drugs Getting enough sleep What if lifestyle changes alone cannot lower blood pressure? Sometimes lifestyle changes alone cannot control or lower your high blood pressure. In that case, your health care provider may prescribe blood pressure medicines. How do blood pressure medicines work? The most commonly used blood pressure medicines work in different ways to lower blood pressure: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) keep your blood vessels from narrowing as much and allows blood to move through them with less pressure. Beta blockers help your heart beat slower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also have certain other conditions. Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax. Diuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount of fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill. Often, two or more medicines work better than one. If these medicines do not lower your blood pressure enough, your provider may suggest that you take another type of blood pressure medicine. While taking the medicines, it is still important to keep up with your healthy lifestyle changes. Doing both helps keep blood pressure lower than lifestyle changes or medicines alone.

Blood Thinners,https://medlineplus.gov/bloodthinners.html,"What are blood thinners? Blood thinners are medicines that prevent blood clots from forming. They do not break up clots that you already have. But they can stop those clots from getting bigger. It's important to treat blood clots, because clots in your blood vessels and heart can cause heart attacks , strokes , and blockages. Who needs blood thinners? You may need a blood thinner if you have: Certain heart or blood vessel diseases An abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation A heart valve replacement A risk of blood clots after surgery Congenital heart defects What are the different types of blood thinners? There are different types of blood thinners: Anticoagulants, such as heparin or warfarin (also called Coumadin), slow down your body's process of making clots. Antiplatelets, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, prevent blood cells called platelets from clumping together to form a clot. Antiplatelets are mainly taken by people who have had a heart attack or stroke. How can I take blood thinners safely? When you take a blood thinner, follow the directions carefully. Blood thinners may interact with certain foods, medicines, vitamins, and alcohol. Make sure that your health care provider knows all of the medicines and supplements you are using. You may need regular blood tests to check how well your blood is clotting. It is important to make sure that you're taking enough medicine to prevent clots, but not so much that it causes bleeding. What are the side effects of blood thinners? Bleeding is the most common side effect of blood thinners. They can also cause an upset stomach, nausea , and diarrhea . Other possible side effects can depend on which type of blood thinner that you are taking. Call your provider if you have any sign of serious bleeding, such as: Menstrual bleeding that is much heavier than normal Red or brown urine Bowel movements that are red or black Bleeding from the gums or nose that does not stop quickly Vomit that is brown or bright red Coughing up something red Severe pain, such as a headache or stomachache Unusual bruising A cut that does not stop bleeding A serious fall or bump on the head Dizziness or weakness",MedlinePlus
Blood Transfusion and Donation,https://medlineplus.gov/bloodtransfusionanddonation.html,"Every year, millions of people in the United States receive life-saving blood transfusions.  During a transfusion, you receive whole blood or parts of blood such as: Red blood cells - cells that carry oxygen to and from tissues and organs Platelets - cells that form clots to control bleeding Plasma - the liquid part of the blood that helps clotting. You may need it if you have been badly burned, have liver failure or a severe infection. Most blood transfusions go very smoothly.  Some infectious agents, such as HIV, can survive in blood and infect the person receiving the blood transfusion. To keep blood safe, blood banks carefully screen donated blood. The risk of catching a virus from a blood transfusion is low. Sometimes it is possible to have a transfusion of your own blood. During surgery, you may need a blood transfusion because of blood loss. If you are having a surgery that you're able to schedule months in advance, your doctor may ask whether you would like to use your own blood, instead of donated blood. If so, you will need to have blood drawn one or more times before the surgery. A blood bank will store your blood for your use. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Body Lice,https://medlineplus.gov/bodylice.html,"What are body lice? Body lice (also called clothes lice) are tiny insects which live and lay nits (lice eggs) on clothing. They are parasites, and they need to feed on human blood to survive. They usually only move to the skin to feed. Body lice are one of the three types of lice that live on humans. The other two types are head lice and pubic lice . Each type of lice is different, and getting one type does not mean that you will get another type. Body lice can spread diseases, such as typhus, trench fever, and relapsing fever. How do body lice spread? Body lice move by crawling, because they cannot hop or fly. One way that they spread is through physical contact with a person who has body lice. They can also spread through contact with clothing, beds, bed linens, or towels that were used by a person with body lice. You cannot get lice from animals. Who is at risk for body lice? Body lice is most common in people who cannot bathe and wash their clothes regularly, especially if they live in crowded conditions. In the United States, this is most often people experiencing homelessness . In other countries, body lice can also affect refugees and victims of war or natural disasters. What are the symptoms of body lice? The most common symptom of body lice is intense itching . There may also be a rash, which is caused by an allergic reaction to the bites. The itching causes some people to scratch until they get sores. Sometimes these sores can become infected with bacteria or fungi . If someone has body lice for a long time, the heavily bitten areas of their skin can become thickened and discolored. This is most common around your midsection (waist, groin, and upper thighs). How do you know if you have body lice? A diagnosis of body lice usually comes from finding nits and crawling lice in the seams of clothing. Sometimes a body louse can be seen crawling or feeding on the skin. Other times it takes a magnifying lens to see the lice or nits. What are the treatments for body lice? The main treatment for body lice is to improve personal hygiene. That means regular showers and washing clothes, bedding, and towels at least once a week. Use hot water to wash the laundry, and dry it using the hot cycle of the dryer. Some people may also need a lice-killing medicine. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus

Bone Density,https://medlineplus.gov/bonedensity.html,"What is bone density? Your bones are made of living tissue. To keep them strong, your body breaks down old bone and replaces it with new bone. But when more bone is broken down than replaced, you lose bone density, also called bone mass. Bone density is a measure of the amount of calcium and other minerals in bone. Bones containing more minerals are denser. They tend to be stronger and less likely to fracture (break). Losing bone density can weaken your bones. In some cases, it can lead to osteoporosis . This is a disease which can make your bones more likely to break. Low bone density that is not low enough to be osteoporosis is sometimes called osteopenia. What can make you lose bone density? Your bones become less dense as you age. Other factors can also make you more likely to lose bone mass, such as: A family history of osteoporosis or low bone mass Not developing good bone mass when you are young Having certain medical conditions, such as: Endocrine diseases Certain digestive diseases Rheumatoid arthritis Certain types of cancer HIV Anorexia nervosa, a type of eating disorder Taking certain medicines, such as: Corticosteroids Proton pump inhibitors (which treat GERD ) Medicines to treat epilepsy Smoking tobacco Long-term heavy alcohol use Physical inactivity or prolonged periods of bedrest Not everyone who has low bone mass gets osteoporosis, but they are at higher risk for developing it. Is there a test to measure your bone health? A bone density scan is the best way to measure your bone health. It compares your bone density, or mass, to that of a healthy person who is the same age and sex as you are. It can show: Whether you have low bone density Whether you have osteoporosis, a disease that makes your bones weak Your risk for breaking bones Whether your osteoporosis treatment is working How can I keep my bones strong? To help keep your bones strong and help prevent osteoporosis, the best thing to do is to eat a healthy diet rich in calcium and vitamin D .

Botulism,https://medlineplus.gov/botulism.html,"Botulism is a rare but serious illness. The cause is a toxin (poison) made by a bacterium called Clostridium botulinum. It occurs naturally in soil. There are several kinds of botulism. Foodborne botulism comes from eating foods contaminated with the toxin. Wound botulism happens when a wound infected with the bacteria makes the toxin. It is more common in heroin users. Infant botulism happens when a baby consumes the spores of the bacteria from soil or honey.  All forms can be deadly and are medical emergencies. Symptoms include double or blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. Treatment may include antitoxins, intensive medical care, or surgery of infected wounds.

Brain Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/braindiseases.html,"Your brain is the control center of your body. It controls your thoughts, memory, speech, and movement. It regulates the function of many organs. It's part of your nervous system, which also includes your spinal cord and peripheral nerves. The nervous system sends signals between your brain and the rest of the body. Your nerves take in information from your senses and send it to the brain to be processed. Your brain and nerves also communicate to help you move and to control your body's functions. When the brain is healthy, it works quickly and automatically. But when you have a brain disease, it may affect how  well you can function and do your daily activities. Some common brain diseases include: Brain tumors , which can press on nerves and affect brain function. Degenerative nerve diseases , which can affect many of your body's activities, such as balance , movement , talking , breathing , and heart function. Types include Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease . Encephalitis (inflammation in the brain), which can lead to problems such as vision loss , weakness, and paralysis . Genetic brain disorders , which are caused by changes in genes (also called variants or mutations). These disorders can affect the development and function of the brain. Strokes , which can cause a loss of brain cells and can affect your ability to think clearly. Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), which can affect brain function. They may range from mild to severe. The effects of a TBI may be temporary or permanent. The symptoms of brain diseases vary widely, depending on the specific problem. In some cases, damage is permanent.

Breast Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/breastcancer.html,"What is breast cancer? Breast cancer is a cancer that starts in breast tissue.  It happens when cells in the breast change and grow out of control. The cells usually form a tumor. Sometimes the cancer does not spread any further. This is called ""in situ."" If the cancer spreads outside the breast, the cancer is called ""invasive."" It may just spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes. Or the cancer may metastasize (spread to other parts of the body) through the lymph system or the blood. Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women in the United States. Rarely, it can also affect men . What are the types of breast cancer? There are different types of breast cancer. The types are based on which breast cells turn into cancer. The types include: Ductal carcinoma , which begins in the cells of the ducts. This is the most common type. Lobular carcinoma , which begins in the lobules. It is more often found in both breasts than other types of breast cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer , in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. The breast becomes warm, red, and swollen. This is a rare type. Paget's disease of the breast , which is a cancer involving the skin of the nipple. It usually also affects the darker skin around the nipple. It is also rare. What causes breast cancer? Breast cancer happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA). Often, the exact cause of these genetic changes is unknown. But sometimes these genetic changes are inherited, meaning that you are born with them. Breast cancer that is caused by inherited genetic changes is called hereditary breast cancer. There are also certain genetic changes that can raise your risk of breast cancer, including changes in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. These two changes also raise your risk of ovarian and other cancers. Besides genetics, your lifestyle and the environment can affect your risk of breast cancer. Who is at risk for breast cancer? The factors that raise your risk of breast cancer include: Older age History of breast cancer or benign (noncancer) breast disease Inherited risk of breast cancer, including having BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene changes Dense breast tissue A reproductive history that leads to more exposure to the estrogen hormone, including Menstruating at an early age Being at an older age when you first gave birth or never having given birth Starting menopause at a later age Taking hormone therapy for symptoms of menopause Radiation therapy to the breast or chest Obesity Drinking alcohol What are the signs and symptoms of breast cancer? The signs and symptoms of breast cancer include: A new lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the armpit. A change in the size or shape of the breast. A dimple or puckering in the skin of the breast. It may look like the skin of an orange. A nipple turned inward into the breast. Nipple discharge other than breast milk. The discharge might happen suddenly, be bloody, or happen in only one breast. Scaly, red, or swollen skin in the nipple area or the breast Pain in any area of the breast. How is breast cancer diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose breast cancer and figure out which type you have: A physical exam, including a clinical breast exam (CBE). This involves checking for any lumps or anything else that seems unusual with the breasts and armpits. A medical history. Imaging tests, such as a mammogram , an ultrasound , or an MRI . Breast biopsy . Blood chemistry tests, which measure different substances in the blood, including electrolytes, fats, proteins, glucose (sugar), and enzymes. Some of the specific blood chemistry tests include a basic metabolic panel (BMP) , a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) , and an electrolyte panel . If these tests show that you have breast cancer, you will have tests that study the cancer cells. These tests help your provider decide which treatment would be best for you. The tests may include: Genetic tests for genetic changes such as in the BRCA and TP53 genes. HER2 test . HER2 is a protein involved with cell growth. It is on the outside of all breast cells. If your breast cancer cells have more HER2 than normal, they can grow more quickly and spread to other parts of the body. An estrogen and progesterone receptor test. This test measures the amount of estrogen and progesterone ( hormones ) receptors in cancer tissue. If there are more receptors than normal, the cancer is called estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive. This type of breast cancer may grow more quickly. Another step is staging the cancer. Staging involves doing tests to find out whether the cancer has spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. The tests may include other diagnostic imaging tests and a sentinel lymph node biopsy. This biopsy is done to see whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. What are the treatments for breast cancer? Treatments for breast cancer include: Surgery such as A mastectomy , which removes the whole breast A lumpectomy to remove the cancer and some normal tissue around it, but not the breast itself Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Hormone therapy, which blocks cancer cells from getting the hormones they need to grow Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells Immunotherapy Can breast cancer be prevented? You may be able to help prevent breast cancer by making healthy lifestyle changes such as: Staying at a healthy weight Limiting alcohol use Getting enough exercise e Limiting your exposure to estrogen by Breastfeeding your babies if you can Limiting hormone therapy If you are at high risk, your health care provider may suggest that you take certain medicines to lower the risk. Some women at very high risk may decide to get a mastectomy (of their healthy breasts) to prevent breast cancer. It's also important to get regular mammograms. They may be able to identify breast cancer in the early stages, when it is easier to treat. NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus
Breast Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/breastdiseases.html,"Most women experience breast changes at some time. Your age, hormone levels, and medicines you take may cause lumps, bumps, and discharges (fluids that are not breast milk). If you have a breast lump, pain, discharge or skin irritation, see your health care provider. Minor and serious breast problems have similar  symptoms. Although many women fear cancer , most breast problems are not cancer. Some common breast changes are: Fibrocystic breast changes - lumpiness, thickening and swelling, often just before a woman's period Cysts - fluid-filled lumps Fibroadenomas - solid, round, rubbery lumps that move easily when pushed, occurring most in younger women Intraductal papillomas - growths similar to warts near the nipple Blocked milk ducts Milk production when a woman is not breastfeeding NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus
Breast Reconstruction,https://medlineplus.gov/breastreconstruction.html,"If you need a mastectomy , you have a choice about whether or not to have surgery to rebuild the shape of the breast. Instead of breast reconstruction, you could choose to wear a breast form that replaces the breast, wear padding inside your bra, or do nothing. All of these options have pros and cons. What is right for one woman may not be right for another. Breast reconstruction may be done at the same time as the mastectomy, or it may be done later on. If radiation therapy is part of the treatment plan, your doctor may suggest waiting until after radiation therapy. If you're thinking about breast reconstruction, talk to a plastic surgeon before the mastectomy, even if you plan to have your reconstruction later on. A surgeon can reconstruct the breast in many ways. Some women choose to have breast implants, which are filled with saline or silicone gel. Another method uses tissue taken from another part of your body. The plastic surgeon can take skin, muscle, and fat from your lower abdomen, back, or buttocks. The type of reconstruction that is best for you depends on your age, body type, and the type of cancer surgery that you had. A plastic surgeon can help you decide.

Certain types of cancer may occur less often in mothers who have breastfed their babies. Women who don't have health problems should try to give their babies breast milk for at least the first six months of life. Most women with health problems can breastfeed. There are rare exceptions when women are advised not to breastfeed because they have certain illnesses.  Some medicines, illegal drugs, and alcohol can also pass through the breast milk and cause harm to your baby.

A difference in power, meaning that the victim is weaker or is seen as weaker. For example, bullies may try to use physical strength, embarrassing information, or popularity to harm others. Repetition, meaning it happens more than once or that it probably will happen again What are the types of bullying? There are three types of bullying: Physical bullying involves hurting a person's body or belongings. Examples include hitting, kicking, and stealing or breaking someone's stuff. Social bullying (also called relational bullying) hurts someone's reputation or relationships. Some examples are spreading rumors, embarrassing someone in public, and making someone feel left out. Verbal bullying is saying or writing mean things, including name-calling, taunting, and threatening What is cyberbullying? Cyberbullying is bullying that happens through text messages or online. It could be through emails, social media, forums, or gaming. Some examples are: Posting rumors on social media Sharing embarrassing pictures or videos online Sharing someone else's private information online (doxing) Making threats against someone online Creating fake accounts and posting information to embarrass someone Certain types of cyberbullying can be illegal. The laws on cyberbullying are different from state to state. How is cyberbullying different from bullying? Cyberbullying is a type of bullying, but there are some differences between the two. Cyberbullying can be: Anonymous - people can hide their identities when they are online or using a cell phone Persistent - people can send messages instantly, at any time of the day or night Permanent - a lot of electronic communication is permanent and public, unless it's reported and removed. A bad online reputation can affect getting into college, getting a job, and other areas of life. This applies to the bully as well. Hard to notice - teachers and parents may not overhear or see cyberbullying taking place Which children are more likely to be bullied? Children are more likely to be bullied if they: Are seen as different from their peers, such as being overweight or underweight, dressing differently, or being of a different race/ethnicity Are seen as weak Have depression , anxiety , or low self-esteem Don't have many friends or are less popular Don't socialize well with others Have an intellectual or developmental disability Which children are more likely to be bullies?

C. diff Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/cdiffinfections.html,"What is C. diff ? C. diff is a bacterium that can cause diarrhea and more serious intestinal conditions such as colitis. You may see it called other names, such as Clostridioides difficile (the new name), Clostridium difficile (an older name), and C. diff icile. It causes close to half a million illnesses each year. What causes C. diff infections? C. diff bacteria are commonly found in the environment, but people usually only get C. diff infections when they are taking antibiotics . That's because antibiotics not only wipe out bad germs, but they also kill the good germs that protect your body against infections. The effect of antibiotics can last as long as several months. If you come in contact with C. diff germs during this time, you can get sick. You are more likely to get a C. diff infection if you take antibiotics for more than a week. C. diff spreads when people touch food, surfaces, or objects that are contaminated with feces (poop) from a person who has C. diff . Who is more likely to get a C. diff infection? You are at more likely to get a C. diff infection if you: Are taking antibiotics Are 65 or older Recently stayed in a hospital or nursing home Have a weakened immune system Have had a previous infection with C. diff or were exposed to it What are the symptoms of C. diff infections? The symptoms of C. diff infections include: Diarrhea (loose, watery stools) or frequent bowel movements for several days Fever Stomach tenderness or pain Loss of appetite Nausea Severe diarrhea causes you to lose a lot of fluids. This can put you at risk for dehydration . How are C. diff infections diagnosed? If you have been taking antibiotics recently and have symptoms of a C. diff infection, you should see your health care provider. Your provider will ask about your symptoms and do a lab test of your stool . In some cases, you might also need an imaging test such as an x-ray or CT scan to check for complications. What are the treatments for C. diff infections? Certain antibiotics can treat C. diff infections. If you were already taking a different antibiotic when you got C. diff , your provider may ask you to stop taking that one. If you have a severe case, you may need to stay in the hospital. If you have very severe pain or serious complications, you may need surgery to remove the diseased part of your colon. About 1 in 6 people who have had a C. diff infection will get it again within the following 2 to 8 weeks. This is called recurrent C. diff . It could be that your original infection came back or that you have a new infection. Contact your provider if your symptoms come back. For people who keep getting C. diff infections, treatments such as fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) have shown promising results. FMT uses stool (or bacteria from stool) from a healthy donor to try to restore the balance of healthy bacteria in your intestines. Can C. diff infections be prevented? There are steps you can take to try to prevent getting or spreading C. diff : Wash your hands with soap and water after you use the bathroom and before you eat. If you have diarrhea, clean the bathroom that you used before anyone else uses it. Use bleach mixed with water or another disinfectant to clean the toilet seat, handle, and lid. Health care providers can also help prevent C. diff infections by taking infection control precautions and improving how they prescribe antibiotics.

Caffeine,https://medlineplus.gov/caffeine.html,"What is caffeine? Caffeine is a bitter substance that occurs naturally in more than 60 plants including: Coffee beans Tea leaves Kola nuts, which are used to flavor soft drink colas Cacao pods, which are used to make chocolate products There is also synthetic (man-made) caffeine, which is added to some medicines, foods, and drinks. For example, some pain relievers, cold medicines, and over-the-counter medicines for alertness contain synthetic caffeine. So do energy drinks and ""energy-boosting"" gums and snacks. Most people consume caffeine from drinks. The amount of caffeine in different drinks can vary a lot, but it is generally: An 8-ounce cup of coffee: 95-200 mg A 12-ounce can of cola: 35-45 mg An 8-ounce energy drink: 70-100 mg An 8-ounce cup of tea: 14-60 mg What are caffeine's effects on the body? Caffeine has many effects on your body's metabolism. It: Stimulates your central nervous system, which can make you feel more awake and give you a boost of energy Is a diuretic, meaning that it helps your body get rid of extra salt and water by urinating more Increases the release of acid in your stomach, sometimes leading to an upset stomach or heartburn May interfere with the absorption of calcium in the body Increases your blood pressure Within one hour of eating or drinking caffeine, it reaches its peak level in your blood. You may continue to feel the effects of caffeine for four to six hours. What are the side effects from too much caffeine? For most people, it is not harmful to consume up to 400mg of caffeine a day. If you do eat or drink too much caffeine, it can cause health problems, such as: Restlessness and shakiness Insomnia Headaches Dizziness Fast heart rate Dehydration Anxiety Dependency, so you need to take more of it to get the same results Some people are more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than others. What are energy drinks, and why can they be a problem? Energy drinks are beverages that have added caffeine. The amount of caffeine in energy drinks can vary widely, and sometimes the labels on the drinks do not give you the actual amount of caffeine in them. Energy drinks may also contain sugars, vitamins, herbs, and supplements. Companies that make energy drinks claim that the drinks can increase alertness and improve physical and mental performance. This has helped make the drinks popular with American teens and young adults. There's limited data showing that energy drinks might temporarily improve alertness and physical endurance. There is not enough evidence to show that they enhance strength or power. But what we do know is that energy drinks can be dangerous because they have large amounts of caffeine. And since they have lots of sugar, they can contribute to weight gain and worsen diabetes. Sometimes young people mix their energy drinks with alcohol. It is dangerous to combine alcohol and caffeine. Caffeine can interfere with your ability to recognize how drunk you are, which can lead you to drink more. This also makes you more likely to make bad decisions. Who should avoid or limit caffeine? You should check with your health care provider about whether you should limit or avoid caffeine if you: Are pregnant , since caffeine passes through the placenta to your baby. Are breastfeeding , since a small amount of caffeine that you consume is passed along to your baby. Have sleep disorders , including insomnia. Have migraines or other chronic headaches. Have anxiety. Have GERD or ulcers . Have arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat). Have high blood pressure . Take certain medicines or supplements, including stimulants, certain antibiotics , asthma medicines, and heart medicines. Check with your health care provider about whether there might be interactions between caffeine and any medicines and supplements that you take. Are a child or teen. Neither should have as much caffeine as adults. Children can be especially sensitive to the effects of caffeine. What is caffeine withdrawal?

Your body stores almost all of its calcium in your bones and teeth to keep them strong. To help your muscles move. To help your nerves to carry messages between your brain and the rest of your body. To help your blood vessels move blood throughout your body. To help release hormones that affect many functions in your body. Not getting enough calcium can cause several conditions, including: Osteoporosis , a disease which can make your bones weaker and more likely to break. Rickets , a disease in children that causes soft, weak bones. Osteomalacia, a condition which causes soft bones in children and adults. How do I get calcium? You can get calcium from foods and supplements. You may be able to get enough calcium by eating a variety of foods, including: Dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt. These are the main food sources of calcium for most people in the United States. Leafy, green vegetables such as kale, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage (bok choi). Fish with soft bones that you can eat, such as canned sardines and salmon. Calcium-enriched foods such as breakfast cereals, fruit juices, soy and rice drinks, and tofu. The product labels for these foods will show how much calcium they have. Calcium is available in supplements. It is also included in many multivitamins. The two main forms of calcium supplements are calcium carbonate and calcium citrate: Calcium carbonate is absorbed best when taken with food. Some over-the-counter antacids, such as Tums and Rolaids, also contain calcium carbonate. Calcium citrate is absorbed well on an empty stomach or a full stomach. People with low levels of stomach acid absorb calcium citrate more easily than calcium carbonate. Calcium is absorbed best when you take 500 mg or less at one time. If you are taking more than that amount each day, take a smaller dose twice a day rather than taking it all at once. Calcium supplements might cause gas , bloating, and constipation in some people. If you have any of these symptoms, you could try: Spreading out the calcium dose throughout the day Taking it with meals Switching the form of calcium you take How much calcium do I need? The amount of calcium you need each day depends on your age and other factors.  The recommended amounts, in milligrams (mg), are: Birth to 6 months: 200 mg Infants 7-12 months: 260 mg Children 1-3 years: 700 mg Children 4-8 years: 1,000 mg Children 9-13 years: 1,300 mg Teens 14-18 years: 1,300 mg Adults 19-50 years: 1,000 mg Adult men 51-70 years: 1,000 mg Adult women 51-70 years: 1,200 mg Adults 71 years and older: 1,200 mg Pregnant and breastfeeding teens: 1,300 mg Pregnant and breastfeeding adults: 1,000 mg Certain people may have trouble getting enough calcium, including: Children and teens age 4 to 18 years People who are Black or Asian Adults age 50 years and older living in poverty Postmenopausal women; your body absorbs and retains less calcium after menopause People who don't drink milk or eat other dairy products Check with your health care provider to see if you need to take calcium supplements, and if so, how much you should take. Your provider may want to first do a calcium blood test to see if you are getting enough of it. NIH: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements",MedlinePlus
Campylobacter Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/campylobacterinfections.html,"Campylobacter infection is a common foodborne illness . You usually get it from eating contaminated food, especially raw or undercooked poultry. You can also get it from drinking contaminated water or raw milk, or handling infected animal feces (poop). Some infected people don't have any symptoms.  If you do have symptoms, they start two to five days after you are infected. They usually last about one week, and can include: Diarrhea (which could be bloody) Cramping Abdominal pain Fever Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Health care providers use stool tests to make a diagnosis. Most people get better without treatment. You should drink extra fluids for as long as the diarrhea lasts. People who have a severe infection or a weakened immune system may need to take antibiotics . In rare cases, the infection can cause reactive arthritis or Guillain-Barre syndrome . To prevent Campylobacter infection, cook poultry thoroughly. Use a separate cutting board and utensils for meats. Make sure to clean them carefully with soap and hot water after you use them.

Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/cancer.html,"What is cancer? Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Usually, your body forms new cells as needed, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer, while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of your body. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the type of cancer and how advanced it is. What are the types of cancer? There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Cancer can start almost anywhere in your body. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast. Cancer may also be described by the type of cell that formed it, such as sarcoma if cancer begins in your bone and soft tissue. Carcinoma is the most common type of cancer. It is formed by epithelial cells, the cells that cover the inside and outside surfaces of your body. How does cancer develop? Cancer is a genetic disease. That means changes in your genes cause it. Changes in your genes are also called gene variants or mutations. Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. However, only some cancers are caused by genes passed down from your parents. Genetic changes can occur to your genes over your lifetime that affect how your cells function. Usually, your body gets rid of damaged cells before they turn cancerous, but this ability goes down as you age. Other factors that may affect your risk of developing cancer can include: Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun Smoking Your diet Physical inactivity What are the symptoms of cancer? Cancer symptoms depend on the type of cancer. For example, some of the symptoms that cancer may cause can include: A lump in your breast Blood in your urine (pee) or stool (poop) Bleeding or bruising for no known reason A sore that doesn't heal Trouble swallowing A new mole or a change to a mole you already have Cancer may cause various symptoms but often doesn't cause pain. Don't wait until you're having pain before seeing your health care provider. See your provider if you have symptoms that don't get better in a few weeks. How is cancer diagnosed? There is no single test that can diagnose cancer. The tests ordered are usually based on your symptoms. Your provider may: Ask about your medical history Ask about your family health history , including relatives who have had cancer Do a physical exam Do a screening test such as a mammogram , colonoscopy , or a Pap test Order blood tests or imaging tests To find out if you have cancer, your provider may order a biopsy . A biopsy is the procedure of removing and examining tissue, cells, or fluids from your body. What are the treatments for cancer? Treatment depends on the type of cancer and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery, radiation , and/or chemotherapy . Some may involve hormone therapy, immunotherapy or other types of biological therapy, or stem cell transplantation . Can cancer be prevented? It's usually not possible to know exactly why cancer develops in some people but not others. There are some things that you can't control which may increase or decrease your risk of getting cancer, such as inheriting certain genes or your age. But some lifestyle habits may increase your risk of certain types of cancer. Avoid or reduce lifestyle habits such as: Smoking and tobacco use Having too much sun exposure Drinking too much alcohol Not getting enough physical activity Having obesity NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus
Cancer Alternative Therapies,https://medlineplus.gov/canceralternativetherapies.html,"What are complementary and alternative therapies for cancer care? You have many choices to make about your cancer treatment. One choice you might consider is using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). CAM is the term for medical products and therapies that are not part of standard medical care. CAM for cancer treatment involves caring for your mind, body, and spirit. Some methods focus on your breathing or body movements to help you relax. Other CAM therapies may use special foods, supplements , or diets. Examples of CAM therapies include acupuncture , chiropractic , and herbal medicines . CAM claims can sound promising, but often, researchers don't know how safe some are or how well they work. Studies are ongoing to find out the safety and usefulness of many of these methods. How are complementary and alternative therapies used for cancer care? If you're thinking about using CAM along with your standard care, it's called integrative medicine. Some methods, such as acupuncture, might help with nausea , pain, and other side effects of cancer treatment. A few reasons that people with cancer may use CAM include to: Help cope with the side effects of cancer treatments Ease worries about cancer treatment and related stress Feel that they are doing something more to help their care CAM treatments don't work for everyone. Some products might interact with your other medicines. Talk to your health care provider about all the different types of treatment you use. Your provider can help you make sure that everything you're using for your cancer care works well together. NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus
Cancer Chemotherapy,https://medlineplus.gov/cancerchemotherapy.html,"What is cancer chemotherapy? Cancer chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment. It uses medicines to destroy cancer cells. Normally, the cells in your body grow and die in a controlled way. Cancer cells keep growing without control. Chemotherapy works by killing the cancer cells, stopping them from spreading, or slowing their growth. Chemotherapy is used to: Treat cancer by curing the cancer, lessening the chance it will return, or stopping or slowing its growth. Ease cancer symptoms by shrinking tumors that are causing pain and other problems. What are the side effects of chemotherapy? Chemotherapy does not just destroy cancer cells. It can also harm some healthy cells, which causes side effects. You may have a lot of side effects, some side effects, or none at all. It depends on the type and amount of chemotherapy you get and how your body reacts. Some common side effects are: Mouth sores Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Pain Hair loss There are ways to prevent or control some side effects. Talk with your health care provider about how to manage them. Healthy cells usually recover after chemotherapy is over, so most side effects gradually go away. What can I expect when getting chemotherapy? You may get chemotherapy in a hospital or at home, a doctor's office, or a medical clinic. You might be given the medicines by mouth, in a shot, as a cream, through a catheter, or intravenously (by IV). Your treatment plan will depend on the type of cancer you have, which chemotherapy medicines are used, the treatment goals, and how your body responds to the medicines. Chemotherapy may be given alone or with other treatments. You may get treatment every day, every week, or every month. You may have breaks between treatments so that your body has a chance to build new healthy cells. NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus
Cancer Immunotherapy,https://medlineplus.gov/cancerimmunotherapy.html,"What is immunotherapy? Immunotherapy is a cancer treatment that helps your immune system fight cancer. It is a type of biological therapy. Biological therapy uses substances made from living organisms or versions of these substances made in a lab. Immunotherapy isn't used for all cancers, and the response to treatment varies. If you're getting immunotherapy, your health care provider will monitor your treatment closely. When is immunotherapy used for cancer treatment? Immunotherapy isn't used as often as other cancer treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy , and radiation therapy . But immunotherapy is used for some types of cancer, and researchers are doing clinical trials to see whether it also works for other types. How does immunotherapy work against cancer? Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Usually, your body forms new cells as needed, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. When you have cancer, some of your cells begin to multiply without stopping, and old cells don't die when they should. They spread into the surrounding tissues. One reason cancer cells can keep growing and spreading is that they can hide from your immune system. Some immunotherapies can ""mark"" your cancer cells. This makes it easier for your immune system to find and destroy the cells. It is a type of targeted therapy that uses medicines or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. Other types of immunotherapies work by boosting your immune system to work better against cancer. How is immunotherapy given? There are different forms of immunotherapy, so how they are given varies. You could get immunotherapy intravenously (by IV), in pills or capsules, or cream for your skin. For bladder cancer, they might place it directly into your bladder. How often and how long you get immunotherapy also varies. It depends on your type of cancer, how advanced it is, the type of immunotherapy you get, and how well it is working. You may have treatment every day, week, or month. Some immunotherapies are given in cycles, so your body has time to rest and recover. What are the side effects of immunotherapy? You may have side effects. The most common side effects are skin reactions at the needle site if you get it by IV. Other side effects may include flu-like symptoms or, rarely, severe reactions.

Cancer--Living with Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/cancerlivingwithcancer.html,"Learning to live with cancer Cancer is a common disease. Many Americans will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes. Even though cancer may be life-threatening, many people have successful treatment. Others live with cancer for a very long time. For most people with cancer, learning to live with the disease is one of the biggest challenges they've ever faced. That's because having cancer touches just about every part of your life and the lives of those around you. Cancer and its treatment may change: Your daily routines and ability to work Your important relationships The way you look, feel, and think about yourself If you learn what to expect, you may feel more in control and prepared to cope with these changes. Your health care provider can help you find information and support services that are right for you. Coping with feelings about having cancer Having cancer may cause a range of strong emotions, such as sadness, anger, fear, worry, or guilt. These feelings are normal, and they're likely to change over time. It's helpful to sort out your feelings in a way that's comfortable for you. You might try: Talking openly with someone you trust Writing about your feelings Using relaxation methods, such as meditation and other complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) Doing the things you enjoy,  giving yourself a break from focusing on cancer If your emotions seem to take over your life, tell your provider. You may need extra support if you have symptoms of depression , stress , anxiety , or panic disorder . Communicating with your health care team During cancer treatment, you usually have a team of providers. Along with doctors and nurses, you may be able to talk with social workers, pharmacists, dietitians, and other health professionals. These professionals are prepared to help you deal with the issues that cancer brings up, including concerns about finances . But it's up to you to let your team know what's on your mind. Good communication with your providers may help you feel more in control and satisfied with your care. Your communications may be better if you: Tell your providers how much you want to know about your cancer and its treatment. Do you want all the details or just the big picture? Write down your questions and concerns before your visits. Bring a family member or a friend to your visits. This person can help by listening, taking notes, and asking questions. Talking openly with family and friends Cancer changes the daily routines and roles of the people who love and support you. They may need to start doing the things you've always done for them. And you may need their help doing things you've always done for yourself. These changes can be difficult for everyone. It may help to have an honest talk about changing roles and needs. If that sounds too hard, ask a social worker or another member of your care team to help you talk with family and friends who are helping with your care.  These caregivers may need some support , too. Dealing with changes in your self-image Cancer and its treatment may cause some big changes in how you look, feel, and think about yourself. For example, you may have: Less energy Temporary or permanent changes in your body, such as scars , or hair loss from chemotherapy Problems being sexually close or doubts about dating Coping with these changes can be hard. But most people find ways to feel more positive over time. If you feel well enough, you might try: Exercise . Walking, yoga, or other types of movement may help you feel stronger and more in control of your body. But check with your provider first. Staying involved in life and helping others. Think about volunteering, hobbies, or other activities that might make you feel good about yourself. Counseling for sexual problems. Talking with a professional, either with a partner or on your own, may help. Adjusting to life after treatment After treatment, you'll have regular cancer follow-up care. Your provider will explain the schedule of checkups and tests you'll need. This is a good time to discuss the challenges you may face ahead.

Carbohydrate Metabolism Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/carbohydratemetabolismdisorders.html,"Metabolism is the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Food is made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Chemicals in your digestive system (enzymes) break the food parts down into sugars and acids, your body's fuel. Your body can use this fuel right away, or it can store the energy in your body tissues. If you have a metabolic disorder , something goes wrong with this process. Carbohydrate metabolism disorders are a group of metabolic disorders. Normally your enzymes break carbohydrates down into glucose (a type of sugar). If you have one of these disorders, you may not have enough enzymes to break down the carbohydrates. Or the enzymes may not work properly. This causes a harmful amount of sugar to build up in your body. That can lead to health problems, some of which can be serious. Some of the disorders are fatal. These disorders are inherited. Newborn babies get screened for many of them, using blood tests. If there is a family history of one of these disorders, parents can get genetic testing to see whether they carry the gene. Other genetic tests can tell whether the fetus has the disorder or carries the gene for the disorder. Treatments may include special diets, supplements, and medicines. Some babies may also need additional treatments, if there are complications. For some disorders, there is no cure, but treatments may help with symptoms.",MedlinePlus
Carbohydrates,https://medlineplus.gov/carbohydrates.html,"What are carbohydrates? Carbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules. Along with proteins and fats , carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and drinks. Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or blood sugar , is the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs. Glucose can be used immediately or stored in the liver and muscles for later use. What are the different types of carbohydrates? There are three main types of carbohydrates: Sugars. They are also called simple carbohydrates because they are in the most basic form. They can be added to foods, such as the sugar in candy, desserts, processed foods, and regular soda. They also include the kinds of sugar that are found naturally in fruits, vegetables, and milk. Starches. They are complex carbohydrates, which are made of lots of simple sugars strung together. Your body needs to break starches down into sugars to use them for energy. Starches include bread, cereal, and pasta. They also include certain vegetables, like potatoes, peas, and corn. Fiber . It is also a complex carbohydrate. Your body cannot break down most fibers, so eating foods with fiber can help you feel full and make you less likely to overeat. Diets high in fiber have other health benefits. They may help prevent stomach or intestinal problems, such as constipation . They may also help lower cholesterol and blood sugar. Fiber is found in many foods that come from plants, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans, and whole grains. Which foods have carbohydrates? Common foods with carbohydrates include: Grains, such as bread, noodles, pasta, crackers, cereals, and rice Fruits, such as apples, bananas, berries, mangoes, melons, and oranges Dairy products, such as milk and yogurt Legumes, including dried beans, lentils, and peas Snack foods and sweets, such as cakes, cookies, candy, and other desserts Juices, regular sodas, fruit drinks, sports drinks, and energy drinks that contain sugar Starchy vegetables, such as potatoes, corn, and peas Some foods don't have a lot of carbohydrates, such as meat, fish, poultry, some types of cheese, nuts, and oils. Which types of carbohydrates should I eat? You do need to eat some carbohydrates to give your body energy. But it's important to eat the right kinds of carbohydrates for your health: When eating grains, choose mostly whole grains and not refined grains: Whole grains are foods like whole-wheat bread, brown rice, whole cornmeal, and oatmeal. They offer lots of nutrients that your body needs, like vitamins , minerals , and fiber. To figure out whether a product has a lot of whole grain, check the ingredients list on the package and see if a whole grain is one of the first few items listed. Refined grains are foods that have had some parts of the grains removed. This also removes some of the nutrients that are good for your health. Eat foods with lots of fiber. The Nutrition Facts labels on the back of food packages tells you how much fiber a product has. Try to avoid foods that have a lot of added sugar. These foods can have many calories but not much nutrition. Eating too much added sugar raises your blood sugar and can make you gain weight. You can tell if a food or drink has added sugars by looking at the Nutrition Facts label on the back of the food package. It tells you how much total sugar and added sugar is in that food or drink. How many carbohydrates should I eat? There is no one-size-fits-all amount of carbohydrates that people should eat. This amount can vary, depending on factors such as your age, sex, health, and whether or not you are trying to lose or gain weight. On average, people should get 45 to 65% of their calories from carbohydrates every day. On the Nutrition Facts labels, the Daily Value for total carbohydrates is 275 g per day. This is based on a 2,000-calorie daily diet. Your Daily Value may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs and health. Is it safe to eat a low-carb diet? Some people go on a low-carb diet to try to lose weight. This usually means eating between 25 g and 150 g of carbs each day. This kind of diet can be safe, but you should talk to your health care provider before starting it. One problem with low-carb diets is that they can limit the amount of fiber you get each day. They can also be hard to stay on for the long term.",MedlinePlus

Depression and obesity can raise the risk of these diseases even more. Problems with short-term memory or paying attention What can I do to prevent or relieve caregiver stress? Taking steps to prevent or relieve caregiver stress may help prevent health problems. Remember that if you feel better, you can take better care of your loved one. It will also be easier to focus on the rewards of caregiving. Some ways to help yourself include: Learning better ways to help your loved one. For examples, hospitals offer classes that can teach you how to care for someone with an injury or illness. Finding caregiving resources in your community to help you. Many communities have adult daycare services or respite services. Using one of these can give you a break from your caregiving duties. Asking for and accepting help. Make a list of ways others can help you. Let helpers choose what they would like to do. For instance, someone might sit with the person you care for while you do an errand. Someone else might pick up groceries for you. Joining a support group for caregivers. A support group can allow you to share stories, pick up caregiving tips, and get support from others who face the same challenges as you do. Being organized to make caregiving more manageable. Make to-do lists and set a daily routine. Staying in touch with family and friends. It's important for you to have emotional support. Taking care of your own health.

Carotid Artery Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/carotidarterydisease.html,"Your carotid arteries are two large blood vessels in your neck. They supply your brain and head with blood.  If you have carotid artery disease, the arteries become narrow or blocked, usually because of atherosclerosis . Atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaque, which is made up of fat, cholesterol , calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Carotid artery disease is serious because it can block the blood flow to your brain, causing a stroke . Too much plaque in the artery can cause a blockage. You can also have a blockage when a piece of plaque or a blood clot breaks off the wall of an artery. The plaque or clot can travel through the bloodstream and get stuck in one of your brain's smaller arteries. Carotid artery disease often does not cause symptoms until the blockage or narrowing is severe.  One sign may be a bruit (whooshing sound) that your doctor hears when listening to your artery with a stethoscope. Another sign is a transient ischemic attack (TIA), a ""mini-stroke."" A TIA is like a stroke, but it only lasts a few minutes, and the symptoms usually go away within an hour. Stroke is another sign. Imaging tests can confirm whether you have carotid artery disease. Treatments may include: Healthy lifestyle changes Medicines Carotid endarterectomy, surgery to remove the plaque Angioplasty , a procedure to place a balloon and stent into the artery to open it and hold it open NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/carpaltunnelsyndrome.html,"What is carpal tunnel syndrome? Carpal tunnel syndrome is the name for a group of problems that includes numbness, tingling, weakness, or pain in your wrist or hand . It's a very common condition that happens when a nerve in your wrist becomes squeezed. The carpal tunnel is a narrow opening between the bones in your wrist and the ligament that holds them together.  A nerve, called the median nerve, runs from your lower arm through the carpal tunnel and into your hand. This nerve provides feeling to your thumb and first three fingers.  It also helps you move your thumb. Tendons also run from your lower arm, through the carpal tunnel, and into your hand. The tendons connect your finger bones to muscles in your arm, so you can bend your fingers. If the tendons become swollen or irritated inside the carpal tunnel, they may press on the nerve. The squeezed nerve may not work well, which can lead to numbness, weakness, and other symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. What causes carpal tunnel syndrome? In certain cases, the cause of carpal tunnel syndrome is unknown. But it usually happens from a combination of things that affect the structures in your wrist, such as: Injury to your wrist that causes swelling, such as a sprain or broken bone Health conditions that can affect your nerves , joints , or other parts of your wrist, for example: Diabetes . Rheumatoid arthritis . A cyst or tumor in your wrist. Changes in  certain hormones , which may cause swelling from extra fluid in your body. Examples include an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), pregnancy and menopause. Problems with the way your wrist is formed. Doing the same wrist and hand movements over and over, such as: Assembly line work. Carpentry or using tools that vibrate. Knitting, gardening, or sports, such as golf. Researchers aren't sure whether long-term typing or computer use leads to carpal tunnel syndrome. Who is more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome? Carpal tunnel syndrome usually happens only in adults. You're more likely to develop it if you: Are a woman. Women are three times more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome than men. Have a health condition that may affect structures in your wrist. Do activities with repeated hand motions. Have had a wrist injury. Have a close relative who has had carpal tunnel syndrome, such as a parent, brother or sister. What are the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome? You may feel numbness, tingling or burning in your fingers, especially in your thumb, index, and middle fingers. Symptoms often affect both hands. In the early stages, symptoms usually: Start slowly in your dominant hand (the one you write with) Happen at night if you sleep with your wrists bent As symptoms get worse, you may notice: Tingling, pain, or weakness with certain activities, such as driving or holding a phone Difficulty grasping or holding small things Feeling like your fingers are swollen when they're not Without treatment, you could lose feeling in some fingers and have permanent weakness in your thumb. But early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent lasting damage. How is carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosed? To find out if you have carpal tunnel syndrome, your health care provider will: Ask about your medical history Ask about your family health history Do a physical exam Order tests if needed , such as: Lab tests to look for diseases that may damage nerves X-rays to look for broken bones or arthritis Tests to measure the electrical activity in your nerves and muscles Ultrasound to check the nerve in the carpal tunnel What are the treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome? It's easier to treat carpal tunnel syndrome early on, so you should start treatment as soon as possible. Your provider will first treat any health conditions you have that may cause your symptoms. The next step would be treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome. They may include: Wrist splints (usually worn at night). Rest. Medicines to reduce swelling and pain: Over-the-counter pain relievers , such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium. Prescription steroids , either pills or an injection (shot) into your wrist. Other therapies (complementary and integrative medicine) . Research shows that yoga may help with pain and weakness. Some people may find acupuncture and chiropractic care helpful, but research hasn't shown that these therapies can improve carpal tunnel syndrome. If you want to try other therapies, talk with your provider first. Surgery to make more space in the carpal tunnel. Surgery may be an option if your symptoms are severe and other treatments don't work. It involves cutting the wrist ligament to take pressure off the nerve.  Recovery may take months. Carpal tunnel syndrome rarely comes back after surgery, but mild symptoms may last. Can carpal tunnel syndrome be prevented? You may help prevent carpal tunnel syndrome if you protect your wrists: Use good posture to keep your wrists in a natural position. Keep your hands warm to keep your muscles flexible. Fingerless gloves may help. Take work breaks and vary your tasks. Stretch and exercise your hands and wrists. Organize your workspace and tools to reduce strain on your hands and wrists.",MedlinePlus

Celiac Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/celiacdisease.html,"What is celiac disease? Celiac disease is a chronic (long-term) digestive and immune disorder that damages your small intestine. The damage may prevent your body from absorbing vitamins , minerals , and other nutrients from the food you eat. This can lead to malnutrition and other serious health problems Celiac disease is triggered by eating foods that contain gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and other grains. It may also be in other products like vitamins and supplements , hair and skin products, toothpastes, and lip balm. Celiac disease is different from gluten sensitivity . Both involve problems with gluten and can cause some of the same symptoms, such as abdominal (belly) pain and fatigue . But gluten sensitivity does not damage the small intestine like celiac disease does. Wheat allergy, a type of food allergy , is also different. With both celiac disease and wheat allergy, your immune system is reacting to wheat. But with wheat allergy, you can have some different symptoms, such as itchy eyes or trouble breathing . And a wheat allergy will not cause long-term damage to the small intestine. What causes celiac disease? The exact cause of celiac disease is not known. Research suggests that celiac disease only happens in people who have certain genes and eat food that contains gluten. Researchers are studying other factors that may play a role in causing the disease. Who is more likely to develop celiac disease? Celiac disease is more common if you: Have a family member who has the disease Have Down syndrome , Turner syndrome , or Williams syndrome Are White Are female What are the symptoms of celiac disease? The symptoms of celiac disease can be different from person to person. Sometimes the symptoms may come and go. Some people may not notice any symptoms. Some of the possible symptoms affect your digestive system. Digestive symptoms are more common in children than in adults. The digestive symptoms include: Bloating (feeling fullness or swelling in your belly) Chronic (long-term) diarrhea or greasy, bulky, unusually bad-smelling stool (poop) Constipation Gas Lactose intolerance because of damage to the small intestine Nausea and vomiting Pain in the abdomen (belly) Weight loss in adults, or not enough weight gain in children Some people with celiac disease have symptoms that affect other parts of the body, such as: Fatigue Depression and anxiety Irritability (in children) Dermatitis herpetiformis, an itchy rash with blisters (mainly in adults) Bone or joint pain Symptoms involving the mouth, such as canker sores or dry mouth What other problems can celiac disease cause? Over time, celiac disease can cause other health problems, especially if it is not treated. These problems can include: Malnutrition Anemia , especially iron-deficiency anemia Bone loss Nervous system problems such as headaches , balance problems , or peripheral neuropathy Reproductive problems, such as missed menstrual periods and miscarriages in women and infertility in men and women How is celiac disease diagnosed? If you have symptoms of celiac disease, your health care provider will look for signs that you might have celiac disease. To do this, your provider will get your medical and family history and do a physical exam. If your provider thinks that you could have celiac disease, you will have some tests. Providers most often use blood tests and biopsies of the small intestine to diagnose celiac disease. The biopsy would be done during an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. For this procedure, your provider uses an endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera) to see the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. It also allows your provider to take a sample of tissue for a biopsy. What are the treatments for celiac disease? The treatment for celiac disease is following a gluten-free diet for the rest of your life. Sticking with a gluten-free diet will treat or prevent many of the symptoms and other health problems caused by celiac disease. In most cases, it can also heal damage in the small intestine and prevent more damage. Your provider may refer you to a registered dietician (a nutrition expert) who can help you learn how to eat a healthy diet without gluten. You will also need to avoid all hidden sources of gluten, such as certain supplements, cosmetics, toothpaste, etc. Reading product labels can sometimes help you avoid gluten. If a label doesn't tell you what is in a product, check with the company that makes the product for an ingredients list. Don't just assume that a product is gluten-free if it doesn't mention it.

Cerebral Palsy,https://medlineplus.gov/cerebralpalsy.html,"What is cerebral palsy (CP)? Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of neurologic disorders that cause problems with movement , balance , and posture. The first part of the name, cerebral, means having to do with the brain. The second part, palsy, means weakness or problems with using the muscles. CP can range from mild to severe. The brain damage and the disabilities it causes are permanent. But treatments can improve the lives of people who have the condition. For example, treatments can help to improve their motor skills and ability to communicate. What are the types of cerebral palsy (CP)? There are different types of CP: Spastic cerebral palsy , which is the most common type. It causes increased muscle tone, stiff muscles, and awkward movements. Sometimes it only affects one part of the body. In other cases, it can affect both arms and legs, the trunk, and the face. Dyskinetic cerebral palsy , which causes problems controlling the movement of the hands, arms, feet, and legs. This can make it hard to sit and walk. Ataxic cerebral palsy , which causes problems with balance and coordination. Mixed cerebral palsy , which means that you have symptoms of more than one type. What causes cerebral palsy (CP)? CP is caused by abnormal development or damage to the developing brain. When this development or damage happens before birth, it is called congenital CP. Most CP is congenital, and its causes may include: Gene changes (variants) Brain malformations Infections or fevers in the pregnant parent An injury to the developing baby CP can also happen during or after birth. CP that happens more than 28 days after birth is called acquired CP. Its causes can include: Brain damage in the first few months or years of life Infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis Problems with blood flow to the brain, for example from a stroke or abnormal blood vessels Head injuries , for example from a car accident, a fall , or child abuse In some cases, the cause of congenital or acquired CP is unknown. Who is more likely to develop cerebral palsy (CP)? Certain medical conditions or events that can happen during pregnancy and delivery may increase a baby's risk of congenital cerebral palsy. These may include: Being born too small Being born too early Being born a twin or other multiple birth Being conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) or other assisted reproductive technology (ART) Infections Health problems in the pregnant parent, such as thyroid problems and seizures Severe newborn jaundice Having complications during birth Rh incompatibility Exposure to toxic chemicals during pregnancy What are the signs of cerebral palsy (CP)? There are many different types and levels of disability with CP. So the signs can be different in each child. These signs usually appear in the early months of life. They may include: Developmental delays. Your child may be slow to reach developmental milestones such as learning to roll over, sit, crawl, or walk. Abnormal muscle tone. Your child may seem floppy, or they may be stiff or rigid. An unusual posture or favoring one side of the body when reaching, crawling, or moving. Stiff or tight muscles and exaggerated reflexes (spasticity). Shaking ( tremor ) of arms, legs, hands, or feet. Sudden, uncontrolled movements. It's important to know that children without CP can also have these signs. Contact your child's health care provider if your child has any of these signs, so you can get a correct diagnosis. How is cerebral palsy (CP) diagnosed? Diagnosing CP involves several steps: Developmental monitoring (or surveillance) means tracking a child's growth and development over time. If there are any concerns about your child's development, they should have a developmental screening test as soon as possible. Developmental screening involves giving your child a short test to check for motor, movement, or other developmental delays. If the screenings are not normal, the provider will recommend more evaluations. Developmental and medical evaluations are done to diagnose which disorder your child has. To make the diagnosis, your provider: Will check your child's motor skills, muscle tone, reflexes, and posture Will ask about their medical history May order lab tests, genetic tests , and/or imaging tests What are the treatments for cerebral palsy (CP)? There is no cure for CP, but treatment can improve the lives of those who have it. It is important to begin a treatment program as early as possible. A team of health professionals will work with you and your child to develop a treatment plan. Common treatments include: Medicines Surgery Assistive devices such as braces and walkers Physical, occupational, recreational, and speech therapy Can cerebral palsy (CP) be prevented? You cannot prevent the genetic problems that can cause CP. But it may be possible to manage or avoid some of the risk factors for CP. For example: If you are pregnant, make sure that you are vaccinated against infections that could cause CP in your developing baby. Get regular prenatal care , which can reduce the risk of preterm birth or having a low birthweight baby. It can also help you manage any health conditions that could raise the risk of CP. Use car seats for your baby to prevent head injuries that could cause CP.",MedlinePlus
Cervical Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/cervicalcancer.html,"What is cervical cancer? Cervical cancer is cancer that starts in the cells of the cervix. The cervix is part of the female reproductive system. It is the lower, narrow end of the uterus (womb), which opens into the vagina (birth canal). Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. Before cervical cells become cancer, they start to look abnormal. These cells are called ""precancers."" If they aren't destroyed or removed, they may become cancer cells that grow out of control and spread to other parts of your body. Screening tests for cervical cancer can help find abnormal cells so you can get treatment to prevent cervical cancer. These tests can also find cervical cancer early when it's usually easier to treat. What causes cervical cancer? Almost all cervical cancers are caused by a long-lasting infection with a virus called human papillomavirus (HPV) . There are many types of HPV. The types that cause cancer are called ""high-risk HPV."" High-risk HPV is very common. It can be passed from one person to another through close skin-to-skin touching, usually during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Most people who are infected have no symptoms and don't know they have it. If you're infected with high-risk HPV, usually your immune system will get rid of it within a year or two. But if your immune system can't control the infection, it may last for many years. Over time, HPV can turn normal cervical cells into abnormal cells. Without treatment, these cells may keep changing until they become cervical cancer. Who is more likely to develop cervical cancer? Cervical cancer is most common in people over age 30. If you have a high-risk HPV infection in your cervix, you're more likely to develop cervical cancer if you: Have a weakened immune system because you: Have a disease that harms your immune system, such as HIV . Take medicine to control your immune system, such as certain medicines to treat cancer or autoimmune diseases Smoke tobacco or breathe secondhand smoke . Use birth control pills or have given birth to many children. Have obesity . Were exposed to a medicine called DES (diethylstilbestrol) before you were born. Between 1940-1971, DES was sometimes prescribed during pregnancy to prevent miscarriages . DES was later linked to health problems, including cervical cancer. What are the symptoms of cervical cancer? Cervical cancer usually doesn't cause symptoms when it first starts to grow. But when it does cause symptoms, they may include: Vaginal bleeding that's not normal for you, such as bleeding after sex or between menstrual periods Vaginal discharge (fluid) that's watery and has a strong odor or contains blood Pelvic pain or pain during sex If cervical cancer spreads to other parts of your body, symptoms may include: Unusual vaginal bleeding or discharge Pelvic pain or pain during sex Difficult or painful bowel movements (poops) or bleeding from the rectum when having a bowel movement Difficult or painful urination (peeing) or blood in your urine (pee) Dull backache Swollen legs Abdominal (belly) pain Fatigue How is cervical cancer diagnosed? If you have symptoms or had an abnormal result on a screening test for cervical cancer, your health care provider will do more tests to find out if you have cervical cancer. They will: Ask about your medical history and your family health history Do a pelvic exam Suggest tests to diagnose or rule out cervical cancer, including: Colposcopy , a procedure using a device called a colposcope, which helps your provider examine your cervix for abnormal areas Cervical biopsy , a procedure to remove a tissue sample from your cervix so that it can be examined under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. Most biopsies can be done in your provider's office What are the treatments for cervical cancer? Different treatments are available for cervical cancer. The best treatment for you depends on your health, how much cancer you have, whether it has spread, and which treatment you prefer. You may have more than one treatment, including: Surgery to remove the cancer. Radiation therapy , which uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. The therapy may use radiation from a machine, or a radioactive substance may be placed in your body near the cancer. Chemotherapy (chemo), which uses special medicines to shrink or kill the cancer. The medicine may be pills, or it may be given through a vein (by IV). Sometimes, both types of chemo are used. Targeted therapy , which uses special medicines to block the growth and spread of cancer cells. Immunotherapy , which helps your immune system fight cancer cells. Can cervical cancer be prevented? Almost all cervical cancer can be prevented by: HPV vaccination . HPV vaccines provide the most protection if you get them before you're exposed to HPV. So, it's best to get vaccinated before you become sexually active.  Medical experts recommend vaccinating children between ages 9 and 12. Routine cervical cancer screening. Two types of screening tests may be part of your routine health checkup. Both tests use a sample of cervical cells that your provider collects with a swab: A Pap smear checks for abnormal cells so they can be treated before they become cancer An HPV test checks for high-risk HPV infections that can cause cancer. Getting the right follow-up treatment if a screening test finds abnormal cells and/or high-risk HPV. You can lower your risk for cervical cancer by not smoking. Using condoms correctly during sex lowers your risk of getting an HPV infection, but doesn't prevent it completely.  Condom use has been linked to fewer cases of cervical cancer. If you or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus

The types that cause cancer are called ""high-risk HPV."" The HPV/Pap cotest uses an HPV and Pap test together to check for both high-risk HPV and cervical cell changes. If your screening tests are abnormal, your provider may do more tests, such as a biopsy . How often you should be screened for cervical cancer and which tests you should get will depend on your age and health history. What are the possible benefits and harms of cervical cancer screening? Cervical cancer screening saves lives. Screening can detect cervical changes early, lowering your chance of dying from cervical cancer. But, cervical cancer screening has potential harms. The possible harms of cervical cancer screening include: The results can sometimes be wrong. Getting a false-positive result means that your test results appear abnormal, but there are no precancerous or cancerous cells. A false-positive may lead to: Worry while you have more tests to look for signs of cancer. Follow-up tests or treatment that you may not have needed. Getting a false-negative result means that your test results appear normal, but there are precancer or cancerous cells. A false-negative may lead to: You may delay seeking treatment even if you have symptoms. Should I be screened for cervical cancer? Talk with your provider about how often you should be screened for cervical cancer and which tests you should get. This will depend on your age and health history. If you have a cervix, it's recommended that you have your first Pap smear at age 21 and begin screening with an HPV test at age 25. You may need screening more often if you: Had an abnormal HPV test, Pap smear, or cervical biopsy in the recent past. Have had a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Have a weakened immune system . Were exposed to a drug called DES (Diethylstilbestrol) before you were born. Between the years 1940-1971, DES was sometimes prescribed to prevent miscarriages . If you are over age 65 and have had regular Pap smear screenings with normal results, your provider may tell you that you no longer need them. If you have HIV , you may need to continue screenings after age 65. You don't need cervical cancer screening if you had a total hysterectomy (surgery to remove your uterus and cervix) because of a condition that was not cancer. But if your hysterectomy was related to cervical cancer or precancer, ask your provider whether you need screening. NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus
Cervix Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/cervixdisorders.html,"What is a cervix disorder? A cervix disorder is a problem with your cervix. The cervix is part of the female reproductive system. It is the lower, narrow end of the uterus (womb), which opens into the vagina (birth canal). The cervix has a small opening that expands during childbirth. It also allows menstrual blood to leave your body. You may not have any symptoms of a cervix disorder, but routine pelvic exams and a Pap smear test can help determine if you may need treatment. Cervix disorders can include: Cervical cancer is a cancer that starts in the cells of the cervix. Cervicitis is swelling of the cervix. An infection usually causes it, but it can also be caused by skin irritation. Treatment can help you avoid potential complications like pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) . Cervical incompetence (also called cervical insufficiency) can happen during pregnancy. The opening of your cervix widens too early. This may cause you to give birth too soon , or you could lose the fetus . Cervical polyps and cysts are fleshy or fluid-filled growths on your cervix. These growths are usually benign (not cancer). They are more common during your reproductive years, especially after age 20. Who is more likely to develop cervix disorders? You are more likely to develop a cervix disorder if: You've had a previous cervical procedure or surgery. You've had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia or gonorrhea . You used a latex condom or a feminine product such as a spermicide or douche that irritated the skin of your vagina. You left something in your vagina too long, such as a diaphragm, tampon, or cervical cap, and it caused irritation. You don't consistently use a condom when you have sex, or you have multiple sex partners. What are the symptoms of cervix disorders? You may not know that something is wrong since cervix disorders may not have any symptoms. If you have symptoms, they may vary based on the cervix disorder. Symptoms can include: Vaginal bleeding that's not normal for you, such as bleeding between menstrual periods Pain during sex or a pelvic exam Abnormal vaginal discharge If you are pregnant , a few signs of an incompetent cervix could include light vaginal bleeding, a feeling of pelvic pressure, or mild cramps. But you may not have any signs. How are cervix disorders diagnosed? Even if you don't have symptoms, your health care provider may notice changes to the cells of your cervix during a pelvic exam. Your provider may look for: Redness or inflammation (swelling) of your cervix or vaginal walls Vaginal discharge or strong odor Your provider may perform a Pap test to look for changes in your cervix. What are the treatments for cervix disorders? The treatment for cervix disorders depends on the cause. It might include antibiotics or stopping using a product that causes skin irritation. If you have had an incompetent cervix in the past, you might take medicine or have ultrasound imaging tests to check how your pregnancy is going. Can cervix disorders be prevented? You can take steps to prevent some cervix disorders. This can include to: Use a condom every time you have sex. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading STIs. If you or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. Have regular pelvic exams. Get tested for STIs as needed.

Cesarean Delivery,https://medlineplus.gov/cesareandelivery.html,"What is a cesarean delivery? A cesarean delivery, also called a cesarean section or c-section, is surgery to deliver a baby. The baby is taken out through your abdomen (belly). In the United States, almost one in three babies are born this way. Some cesarean deliveries are planned. Others are emergency cesarean deliveries, which are done when unexpected problems happen during delivery. When is a cesarean delivery needed? You may need a cesarean delivery because: You have health problems , including infection You are carrying more than one baby Your baby is too big Your baby is in the wrong position Your baby's health is in danger Labor is not moving along as it should There are problems with your placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to your baby) Not everyone who has had a cesarean delivery before will need another one next time. You may be able to have a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). Talk to your health care provider about what is right for you. How is a cesarean delivery done? Before the surgery, you will be given pain medicine. Depending on your circumstances, you might get: An epidural block, which numbs the lower part of the body through an injection in the spine. A spinal block, which numbs the lower part of the body through an injection directly into the spinal fluid. General anesthesia, which makes you unconscious during the surgery. This is often used during emergency cesarean deliveries. During the surgery, the surgeon will: Make a cut in your abdomen and uterus. The cut is usually horizontal, but in some cases it may be vertical. Open the amniotic sac and take out your baby. Cut the umbilical cord and the placenta. Close the uterus and abdomen with stitches that will later dissolve. What are the risks of a cesarean delivery? A cesarean delivery is relatively safe for you and your baby. But it is still a major surgery, and it carries risks. They may include: Infection Blood loss Blood clots in the legs, pelvic organs, or lungs Injury to surrounding structures, such as the bowel or bladder A reaction to the medicines or anesthesia used Some of these risks do also apply to a vaginal birth. But it does take longer to recover from a cesarean delivery than from a vaginal birth. And having a cesarean delivery can raise the risk of having difficulties with future pregnancies. The more cesarean deliveries you have, the more the risk goes up. NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development",MedlinePlus
Chagas Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/chagasdisease.html,"What is Chagas disease? Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is an illness that can cause serious heart and stomach problems. It is caused by a parasite . Chagas disease is common in Latin America, especially in poor, rural areas. It can also be found in the United States, most often in people who were infected before they moved to the U.S. What causes Chagas disease? Chagas disease is caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite. It is usually spread by infected blood-sucking bugs called triatomine bugs. They are also known as ""kissing bugs"" because they often bite people's faces. When one of these bugs bites you, it leaves behind infected waste. You can become infected if you rub the waste in your eyes or nose, the bite wound, or a cut. Chagas disease can also spread through contaminated food, a blood transfusion, a donated organ, or from the pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy. Who is more likely to develop Chagas disease? Kissing bugs can be found throughout the Americas, but they are more common in certain areas. The people who are most at risk for Chagas disease: Live in rural areas of Latin America Have seen the bugs, especially in those areas Have stayed in a house with a thatched roof or with walls that have cracks or crevices What are the symptoms of Chagas disease? In the beginning, there may be no symptoms. Some people do get mild symptoms, such as: Fever Fatigue Body aches Headache Loss of appetite Diarrhea Vomiting A rash A swollen eyelid These early symptoms usually go away.

Later, it can cause serious intestinal and heart problems such as: An  serious arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) that can cause sudden death An enlarged heart that doesn't pump blood well Problems with digestion and bowel movements An increased chance of having a stroke How is Chagas disease diagnosed? To find out if you have Chagas disease, your health care provider: Will do a physical exam Will take your medical history, including asking about your symptoms and where you have lived and traveled Will run a blood test for Chagas disease May run tests to see whether the disease has affected your intestines and heart What are the treatments for Chagas disease? Medicines can kill the parasite, especially early on. You can also treat related problems. For example, a pacemaker can help with some heart complications. Can Chagas disease be prevented? There are no vaccines or medicines to prevent Chagas disease. If you travel to areas where it occurs, you are at higher risk if you sleep outdoors or are staying in poor housing conditions.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/charcotmarietoothdisease.html,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a group of genetic nerve disorders. It is named after the three doctors who first identified it. In the United States, CMT affects about 1 in 2,500 people. CMT affects your peripheral nerves . Peripheral nerves carry movement and sensation signals between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body. Symptoms usually start around the teen years. Foot problems such as high arches or hammertoes can be early symptoms. As CMT progresses, your lower legs may weaken. Later, your hands may also become weak. Doctors diagnose CMT by doing a neurologic exam, nerve tests, genetic tests, or a nerve biopsy. There is no cure. The disease can be so mild you don't realize you have it or severe enough to make you weak. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, braces and other devices and sometimes surgery can help.

Chest Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/chestinjuriesanddisorders.html,"What is the chest? The chest is the part of your body between your neck and your abdomen (belly). The medical term for your chest is thorax. Your chest holds many important structures for breathing, digestion, blood circulation, and other important body functions. These structures include your: Ribs and breastbone Esophagus, the tube between your mouth and stomach Trachea, your windpipe Bronchi, the tubes that carry air from your windpipe to your lungs Lungs Pleura, a thin layer of tissue that covers the lungs and lines the inside wall of the chest space Heart and large blood vessels Thymus, a gland that's part of your immune system Nerves What are chest injuries and disorders? Chest injuries and disorders are problems that affect any of the organs or structures located in your chest. There are many types of chest injuries and disorders, for example: Broken ribs Esophagus disorders Swallowing disorders , also called dysphagia Tracheal disorders Bronchial disorders Lung diseases and collapsed lung Pleural disorders Heart diseases Mediastinal diseases, which are tumors, inflammation, and other problems with the structures in the mediastinum, which is the space between your lungs, breastbone, and spine Thoracic aortic aneurysm Thoracic outlet syndrome Chest injuries may happen from the force of car accidents, falls , or sports injuries . Or the chest may be pierced by a bullet or sharp object. Because your chest holds so many important structures, certain chest injuries may be life-threatening. How are chest injuries and disorders diagnosed? Diagnosis of chest injuries or disorders depends on the type of symptoms you're having and whether you've had a chest injury. Injuries are usually obvious, but in most cases, you'll need tests to know how serious an injury is. There are many types of tests for diagnosing different types of chest injuries and disorders, for example: Diagnostic imaging tests Heart tests Lung function tests Bronchoscopy Pleural fluid analysis Dysphagia tests Biopsy Treatments will depend on the type of chest injury or disorder you have.",MedlinePlus

Most cases are in children under age 15, but older children and adults can get it.  It spreads very easily from one person to another. The classic symptom of chickenpox is an uncomfortable, itchy rash. The rash turns into fluid-filled blisters and eventually into scabs. It usually shows up on the face, chest, and back and then spreads to the rest of the body. Other symptoms include: Fever Headache Tiredness Loss of appetite Chickenpox is usually mild and lasts 5 to 10 days. Calamine lotions and oatmeal baths can help with itching. Acetaminophen can treat the fever. Do not use aspirin for chickenpox; that combination can cause Reye syndrome . Chickenpox can sometimes cause serious problems. Adults, babies, teenagers, pregnant women, and those with weak immune systems tend to get sicker from it. They may need to take antiviral medicines. Once you catch chickenpox, the virus usually stays in your body.  You probably will not get chickenpox again, but the virus can cause shingles in adults.

Preterm labor can start before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. Labor happens in three stages. The first stage begins with contractions. It continues until your cervix has become thinner and dilated (stretched) to about 4 inches wide. The second stage is the active stage, in which you begin to push downward. Crowning is when your baby's scalp comes into view. Shortly afterward, your baby is born. In the third stage, you deliver the placenta.

Childhood Leukemia,https://medlineplus.gov/childhoodleukemia.html,"What is leukemia? Leukemia is a term for cancers of the blood cells. Leukemia starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job: White blood cells help your body fight infection Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs Platelets help form clots to stop bleeding When you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work. What are the types of leukemia in children? There are different types of leukemia. Some types are acute (fast growing). They usually get worse quickly if they are not treated. Most childhood leukemias are acute: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) , which is the most common type of leukemia in children and the most common cancer in children . In ALL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) , which happens when bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets. Other types of leukemia are chronic (slow growing). They usually get worse over a longer period of time. They are rare in children: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in which the bone marrow makes abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). It is more common in teens than children. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), in which the bone marrow makes abnormal granulocytes (a type of white blood cell). It is very rare in children. There are some other rare types of leukemia in children, including juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). What causes leukemia in children? Leukemia happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown. However, there are certain factors that raise the risk of childhood leukemia. Who is at risk for leukemia in children? The factors that raise the risk of childhood leukemia include: Having a brother or sister, especially a twin, with leukemia Past treatment with chemotherapy Exposure to radiation , including radiation therapy Having certain genetic conditions , such as Ataxia telangiectasia Down syndrome Fanconi anemia Li-Fraumeni syndrome Neurofibromatosis type 1 There are other factors that may raise the risk of getting one or more of the specific types of childhood leukemia. What are the symptoms of leukemia in children? Some of the symptoms of leukemia may include: Feeling tired Fever or night sweats Easy bruising or bleeding Weight loss or loss of appetite Petechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding. Other leukemia symptoms can be different from type to type. Chronic leukemia may not cause symptoms at first. How is leukemia in children diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose leukemia: A physical exam A medical history Blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) Bone marrow tests. There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing. Genetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes Once there is a diagnosis of leukemia, other tests may be done to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and a lumbar puncture, which is a procedure to collect and test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). What are the treatments for leukemia in children? The treatments for leukemia depend on which type it is, how severe the leukemia is, the child's age, and other factors. Possible treatments might include: chemotherapy radiation therapy Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells Treatment for childhood leukemia is often successful. But the treatments can cause complications right away or later in life. Children who survived leukemia will need follow-up care the rest of their lives to watch for and treat any complications they may have. NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus
Childhood Vaccines,https://medlineplus.gov/childhoodvaccines.html,"What are vaccines? Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach the immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria . Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make your child sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ. These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps the body fight off the germs. Your child's immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity. Why do I need to vaccinate my child? Babies are born with immune systems that can fight most germs, but there are some serious diseases they can't handle. That's why they need vaccines to strengthen their immune system. These diseases once killed or harmed many infants, children, and adults. But now with vaccines, your child can get immunity from these diseases without having to get sick. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would. Vaccinating your child also protects others. Normally, germs can travel quickly through a community and make a lot of people sick. If enough people get sick, it can lead to an outbreak. But when enough people are vaccinated against a certain disease, it's harder for that disease to spread to others. The entire community is less likely to get the disease. This is called ""community immunity."" Community immunity is especially important for the people who can't get certain vaccines. For example, they may not be able to get a vaccine because they have weakened immune systems. Others may be allergic to certain vaccine ingredients. And newborn babies are too young to get some vaccines. Community immunity can help to protect them all. Are vaccines safe for children? Vaccines are safe . They must go through extensive safety testing and evaluation before they are approved in the United States. Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and autism. Can vaccines overload my child's immune system? No, vaccines do not overload the immune system. Every day, a healthy child's immune system successfully fights off thousands of germs. When your child gets vaccines, they are getting weakened or dead germs. So even if they get several vaccines in one day, they are being exposed to a tiny amount of germs compared to what they encounter every day in their environment. When do I need to vaccinate my child? Your child will get vaccines during well-child visits . They will be given according to the vaccine schedule. This schedule lists which vaccines are recommended for children. It includes who should get the vaccines, how many doses they need, and at what age they should get them. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes the vaccine schedule. Following the vaccine schedule allows your child to get protection from the diseases at exactly the right time. It gives their body the chance to build up immunity before being exposed to these very serious diseases.",MedlinePlus

Chlamydia Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/chlamydiainfections.html,"What is chlamydia? Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI). It is caused by bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis . Anyone can get chlamydia. It often doesn't cause symptoms, so people may not know that they have it. Antibiotics can cure it. But if it's not treated, chlamydia can cause serious health problems. How is chlamydia spread? You can get chlamydia during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with someone who has chlamydia. Chlamydia can also be passed to the baby during childbirth . If you've had chlamydia and were treated in the past, you can get re-infected if you have unprotected sex with someone who has it. Who is more likely to get chlamydia? Chlamydia is more common in young people, especially young women. You are more likely to get infected with chlamydia if you don't consistently use a condom or if you have multiple partners. What are the symptoms of chlamydia? Chlamydia doesn't usually cause any symptoms. So you may not realize that you have it. But even if you don't have symptoms, you can still pass the infection to others. If you do have symptoms, they may not appear until several weeks after you have sex with someone who has chlamydia. Symptoms in women include: Abnormal vaginal discharge, which may have a strong smell A burning sensation when urinating If the infection spreads, you might get lower abdominal (belly) pain , pain during sex, nausea , and fever . Symptoms in men include: Discharge from your penis A burning sensation when urinating (peeing) Pain and swelling in one or both testicles (although this is less common) If the chlamydia infects the rectum (in men or women), it can cause rectal pain, discharge, and bleeding. How is chlamydia diagnosed? There are lab tests to diagnose chlamydia. Your health care provider may ask you to provide a urine sample. Or your provider may use (or ask you to use) a cotton swab to get a sample from your vagina to test for chlamydia. Who should be tested for chlamydia? You should go to your provider for a test if you have symptoms of chlamydia or if you have a partner who has an STI. If you are pregnant, you should get a test when you go to your first prenatal visit . People at higher risk should get checked for chlamydia every year: Sexually active women 25 and younger Older women who have new or multiple sex partners or a sex partner who has an STI Men who have sex with men (MSM) What other problems can chlamydia cause? In women, an untreated infection can spread to your uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause permanent damage to your reproductive system. This can lead to long-term pelvic pain , infertility , and ectopic pregnancy . Women who have had chlamydia infections more than once are at higher risk of serious reproductive health complications. Men often don't have health problems from chlamydia. Sometimes it can infect the epididymis (the tube that carries sperm). This can cause pain, fever, and, rarely, infertility . Both men and women can develop reactive arthritis because of a chlamydia infection. Reactive arthritis is a type of arthritis that happens as a ""reaction"" to an infection in the body. Babies born to infected mothers can get eye infections and pneumonia from chlamydia. It may also make it more likely for your baby to be born too early . Untreated chlamydia may also increase your chances of getting or giving HIV . What are the treatments for chlamydia? Antibiotics will cure the infection. You may get a one-time dose of the antibiotics, or you may need to take medicine every day for 7 days. It is important to take all the medicine that your provider prescribed for you. Antibiotics cannot repair any permanent damage that the disease has caused. To prevent spreading the disease to your partner, you should not have sex until the infection has cleared up. If you got a one-time dose of antibiotics, you should wait 7 days after taking the medicine to have sex again. If you have to take medicine every day for 7 days, you should not have sex again until you have finished taking all of the doses of your medicine. It is common to get a repeat infection, so you need to get tested again about three months after treatment. Can chlamydia be prevented? The only sure way to prevent chlamydia is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading chlamydia. If your or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus

You may get it if you travel to parts of the world with poor water and sewage treatment. Outbreaks can also happen after disasters. The disease is not likely to spread directly from person to person. Cholera infections are often mild. Some people don't have any symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they usually start 2 to 3 days after infection. The most common symptom is watery diarrhea. In some cases, the infection can be severe, causing  lots of watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. Because you quickly lose body fluids, you are at risk for dehydration and shock . Without treatment, you could die within hours. If you think that you might have cholera, you should get medical care right away. Doctors diagnose cholera with a stool sample or rectal swab. Treatment is the replacement of the fluid and salts that you lost through the diarrhea. This is usually with a rehydration solution that you drink. People with severe cases may need an I.V. to replace the fluids. Some of them may also need antibiotics . Most people who get fluid replacement right away will recover. There are vaccines to prevent cholera. One of them is available for adults in the U.S. Very few Americans need it, because most people do not visit areas that have an active cholera outbreak. There are also simple steps you can take to help to prevent cholera infection: Use only bottled or purified water for drinking, washing dishes, making ice cubes, and brushing your teeth If you do use tap water, boil it or use iodine tablets Wash your hands often with soap and clean water Make sure that the cooked food you eat is fully cooked and served hot Avoid unwashed or unpeeled raw fruits and vegetables Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus
Cholesterol,https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterol.html,"What is cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones , vitamin D , and substances that help you digest foods. Your body makes all the cholesterol it needs. Cholesterol is also found in foods from animal sources, such as egg yolks, meat, and cheese. If you have too much cholesterol in your blood, it can combine with other substances in the blood to form plaque. Plaque sticks to the walls of your arteries. This buildup of plaque is known as atherosclerosis . It can lead to coronary artery disease , a condition in which your coronary arteries become narrow or even blocked. What are HDL, LDL, and VLDL? HDL, LDL, and VLDL are lipoproteins. They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein. The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. Different types of lipoproteins have different purposes: HDL stands for high-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called ""good"" cholesterol because it helps your body get rid of cholesterol.  It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body. LDL stands for low-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called ""bad"" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. VLDL stands for very low-density lipoprotein. Some people also call VLDL a ""bad"" cholesterol because it too contributes to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. But VLDL and LDL are different; VLDL mainly carries triglycerides and LDL mainly carries cholesterol. What causes high cholesterol? The most common cause of high cholesterol is an unhealthy lifestyle. This can include: Unhealthy eating habits, such as eating lots of saturated fats . These fats are found in red meats, full-fat dairy products, chocolate, some baked goods, and many deep-fried and processed foods.  Eating too much saturated fat can raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol. Lack of physical activity , with lots of sitting and little exercise. This lowers your HDL (good) cholesterol. Smoking , which lowers HDL cholesterol, especially in women. It also raises your LDL cholesterol. Stress , which may raise levels of certain hormones such as corticosteroids. These can cause your body to make more cholesterol. Drinking too much alcohol , which can raise your total cholesterol level. Genetics may also cause people to have high cholesterol. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition that causes very high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Other medical conditions and certain medicines may also raise LDL cholesterol levels or lower HDL cholesterol levels. What can raise my risk of high cholesterol? A variety of things can raise your risk of high cholesterol: Age. Your cholesterol levels tend to rise as you get older. Even though it is less common, younger people, including children and teens , can also have high cholesterol. Sex. Between ages 20 and 39, men have a greater risk of high total cholesterol than women. But after menopause , a woman's risk goes up. This happens because menopause lowers levels of female hormones that may protect against high blood cholesterol. Family history. High blood cholesterol can run in families. Other health conditions. Conditions such as diabetes , chronic kidney disease , HIV , and lupus can raise your risk of high cholesterol. Medicines. Certain medicines can raise your level of LDL cholesterol or lower your level of HDL cholesterol, including: Steroids Some chemotherapy medicines Medicines taken after an organ transplant Medicines for certain heart conditions Certain acne medicines Race or ethnicity. People from certain racial or ethnic groups may have an increased risk of high cholesterol. For example, Asian Americans are more likely to have high levels of LDL cholesterol than other groups. And non-Hispanic White people are more likely than other groups to have high levels of total cholesterol. Weight. Being overweight or having obesity raises your cholesterol level. What other health problems can high cholesterol cause? Undiagnosed or untreated high blood cholesterol can lead to serious health problems: If you have large deposits of plaque in your arteries, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). This can cause a blood clot to form on the surface of the plaque. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow in a coronary artery. If the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, it can cause angina (chest pain) or a heart attack . Plaque also can build up in other arteries in your body, including the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your brain and limbs. This can lead to problems such as carotid artery disease , stroke , and peripheral arterial disease . How is high cholesterol diagnosed? There are usually no signs or symptoms that you have high cholesterol. A blood test can measure your cholesterol levels . When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history.  The general recommendations are: For people who are age 19 or younger: : The first test should be between ages 9 to 11 Children should have the test again every 5 years Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke For people who are ages 20 to 65: : Younger adults should have the test every 5 years Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years For people over age 65: They should be tested every year How can I lower my cholesterol? You can lower your cholesterol through heart-healthy lifestyle changes. They include a heart-healthy eating plan , weight management , and regular physical activity . If the lifestyle changes alone do not lower your cholesterol enough, you may also need to take medicines. There are several types of cholesterol-lowering medicines available, including statins . If you take medicines to lower your cholesterol, you still should continue with the lifestyle changes. Some people with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) may receive a treatment called lipoprotein apheresis. This treatment uses a filtering machine to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood. Then the machine returns the rest of the blood back to the person. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Cholesterol Levels: What You Need to Know,https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterollevelswhatyouneedtoknow.html,"What is cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that that's found in all the cells in your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly.  But if you have too much of it in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk of coronary artery disease and other heart diseases . How do you measure cholesterol levels? A blood test called a lipoprotein or lipid panel can measure your cholesterol levels. Before the test, you'll need to fast (not eat or drink anything but water) for 9 to 12 hours. The test gives information about your: Total cholesterol . This is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood. It includes both low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol. LDL cholesterol. LDL is often called ""bad"" cholesterol because it is the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockage in the arteries. HDL cholesterol. HDL is often called ""good"" cholesterol because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. Non-HDL. This number is your total cholesterol minus your HDL. Your non-HDL includes LDL and other types of cholesterol such as VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein). Triglycerides . This is another type of fat in your blood that can raise the risk of heart disease, especially in women . What do my cholesterol numbers mean? Cholesterol numbers are measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Talk with your healthcare provider about what your cholesterol numbers should be. The numbers that are best for you may depend on your age, race, blood pressure, weight, family history, and more. However, here are some general guidelines showing the desirable levels (levels that are healthy for most people): Anyone age 19 or younger: Type of Cholesterol Healthy Level Total Cholesterol Less than 170 mg/dL Non-HDL Less than 120 mg/dL LDL Less than 110 mg/dL HDL More than 45 mg/dL Men age 20 or older: Type of Cholesterol Healthy Level Total Cholesterol Less than 200 mg/dL Non-HDL Less than 130 mg/dL LDL Less than 100 mg/dL HDL Greater than or equal to 60 mg/dL is best. Levels less than 40 mg/dL are considered low. Women age 20 or older: Type of Cholesterol Healthy Level Total Cholesterol Less than 200 mg/dL Non-HDL Less than 130 mg/dL LDL Less than 100 mg/dL HDL Greater than or equal to 60 mg/dL is best. Levels less than 50 mg/dL are considered low. Triglycerides are not a type of cholesterol, but they are also measured in this test. A normal triglyceride level is below 150 mg/dL. You might need treatment if you have triglyceride levels that are borderline high (150-199 mg/dL) or high (200 mg/dL or more). How often should I get a cholesterol test? When and how often you should get a cholesterol test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are: For people who are age 19 or younger : The first test should be between ages 9 to 11 Children should have the test again every 5 years Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke For people who are ages 20 to 65 : Younger adults should have the test every 5 years Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years For people older than 65: : They should be tested every year What affects my cholesterol levels? Many factors can affect your cholesterol levels. Some of them are things you can change: Diet. Saturated fat and cholesterol in the food you eat make your blood cholesterol level rise. Saturated fat is the main problem, but cholesterol in foods also matters. Reducing the amount of saturated fat in your diet helps lower your blood cholesterol level. Foods that have high levels of saturated fats include red meats, full-fat dairy products, chocolate, some baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods. Weight. Being overweight or having obesity are risk factors for heart disease. They also tend to increase your cholesterol Lack of physical activity . Not being physically active is a risk factor for heart disease. Smoking . Cigarette smoking lowers your HDL cholesterol. Since HDL helps to remove cholesterol from your arteries, having a lower HDL level can contribute to a higher cholesterol level. Some factors that you cannot change can also affect cholesterol levels, such as: Age. Your cholesterol levels tend to rise as you get older. Even though it is less common, younger people, including children and teens , can also have high cholesterol. Sex. Between ages 20 and 39, men have a greater risk of high total cholesterol than women. But after menopause , a woman's risk goes up. This happens because menopause lowers levels of female hormones that may protect against high blood cholesterol. Family history. Your genes partly determine how much cholesterol your body makes. High cholesterol can run in families. Race or ethnicity. People from certain racial or ethnic groups may have an increased risk of high cholesterol. For example, Asian Americans are more likely to have high levels of LDL cholesterol than other groups. And non-Hispanic White people are more likely than other groups to have high levels of total cholesterol. How can I lower my cholesterol?

Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly.  But if you have too much of it in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases . Cholesterol is made by your liver. It travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type of lipoprotein, LDL , is sometimes called the ""bad"" cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Another type, HDL , is sometimes called the ""good"" cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Then your liver removes the cholesterol from your body. What are the treatments for high cholesterol? If you have high cholesterol, lifestyle changes can help you lower your cholesterol levels . But sometimes the lifestyle changes are not enough, and you need to take cholesterol medicines. But you should still continue with the lifestyle changes even though you are taking medicines. Who needs cholesterol medicines? Your health care provider may prescribe cholesterol medicines for you if: You have already had a heart attack or stroke , or you have peripheral arterial disease Your LDL (bad) cholesterol level is 190 mg/dL or higher You are 40-75 years old, you have diabetes, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher You are 40-75 years old, you have a high risk of developing heart disease or stroke, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher What are the different types of cholesterol medicines? There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including: Statins . They reduce the amount of cholesterol made in the liver. They also increase your liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol that is already in the blood. Statins are the most common medicines used to treat high cholesterol. Bile acid sequestrants. They keep bile acids, which digest fats and oils, from being absorbed into the body.  But your body needs bile acids, so your liver will make more of them. It makes them by breaking down LDL cholesterol, so this helps lower your LDL cholesterol. Your provider may prescribe these medicines if you cannot take statins or if statins alone are not lowering your cholesterol enough. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors. They block how cholesterol is absorbed into the body. They are also used if you cannot take statins or if statins alone are not lowering your cholesterol enough. Nicotinic acid (niacin). It is a type of B vitamin . It reduces the amount of fats made by your liver, so it lowers your LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Niacin also raises HDL cholesterol. Even though you can buy niacin without a prescription, you should talk to your provider before taking it to lower your cholesterol. High doses of niacin can cause serious side effects . PCSK9 inhibitors. These are medicines that you inject under your skin. They block a protein called PCSK9. This helps your liver remove and clear LDL cholesterol from your blood. Your provider may prescribe a PCSK9 inhibitor and a statin if you are at high risk of complications like heart attack or stroke, or if you have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). FH is an inherited disorder that causes very high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Fibrates. They lower triglycerides in several complex ways, including reducing the amount of triglycerides made by the liver. They may also help increase HDL cholesterol and may lower LDL levels a bit. If you take them with statins, it might increase the risk of side effects. Combination medicines. They include more than one type of cholesterol-lowering medicine. There are also combination medicines that can treat both high blood pressure and cholesterol. There are also a few other cholesterol medicines (lomitapide and mipomersen) that are only for people who have FH. How does my health care provider decide which cholesterol medicine I should take? When deciding which medicine you should take and which dose you need, your provider will consider: Your cholesterol levels. Your risk for heart disease and stroke. Your age. Any other health problems you have. Possible side effects of the medicines. Higher doses are more likely to cause side effects, especially over time. Medicines can help control your cholesterol, but they don't cure it.

Chronic Bronchitis,https://medlineplus.gov/chronicbronchitis.html,"What is chronic bronchitis? Chronic bronchitis is a type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. The other main type of COPD is emphysema . Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person. Chronic bronchitis is inflammation (swelling) and irritation of the bronchial tubes. These tubes are the airways that carry air to and from the air sacs in your lungs. The irritation of the tubes causes mucus to build up. This mucus and the swelling of the tubes make it harder for your lungs to move oxygen in and carbon dioxide out of your body. What causes chronic bronchitis? The cause of chronic bronchitis is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause chronic bronchitis, especially if you inhale them. Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to chronic bronchitis. These include secondhand smoke , air pollution , and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace. Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing chronic bronchitis. Who is at risk for chronic bronchitis? The risk factors for chronic bronchitis include: Smoking. This the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have chronic bronchitis smoke or used to smoke. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants , such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace. Age. Most people who have chronic bronchitis are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin. Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get chronic bronchitis are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD. What are the symptoms of chronic bronchitis? At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include: Frequent coughing or a cough that produces a lot mucus Wheezing A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity Tightness in your chest Some people with chronic bronchitis get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu . In severe cases, chronic bronchitis can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs. How is chronic bronchitis diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A family history Various tests, such as lung function tests , a chest x-ray or CT scan , and blood tests What are the treatments for chronic bronchitis? There is no cure for chronic bronchitis. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include: Lifestyle changes , such as Quitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat chronic bronchitis. Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants Ask your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness. Medicines , such as Bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation. Vaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with chronic bronchitis are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases. Antibiotics if you get a bacterial or viral lung infection Oxygen therapy , if you have severe chronic bronchitis and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times. Pulmonary rehabilitation , which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include An exercise program Disease management training Nutritional counseling Psychological counseling A lung transplant , as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines If you have chronic bronchitis, it's important to know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. Call your health care provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever . Can chronic bronchitis be prevented? Since smoking causes most cases of chronic bronchitis, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke. It's also important to try to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, and dusts. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Chronic Kidney Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/chronickidneydisease.html,"You have two kidneys, each about the size of your fist.  Their main job is to filter your blood. They remove wastes and extra water, which become urine. They also keep the body's chemicals balanced, help control blood pressure, and make hormones. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means that your kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood as they should. This damage can cause wastes to build up in your body. It can also cause other problems that can harm your health. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes of CKD. The kidney damage occurs slowly over many years. Many people don't have any symptoms until their kidney disease is very advanced. Blood and urine tests are the only way to know if you have kidney disease. Treatments cannot cure kidney disease, but they may slow kidney disease. They include medicines to lower blood pressure , control blood sugar , and lower cholesterol . CKD may still get worse over time. Sometimes it can lead to kidney failure . If your kidneys fail, you will need dialysis or a kidney transplantation . You can take steps to keep your kidneys healthier longer: Choose foods with less salt (sodium) Control your blood pressure ; your health care provider can tell you what your blood pressure should be Keep your blood sugar in the target range, if you have diabetes Limit the amount of alcohol you drink Choose foods that are healthy for your heart: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy foods Lose weight if you are overweight Be physically active Don't smoke NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",MedlinePlus
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,https://medlineplus.gov/chroniclymphocyticleukemia.html,"What is leukemia? Leukemia is a term for cancers of the blood cells. Leukemia starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job: White blood cells help your body fight infection Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs Platelets help form clots to stop bleeding When you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work. What is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)? Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of chronic leukemia. ""Chronic"" means that the leukemia usually gets worse slowly. In CLL, the bone marrow makes abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). When the abnormal cells crowd out the healthy cells, it can lead to infection, anemia , and easy bleeding . The abnormal cells can also spread outside the blood to other parts of the body.
CLL is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults. It often occurs during or after middle age. It is rare in children . What causes chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)? CLL happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown, so it's hard to predict who might get CLL. There are a few factors that might raise your risk. Who is at risk for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)? It is hard to predict who will get CLL. There are a few factors that could raise your risk: Age - your risk goes up as you get older. Most people who are diagnosed with CLL are over 50. Family history of CLL and other blood and bone marrow diseases Racial/ethnic group - CLL is more common in whites than in people from other racial or ethnic groups Exposure to certain chemicals, including Agent Orange, a chemical that was used in the Vietnam War What are the symptoms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)? In the beginning, CLL does not cause any symptoms. Later, you can have symptoms such as: Swollen lymph nodes - you may notice them as painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin Weakness or feeling tired Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs Fever and infection Easy bruising or bleeding Petechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding. Weight loss for no known reason Drenching night sweats How is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose CLL: A physical exam A medical history Blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and blood chemistry tests. Blood chemistry tests measure different substances in the blood, including electrolytes, fats, proteins, glucose (sugar), and enzymes. Specific blood chemistry tests include a basic metabolic panel (BMP) , a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) , kidney function tests , liver function tests , and an electrolyte panel . Flow cytometry tests, which check for leukemia cells and identify which type of leukemia it is. The tests can be done on blood, bone marrow, or other tissue. Genetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes If you are diagnosed with CLL, you may have additional tests to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and bone marrow tests . What are the treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)? Treatments for CLL include: Watchful waiting, which means that you don't get treatment right away. Your health care provider regularly checks to see if your signs or symptoms appear or change. Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Immunotherapy Chemotherapy with bone marrow or stem cell transplant The goals of treatment are to slow the growth of the leukemia cells and to give you long periods of remission. Remission means that the signs and symptoms of cancer are reduced or have disappeared. The CLL may come back after remission, and you may need more treatment.

When the abnormal cells crowd out the healthy cells, it can lead to infection, anemia , and easy bleeding . The abnormal cells can also spread outside the blood to other parts of the body. CML usually occurs in adults during or after middle age. It is rare in children . What causes chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)? Most people with CML have a genetic change called the Philadelphia chromosome. It's called that because researchers in Philadelphia discovered it. People normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell. These chromosomes contain your DNA (genetic material). In CML, part of the DNA from one chromosome moves to another chromosome. It combines with some DNA there, which creates a new gene called BCR-ABL. This gene causes your bone marrow to make an abnormal protein. This protein allows the leukemia cells to grow out of control. The Philadelphia chromosome isn't passed from parent to child. It happens during your lifetime. The cause is unknown. Who is at risk for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)? It is hard to predict who will get CML. There are a few factors that could raise your risk: Age - your risk goes up as you get older CML is slightly more common in men Exposure to high-dose radiation What are the symptoms of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)? Sometimes CML does not cause symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they can include: Feeling very tired Weight loss for no known reason Drenching night sweats Fever Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side How is chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose CML: A physical exam A medical history Blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and blood chemistry tests.

Genetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes, including tests to look for the Philadelphia chromosome If you are diagnosed with CML, you may have additional tests such as imaging tests to see whether the cancer has spread. What are the phases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)? CML has three phases. The phases are based on how much the CML has grown or spread: Chronic phase, where less than 10% of cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells (leukemia cells). Most people are diagnosed in this phase, and many do not have symptoms. Standard treatment usually helps in this phase. Accelerated phase, 10% to 19% of the cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells. In this phase, people often have symptoms and standard treatment may not be as effective as in the chronic phase. Blastic phase, where 20% or more of the cells in the blood or bone marrow are blast cells. The blast cells have spread to other tissues and organs. If you have tiredness, fever, and an enlarged spleen during the blastic phase, it is called a blast crisis. This phase is harder to treat. What are the treatments for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)? There are several different treatments for CML: Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. For CML, the drugs are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). They block tyrosine kinase, which is an enzyme that causes your bone marrow to make too many blasts. Chemotherapy Immunotherapy High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). DLI is a treatment that may be used after a stem cell transplant. It involves giving you an infusion (into your bloodstream) of healthy lymphocytes from the stem cell transplant donor. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell. These donor lymphocytes may kill the remaining cancer cells. Surgery to remove the spleen (splenectomy) Which treatments you get will depend on which phase you are in, your age, your overall health, and other factors. When the signs and symptoms of CML are reduced or have disappeared, it is called remission. The CML may come back after remission, and you may need more treatment.

Chronic Pain,https://medlineplus.gov/chronicpain.html,"What is chronic pain? Pain is a signal from your nervous system that something may be wrong. It is an unpleasant feeling, such as a prick, tingle, sting, burn, or ache. Pain may be sharp or dull. You may feel pain in one area of your body or all over. Each person feels pain differently, even if the reason for the pain is the same. Pain might be acute or chronic. The type of pain is based on how long and how often you have pain. Acute pain starts suddenly and goes away when the cause is treated or healed. This pain lets you know that you may be injured or have a problem you need to take care of. Chronic pain lasts longer than three months or the time in which you should have healed. If you have chronic pain, it can occur most days or every day and may last for weeks, months, or even years. It can affect all aspects of daily life, including your mood and relationships. Treatment may not get rid of chronic pain, but it can help with your symptoms. What causes chronic pain? Sometimes, acute pain can become chronic pain. The original cause may have been an injury or infection, or you may have an ongoing cause of pain, such as arthritis or cancer . In some cases, there is no clear cause. Environmental factors and psychological factors such as mood and stress can make chronic pain worse. What are the symptoms of chronic pain? Since people feel pain in different ways, two people could have the same issue, but each may have different symptoms. Chronic pain can occur anywhere in your body and may cause other symptoms such as fatigue , mood changes, or difficulty sleeping . If you have depression or stress, it may make chronic pain worse.

Circumcision,https://medlineplus.gov/circumcision.html,"What is circumcision? Circumcision is a surgical procedure to remove the foreskin from the penis. The foreskin is the loose skin that covers the tip of the penis. In the United States, circumcision is often done before a new baby leaves the hospital. What should I consider when deciding whether to have my baby circumcised? As parents, it is your decision whether to have your baby circumcised. When making your decision, you should consider your own religious, cultural, and personal preferences, as well as the medical benefits and risks. You can discuss these with your baby's health care provider before you make a decision. What are the medical benefits of circumcision? The possible medical benefits of circumcision include: A lower risk of HIV and some other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A slightly lower risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs) during the first year of life and penile cancer later in life. However, these conditions are rare in all males (circumcised or not). Prevention of certain penile problems, such as foreskin infections and phimosis, a condition in which the foreskin can't be retracted (pulled back). Easier hygiene. What are the risks of circumcision? The risks of circumcision include: A low risk of bleeding, infection, or scarring. A very low risk of having too much or not enough skin cut off. Pain. You can ask the health care provider to put a numbing medicine on your baby's penis to lessen the pain. These risks are higher when circumcision is performed on older babies, boys, and men. What else do I need to know about circumcision? Premature babies and babies born with health problems should not be circumcised until they are healthy. If have your baby circumcised, ask their provider how to care for the penis as it heals. If your baby does not get circumcised, their provider can teach you how to keep your baby's penis clean.

Cirrhosis,https://medlineplus.gov/cirrhosis.html,"Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver. Scar tissue forms because of injury or long-term disease. Scar tissue cannot do what healthy liver tissue does - make protein, help fight infections, clean the blood, help digest food and store energy.   Cirrhosis can lead to  : Easy bruising or bleeding, or nosebleeds Swelling of the abdomen or legs Extra sensitivity to medicines High blood pressure in the vein entering the liver Enlarged veins called varices in the esophagus and stomach. Varices can bleed suddenly. Kidney failure Jaundice Severe itching Gallstones A small number of people with cirrhosis get liver cancer . Your doctor will diagnose cirrhosis with blood tests, imaging tests, or a biopsy. Cirrhosis has many causes. In the United States, the most common causes are chronic alcoholism and hepatitis . Nothing will make the scar tissue disappear, but treating the cause can keep it from getting worse. If too much scar tissue forms, you may need to consider a liver transplant .

"Cleaning, Disinfecting, and Sanitizing",https://medlineplus.gov/cleaningdisinfectingandsanitizing.html,"Where are germs found? Germs are a part of everyday life. Some of them are helpful, but others are harmful and cause disease. They can be found everywhere - in our air, soil, and water. They are on our skin and in our bodies. Germs are also on the surfaces and objects that we touch. Sometimes those germs can spread to you and make you sick. For example, there could be germs on a tv remote. You could get infected with the germs if you touch the remote and then rub your eyes or nose or eat with your hands. How can I avoid getting germs from surfaces and objects? To avoid becoming infected by germs from surfaces and objects, it is important to wash your hands often . But you can't wash your hands every time you touch something. So it's also important to regularly clean and disinfect surfaces and objects. What is the difference between cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting? Some people think that disinfecting is same thing as cleaning or sanitizing. But they are actually different: Cleaning removes dirt, dust, crumbs, and germs from surfaces or objects. When you clean, you will likely use soap (or detergent) and water to physically clean off the surfaces and objects. This may not necessarily kill the germs. But since you removed some of them, there are fewer germs that could spread infection to you. Disinfecting uses chemicals (disinfectants) to kill germs on surfaces and objects. Some common disinfectants are bleach and alcohol solutions. You usually need to leave the disinfectant on the surfaces and objects for a certain period of time to kill the germs. Disinfecting does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs. Sanitizing could be done by either cleaning, disinfecting, or both. Sanitizing means that you are lowering the number of germs to a safe level. What is considered a safe level depends on public health standards or requirements at a workplace, school, etc. For example, there are sanitizing procedures for restaurants and other facilities that prepare food. What you do to sanitize will vary, depending on your needs. You might be mopping a floor using a mop, a chemical, and water. You might use a dishwasher to sanitize the dishes. Or you could be using an antibacterial wipe on a tv remote. If you both clean and disinfect a surface or object, you can further lower the risk of spreading infection. There are products that clean and disinfect at the same time. Which surfaces and objects do I need to clean and disinfect? To prevent the spread of infection, you should regularly clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are touched often. For example, in your house, this would include countertops, doorknobs, faucet and toilet handles, light switches, remotes, and toys. How can I safely clean and disinfect? It's important to be safe when using cleaning and disinfecting products: Store them in the containers they came in. Always follow the instructions and pay attention to the warnings on the label. Do not mix cleaners and disinfectants unless the labels say that it is safe to do so. Combining certain products (such as chlorine bleach and ammonia cleaners) can cause serious injury or even death. Check the label to see whether you need to use gloves to protect your hands and/or eye protection when using the products If you swallow, inhale, or get them on your skin , follow the directions on the label or get medical help Store them out of the reach of children",MedlinePlus
Cleft Lip and Palate,https://medlineplus.gov/cleftlipandpalate.html,"Cleft lip and cleft palate are birth defects that occur when a baby's lip or mouth do not form properly.  They happen early during pregnancy. A baby can have a cleft lip, a cleft palate, or both. A cleft lip happens if the tissue that makes up the lip does not join completely before birth. This causes an opening in the upper lip. The opening can be a small slit or a large opening that goes through the lip into the nose. It can be on one or both sides of the lip or, rarely, in the middle of the lip. Children with a cleft lip also can have a cleft palate. The roof of the mouth is called the ""palate."" With a cleft palate, the tissue that makes up the roof of the mouth does not join correctly.  Babies may have both the front and back parts of the palate open, or they may have only one part open. Children with a cleft lip or a cleft palate often have problems with feeding and talking. They also might have ear infections, hearing loss, and problems with their teeth. Often, surgery can close the lip and palate. Cleft lip surgery is usually done before age 12 months, and cleft palate surgery is done before 18 months. Many children have other complications. They may need additional surgeries, dental and orthodontic care, and speech therapy as they get older. With treatment, most children with clefts do well and lead a healthy life.

Cocaine,https://medlineplus.gov/cocaine.html,"What is cocaine? Cocaine is a very addictive drug that is made from leaves of the coca plant found in South America. It is mostly available as an illegal drug that some people use to get high. In rare cases, it is also used as a prescription drug for for anesthesia during certain surgeries. As a street (illegal) drug, cocaine is usually a fine, white, crystal powder. Street dealers sometimes mix it with cornstarch, talcum powder, or flour to make it look like they have more cocaine. That way they can make more money. They may also mix it with other illegal drugs. Another form of the drug is crack cocaine. Crack cocaine has been heated to make it into a rock crystal. How do people use cocaine? People snort cocaine powder through the nose or rub it into their gums. Others dissolve the powder and inject it into the bloodstream. Some people inject a combination of cocaine and heroin , called a ""speedball."" Crack cocaine is smoked. What are the short-term effects of cocaine? Cocaine is a stimulant that can make people feel like they have more energy and are extra alert. But it can also make people feel restless, irritable, anxious, and paranoid. Large amounts of cocaine can lead to bizarre, unpredictable, and violent behavior. Cocaine's effects appear almost immediately and disappear within a few minutes to an hour. How long the effects last and how intense they are will depend on how the person used it. In some cases, cocaine can cause very serious health problems such as a heart attack , stroke , or coma . What are the long-term effects of cocaine? People who use cocaine over the long term may develop health problems. Which problems they have will depend on how they used the cocaine: Snorting it can lead to a loss of sense of smell , nosebleeds, nasal damage, and trouble swallowing . Smoking it can cause a cough , asthma , trouble breathing , and a higher risk of infections like pneumonia . Injecting it with a needle can lead to skin or soft tissue infections, as well as scarring . It can cause collapsed veins. When a vein collapses, the blood cannot flow through it. Injecting cocaine also puts a person at higher risk of getting diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C . Other long-term effects of cocaine use may include malnutrition and movement disorders , including Parkinson's disease . Repeated use of cocaine can lead to tolerance. This means users need more and more of the drug to have the same effect. At higher doses over time, the body becomes dependent on cocaine. If someone who is dependent on cocaine stops using it, they will have withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms can include: Depression Restlessness Fatigue Increased appetite Bad dreams and insomnia Slowed thinking Repeated use of cocaine can also lead to cocaine use disorder, also called addiction. This is more than physical dependence. It's a chronic (long-lasting) brain disorder. When someone has it, they continue to use cocaine even though it causes problems in their life. Some examples include health problems and not being able to meet responsibilities at work, school, or home. Getting and using cocaine becomes their main purpose in life. Can a person overdose on cocaine? It's possible to overdose on cocaine. This happens when a person uses so much cocaine that it causes a life-threatening reaction or death. Some people use cocaine along with other drugs or alcohol. This can increase the risk of an overdose. A cocaine overdose can cause health problems such as: Stroke Seizures irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) Heart attack There is no specific medicine to treat an overdose. Health care providers will focus on treating the specific health problems caused by the overdose. What are the treatments for cocaine use disorder?

Colonoscopy,https://medlineplus.gov/colonoscopy.html,"What are colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy? Colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy are procedures that let your doctor look inside your rectum and colon (large intestine). They use instruments called scopes. Scopes have a light and a tiny camera attached to a long, thin tube. These procedures let your doctor see problems such as inflamed tissue, ulcers, polyps , and cancer . Colonoscopy checks your entire colon and rectum. Flexible sigmoidoscopy checks the rectum and the lower colon (sigmoid colon) only. What is a virtual colonoscopy? A virtual colonoscopy also looks inside your rectum and part of your colon. But it does not use a scope. Instead, it is an x-ray test. Another name for this test is CT colonography. Who needs a colonoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, or flexible sigmoidoscopy? You may need a colonoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, or flexible sigmoidoscopy to find the cause of unexplained symptoms such as: Bleeding from your anus (the opening of the rectum through which stool passes out of your body) Changes in your bowel activity, such as diarrhea Pain in your abdomen (belly) Unexplained weight loss Doctors also use these procedures to screen for colon polyps and cancer. Screening is testing for diseases when you have no symptoms. It may find diseases at an early stage, when they are easier to treat. If aren't at higher risk for colorectal cancer, your health care provider will likely recommend you start getting screenings at age 45. If you are at higher risk, you may need to start getting screened for colorectal cancer earlier. There are also other tests to screen for colorectal cancer , including stool tests. Talk with your provider about which test is right for you and when and how often you should get it. How do you prepare for a colonoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, or flexible sigmoidoscopy? To prepare for a colonoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, or flexible sigmoidoscopy, you will need to: Talk with your doctor about any health problems you have and all of the medicines and supplements that you take. You may need to stop taking some of your medicines and/or supplements before the procedure. Follow the bowel prep instructions from your doctor. The bowel prep clears the stool out of your colon, so your doctor will be able to see the colon during the procedure: You may need to follow a clear liquid diet, usually for about one day before the procedure. Avoid red or purple drinks or gelatin; the dye can look like blood in the colon. You probably need to stop eating and drinking the night before the exam. You will need to take some laxatives. They may be pills, a powder that you dissolve in liquid, an enema, or a combination of these. The laxative will cause diarrhea, so you need to stay close to the bathroom. For a virtual colonoscopy, you will also need to drink a contrast medium the night before. The contrast medium is a dye or other substance that is visible on x-rays. It can help your doctor tell the difference between stool and polyps. How are colonoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, and flexible sigmoidoscopy done? For a colonoscopy: You will have the procedure at a hospital or outpatient center. It usually takes 30 to 60 minutes. You will get IV (intravenous) sedatives or anesthesia, usually along with pain medicine, so you won't be awake or feel pain during the procedure. You'll lie on a table while the doctor inserts a colonoscope through your anus and into your rectum and colon. The scope inflates your large intestine with air for a better view. The camera sends a video image to a monitor so your doctor can see your colon. Once the scope reaches the opening to your small intestine, the doctor will slowly remove the scope. While doing so, your doctor will examine your colon again. If you have polyps, your doctor may remove them and send them to a lab for testing. Most polyps aren't cancer, but removing them can prevent them from becoming cancer later on. If you have abnormal tissue, your doctor may do a biopsy . The sedative or anesthesia takes time to wear off completely. You'll stay at the hospital or outpatient center for 1 to 2 hours after the procedure. Then you will need someone to drive you home. For a virtual colonoscopy: You will have the procedure at a hospital or outpatient center. It usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes. You do not need anesthesia. You'll lie on a table while a specially trained x-ray technician inserts a thin tube through your anus and into your rectum. The tube inflates your large intestine with air for a better view. The table slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the technician takes the x-ray images. You will turn over on your side or stomach to get more images taken. For a flexible sigmoidoscopy: You will have the procedure at a hospital, medical office, or outpatient center. It usually takes about 20 minutes. You do not need anesthesia. You'll lie on a table while the doctor inserts a thin tube through your anus and into your rectum. The tube inflates your large intestine with air for a better view. The camera sends a video image to a monitor so your doctor can see your lower colon. Once the scope has reached the top of the lower colon, the doctor will slowly remove the scope. While doing so, your doctor will examine your lower colon again. If you have polyps, your doctor may remove them and send them to a lab for testing. Most polyps aren't cancer, but removing them can prevent them from becoming cancer later on. If you have abnormal tissue, your doctor may do a biopsy. What should I expect after a colonoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, or flexible sigmoidoscopy? You may feel cramping in your abdomen or bloating during the first hour after the any of these procedures. If the doctor removed polyps or performed a biopsy, you may have light bleeding from your anus. This bleeding is normal. For a virtual colonoscopy or a flexible sigmoidoscopy, you go back to your regular activities and diet right after the test. For a colonoscopy, you can expect a full recovery and return to your normal diet by the next day. Your doctor will give you the results of your procedure. If you had a biopsy, it can take a few days to get those results. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",MedlinePlus

Colorectal Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/colorectalcancer.html,"What is colorectal cancer? Colorectal cancer is cancer that develops in the tissues of the colon or rectum. Your colon and rectum are part of your digestive system: Your colon is the first and longest part of your large intestine. It absorbs water and some nutrients from foods. It also changes the leftover waste products into stool (poop). Your rectum is the lower part of your large intestine. It's where your body stores stool. Cancer that begins in the colon is called colon cancer, and cancer that begins in the rectum is called rectal cancer. Cancer that affects either of these parts may also be called colorectal cancer. What causes colorectal cancer? Colorectal cancer happens when there are changes in your genetic material (DNA) . These changes are also called mutations or variants. Often, the genetic changes that lead to colorectal cancer happen during your lifetime and the exact cause is unknown. But certain genetic changes that raise your risk for colorectal cancer are inherited, meaning that you are born with them. Besides genetics, other factors, including your lifestyle and the environment, can affect your risk of colorectal cancer. Who is more likely to develop colorectal cancer? Anyone can get colorectal cancer, but certain factors make you more likely to develop it: Being older; your risk of getting colorectal cancer increases as you age. Having a personal or family history of colorectal cancer. Having a history of adenomas. Adenomas are colorectal polyps (growths) that look abnormal under a microscope or are 1 centimeter or larger. Adenomas are not cancer, but they can sometimes turn into cancer over time. Having a genetic syndrome such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer). Having chronic ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease for 8 years or more. Having three or more alcoholic drinks per day. Smoking cigarettes . Being Black; Black people have an increased risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer compared to other races. Having obesity . What are the symptoms of colorectal cancer? Colorectal cancer may not always cause symptoms, especially at first. If you do have symptoms, they could include: A change in bowel habits that lasts more than a few days, such as: Diarrhea Constipation Feeling that the bowel does not empty completely Your stool is narrower or has a different shape than usual Blood (either bright red or very dark) in the stool Frequent gas pains, bloating, fullness, or cramps Weight loss for no known reason Fatigue What is screening for colorectal cancer and who needs it? Because colorectal cancer may not cause symptoms at first, it's important to have screening tests for colorectal cancer . Screening tests look for signs of a disease before you have any symptoms. They can help find cancer early, when it may be easier to treat. Most experts recommend that start screenings at 45 and continue until at least age 75. People over 75 and those who are at high risk should talk to their providers about how often you need screening and what type of test they should get. The types of tests include different stool tests and procedures such as colonoscopies and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Talk with your provider about how often you need screening and what type of test you should get. How is colorectal cancer diagnosed? If you have symptoms that could be caused by colorectal cancer or if your screening test results are abnormal, you may need to have more tests to find out if you have cancer. Possible tests include: A physical exam. A digital rectal exam. For this exam, your provider inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum to feel for lumps or anything unusual. The tests that are also used for screening (colonoscopy, stool tests, etc.) and biopsy , if you have not already had them. Other blood and tissue tests. What are the treatments for colorectal cancer? Your treatment options usually depend on your age, your general health, how serious the cancer is, and which type of cancer you have. For colon cancer , your treatment may include one or more of these options: Surgery. Radiofrequency ablation, a procedure that uses radio waves to heat and destroy abnormal cells. The radio waves travel through electrodes (small devices that carry electricity). Cryosurgery, a procedure in which an extremely cold liquid or an instrument called a cryoprobe is used to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue. Chemotherapy . Radiation therapy . Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. Immunotherapy .

Coma,https://medlineplus.gov/coma.html,"A coma is a deep state of unconsciousness.   An individual in a coma is alive but unable to move or respond to his or her environment. Coma may occur as a complication of an underlying illness, or as a result of injuries, such as brain injury . A coma rarely lasts more than 2 to 4 weeks. The outcome for coma depends on the cause, severity, and site of the damage. People may come out of a coma with physical, intellectual, and psychological problems.  Some people may remain in a coma for years or even decades. For those people, the most common cause of death is infection, such as pneumonia.

Common Cold,https://medlineplus.gov/commoncold.html,"What is the common cold? The common cold is a mild infection of your upper respiratory tract (which includes your nose and throat). Colds are probably the most common illness. Adults have an average of 2-3 colds per year, and children have even more. Colds are more common in the winter and spring, but you can get them at any time. What causes the common cold? More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold, but rhinoviruses are the most common type. The viruses that cause colds are very contagious. They can spread from person to person through the air and close personal contact. You can also get infected when you touch something that has the virus on it and then touch your eyes, mouth, or nose. For example, you could get a cold after you shake hands with someone who has a cold or touch a doorknob that has the germs on it, and then touch your face. What are the symptoms of the common cold? The symptoms of a common cold usually include: Sneezing Stuffy nose (congestion) Runny nose Sore throat Coughing Headache The symptoms usually start a few days after you become infected with the virus. Some symptoms can last for 10-14 days. What are the treatments for the common cold? There is no cure for the common cold. But there are treatments that can make you feel better while you wait for the cold to go away on its own: Getting lots of rest. Drinking plenty of fluids. Using a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer. Gargling with warm salt water. Using saline nose drops or sprays. Taking over-the-counter pain or cold and cough medicines . But you need to be careful with certain medicines: Children and teens should not take aspirin. Some cold and cough medicines contain ingredients that are not recommended for children. Talk with your child's health care provider before giving your child any cold and cough medicines. Some cold and cough medicines contain pain relievers. If you also take a separate pain reliever with these medicines, you could be getting a dangerous amount of the pain reliever. Read the labels on the medicines and follow the instructions carefully. If you have questions, ask your provider or a pharmacist. Antibiotics will not help with a cold. Antibiotics help with bacterial infections, not with viral infections such as colds. Most people who have a cold will feel better after a week or two. However, some people who get a cold may develop other illnesses, such as bronchitis or pneumonia . This is more common in people with weakened immune systems, asthma , or other respiratory conditions. Contact your provider if you or your child have symptoms that concern you, such as: Trouble breathing or fast breathing Dehydration Fever that lasts longer than 4 days Symptoms that last more than 10 days without improvement Symptoms, such as fever or cough, that improve but then return or worsen Worsening of chronic medical conditions Can the common cold be prevented? There is no vaccine to protect against the common cold. But you may be able to reduce your risk of getting or spreading a cold by: Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Avoiding touching your face, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Avoiding close contact, such as kissing, shaking hands, and sharing cups and eating utensils, with others if you are sick or they are sick.

Concussion,https://medlineplus.gov/concussion.html,"A concussion is a type of brain injury .  It involves a short loss of normal brain function. It happens when a hit to the head or body causes your head and brain to move rapidly back and forth. This sudden movement can cause the brain to bounce around or twist in the skull, creating chemical changes in your brain. Sometimes it can also stretch and damage your brain cells. Sometimes people call a concussion a ""mild"" brain injury. It is important to understand that while concussions may not be life-threatening, they can still be serious. Concussions are a common type of sports injury . Other causes of concussions include blows to the head, bumping your head when you fall, being violently shaken, and car accidents. Symptoms of a concussion may not start right away; they may start days or weeks after the injury. Symptoms may include a headache or neck pain. You may also have nausea, ringing in your ears, dizziness, or tiredness. You may feel dazed or not your normal self for several days or weeks after the injury. Consult your health care professional if any of your symptoms get worse, or if you have more serious symptoms such as: Convulsions or seizures Drowsiness or inability to wake up A headache that gets worse and does not go away Weakness, numbness, or decreased coordination Repeated vomiting or nausea Confusion Slurred speech Loss of consciousness To diagnose a concussion, your health care provider will do a physical exam and will ask about your injury. You will most likely have a neurological exam, which checks your vision, balance, coordination, and reflexes. Your health care provider may also evaluate your memory and thinking. In some cases, you may also have a scan of the brain, such as a CT scan or an MRI . A scan can check for bleeding or inflammation in the brain, as well as a skull fracture (break in the skull). Most people recover fully after a concussion, but it can take some time. Rest is very important after a concussion because it helps the brain to heal. In the very beginning, you may need to limit physical activities or activities that involve a lot of concentration, such as studying, working on the computer, or playing video games. Doing these may cause concussion symptoms (such as headache or tiredness) to come back or get worse. Then when your health care provider says that it is ok, you can start to return to your normal activities slowly. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus
Congenital Heart Defects,https://medlineplus.gov/congenitalheartdefects.html,"What are congenital heart defects? Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are problems with the structure of the heart. ""Congenital"" means that that the problems are present at birth. These defects happen when a fetus's heart doesn't develop normally during pregnancy. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect . Congenital heart defects can change the way the heart pumps blood. They may make blood flow too slowly, go the wrong way, or block it completely. There are many types of congenital heart defects. They can happen in one or more parts of the heart. The most common types are: Septal defects (""hole in the heart"") - openings in the wall between the left and right sides of the heart Heart valve defects - problems with the valves that control the flow of blood through the heart Defects in the large blood vessels that carry blood in and out of the heart Congenital heart defects can range from very mild problems that never need treatment to life-threatening problems at birth. The most serious congenital heart defects are called critical congenital heart disease . Babies with these defects usually need surgery in the first year of life. But the symptoms of milder heart defects may not show up until childhood or adulthood. What causes congenital heart defects? Researchers often don't know what causes congenital heart defects. They do know that changes in a baby's genes sometimes cause a heart defect. The changed genes may come from the parents, or the changes may happen during pregnancy. Who is more likely to have a baby with a congenital heart defect? Several things may increase the chance that your baby has a congenital heart defect, such as: Your health before and during pregnancy , including: Having diabetes before pregnancy or developing it in the first 3 months of pregnancy (diabetes that develops later in pregnancy isn't a major risk for heart defects). Carefully controlling your blood glucose , also called blood sugar, before and during pregnancy can lower your baby's risk of congenital heart defects. Having phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare inherited disorder that affects how the body uses a protein in foods. If you have PKU, eating a low-protein diet before getting pregnant can lower your baby's risk of having a congenital heart defect. Having rubella (German measles) during pregnancy. Your contact with certain substances during pregnancy , including: Smoking or secondhand smoke (breathing smoke from another smoker). Certain medicines , such as angiotensin-converting (ACE) inhibitors for high blood pressure and retinoic acids for acne. If you're pregnant or plan to get pregnant, talk with your health care provider about all the medicines you take. Your family history and genetics. In most cases, congenital heart defects don't run in families. But your chance of having a baby with a congenital heart defect does go up if you or the other parent has a congenital heart defect, or if you already have a child with a congenital heart defect. What are the symptoms of congenital heart defects? Congenital heart defects don't cause pain. The signs and symptoms are different, depending on the type and number of defects and how serious they are. Common signs and symptoms of congenital heart defects include: Cyanosis - a bluish color to the skin, lips, and fingernails. It happens when there isn't enough oxygen in the blood. Fatigue - your baby may be unusually sleepy and may become very tired during feedings. Poor blood flow. Fast or difficult breathing. Heart murmur - an unusual sound between heartbeats. What other problems do congenital heart defects cause? Congenital heart defects don't always cause other problems. If they do, which problems you have would depend on the type and number of defects and how serious the defects are. Children with congenital heart defects are more likely to: Be smaller than other children Have problems or delays in mental, and emotional growth, and behavior, such as: Speech and language problems Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) People with congenital heart defects may develop other health conditions, including: Endocarditis - an infection of lining of the heart and valves Arrhythmia - a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat Heart failure - when your heart can't pump enough blood to the body Pulmonary hypertension - high blood pressure in your lungs Kidney and liver disease How are congenital heart defects diagnosed? Before a baby is born , your provider may use ultrasound pictures of the fetus's heart to look for heart defects. This is called a fetal echocardiogram. It's done between weeks 18 and 22 of pregnancy. During the first few days after birth , all newborns are checked for congenital heart defects. A pulse oximeter is clipped to your baby's hands or feet to measure blood oxygen. If it shows low levels of blood oxygen, more tests will be needed to find out if your baby has a heart defect. To diagnose congenital heart defects in babies, children, and adults , a provider may use many tools, including: A physical exam. Certain heart tests to see how the heart is working. Genetic testing to see if certain gene problems caused the defect. What are the treatments for congenital heart defects? Treatment depends on the type of congenital heart defect and how serious it is. Possible treatments include: Cardiac catheterization to repair simple defects, such as a small hole in the inside wall of the heart. A catheterization uses a thin tube guided through a vein and into the heart. Heart surgery may be needed to: Repair defects in the heart and blood vessels. Repair or replace a heart valve. Place a device in the chest to help the heart pump blood. Do a heart transplant Medicine is often used if your baby has a specific type of congenital heart defect called patent ductus arteriosus. All children and adults who have congenital heart defects need regular follow-up care from a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) throughout their life, even if their defect was repaired. Some people may need several heart surgeries or catheterizations over the years. They may also need to take medicines to help their hearts work as well as possible.

COPD,https://medlineplus.gov/copd.html,"What is COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. Normally, the airways and air sacs in your lungs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, the airways bring air to the air sacs. The air sacs fill up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. If you have COPD, less air flows in and out of your airways because of one or more problems: The airways and air sacs in your lungs become less elastic The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged What are the types of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? COPD includes two main types: Emphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs, as well as the walls between them. They become damaged and are less elastic. Chronic bronchitis , in which the lining of your airways is constantly irritated and inflamed. This causes the lining to swell and make mucus. Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person. What causes COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? The cause of COPD is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause COPD, especially if you inhale them. Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to COPD. These include secondhand smoke , air pollution , and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace. Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing COPD. Who is at risk for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? The risk factors for COPD include: Smoking. This is the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants , such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace Age. Most people who have COPD are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin. Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get COPD are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD. Asthma. People who have asthma have more risk of developing COPD than people who don't have asthma. But most people with asthma will not get COPD. What are the symptoms of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include: Frequent coughing or a cough that produces a lot of mucus Wheezing A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity Tightness in your chest Some people with COPD get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu . In severe cases, COPD can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs. How is COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A family history Various tests, such as lung function tests , a chest x-ray or CT scan , and blood tests Your doctor will diagnose COPD based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results. What are the treatments for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? There is no cure for COPD. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include: Lifestyle changes , such as Quitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat COPD. Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants Ask your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness. Medicines , such as Bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation. Vaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with COPD are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases Antibiotics if you get a bacterial lung infection Oxygen therapy , if you have severe COPD and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times. Pulmonary rehabilitation , which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include An exercise program Disease management training Nutritional counseling Psychological counseling Surgery , usually as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines: For COPD that is mainly related to emphysema, there are surgeries that: Remove damaged lung tissue Remove large air spaces (bullae) that can form when air sacs are destroyed. The bullae can interfere with breathing. For severe COPD, some people may need lung transplant If you have COPD, it's important to know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. Call your health care provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever . Can COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) be prevented? Since smoking causes most cases of COPD, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke.

Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/coronaryarterybypasssurgery.html,"What is coronary artery bypass surgery? Coronary artery bypass surgery creates a new path for blood to flow to your heart. This surgery is sometimes called a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or heart bypass. It's the most common heart surgery in adults. You may need this surgery if you have a blocked or partially blocked artery in your heart. This surgery is often used to treat coronary artery disease (CAD). Your coronary arteries supply blood to your heart. If you have coronary artery disease, a sticky material called plaque builds up in your coronary arteries. This can cause them to harden and narrow. When this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood. Before recommending surgery, your health care provider may try other treatments. These could include lifestyle changes , medicines, or angioplasty , a procedure to open your arteries. If these treatments don't help, you may need coronary artery bypass surgery. Who might benefit from coronary artery bypass surgery? Your provider may recommend surgery if you have obstructive coronary artery disease to help lower your risk of a heart attack . They will consider your overall health before deciding if surgery is your best option. You may benefit from surgery if you have: Coronary heart disease with angina (chest pain) Diabetes Multiple blocked coronary arteries Serious heart failure You might need emergency coronary artery bypass surgery to treat a severe heart attack. What happens during coronary artery bypass surgery? During surgery, the surgeon takes healthy blood vessels from another part of your body. These blood vessels are attached to blood vessels above and below the blocked artery to let blood bypass (get around) the blockage. You might need more than one bypass if you have a few blocked arteries. Methods to perform coronary artery bypass surgery include: Traditional CABG. The chest is cut open to reach the heart. A machine pumps blood through your body during the surgery. This is the most common type of CABG surgery. Off-pump CABG. The chest is cut open to reach the heart. A machine for pumping blood is not used. Minimally invasive CABG methods. Small cuts are made in the chest. A machine for pumping blood is not used. Robotic-assisted surgery. This is a type of minimally invasive surgery. The surgeon uses a computer to control tools on the arms of a robot. A machine for pumping blood may be used. Are there any risks from coronary artery bypass surgery? Like all surgery, CABG has risks even though the results are often excellent. The risks can include: Arrhythmia Bleeding Heart attack Infection Kidney failure Stroke After coronary artery bypass surgery, many people remain symptom-free for years. You may need surgery again if blockages form in the grafted arteries or veins. Or if blockages happen in arteries that weren't blocked before. Lifestyle changes and medicines may help stop your arteries from becoming clogged again. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Coronary Artery Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/coronaryarterydisease.html,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease. It is the leading cause of death in the United States in both men and women. CAD happens when the arteries that supply blood to heart muscle become hardened and narrowed. This is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis . As it grows, less blood can flow through the arteries. As a result, the heart muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can lead to chest pain ( angina ) or a heart attack .  Most heart attacks happen when a blood clot suddenly cuts off the hearts' blood supply, causing permanent heart damage. Over time, CAD can also weaken the heart muscle and contribute to heart failure and arrhythmias . Heart failure means the heart can't pump blood well to the rest of the body.

CPR,https://medlineplus.gov/cpr.html,"When someone's blood flow or breathing stops, seconds count. Permanent brain damage or death can happen quickly. If you know how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), you could save a life. CPR is an emergency procedure for a person whose heart has stopped (called sudden cardiac arrest ) or who is no longer breathing. CPR can maintain the blood flow breathing until emergency medical help arrives. Take these steps if someone is in sudden cardiac arrest: Call 911. If someone else is around, have them look for an automated external defibrillator (AED). An AED is a device that sends an electric shock to the heart to try to restore its normal rhythm. AEDs are available in many public places such as schools, businesses, and airports . Make sure that the person with sudden cardiac arrest is lying on their back on a firm surface. If you haven't had any CPR training, you can do ""hands-only"" CPR for a teen or adult whose heart has stopped beating (""hands-only"" CPR isn't recommended for children). ""Hands-only"" CPR uses chest compressions to keep blood circulating. Chest compressions involve pushing hard and fast in the center of the chest. If you've had training, you can use chest compressions, clear the airway, and do rescue breathing. Rescue breathing helps get oxygen to the lungs for a person who has stopped breathing. To keep your skills up, repeat the CPR training every two years. Use the AED as soon as possible, if there is one available.",MedlinePlus

Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ulcerative colitis and microscopic colitis are other common types of IBD. What causes Crohn's disease? The cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. Researchers think that an autoimmune reaction may be one cause. An autoimmune reaction happens when your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body. Genetics may also play a role, since Crohn's disease can run in families. Stress and eating certain foods don't cause the disease, but they can make your symptoms worse. Who is more likely to develop Crohn's disease? There are certain factors that may raise your risk of Crohn's disease: Family history of the disease. Having a parent, child, or sibling with the disease puts you at higher risk. Smoking . This may double your risk of developing Crohn's disease.

They include: Alzheimer's disease , which is the most common form of dementia among older people. People with Alzheimer's have plaques and tangles in their brain. These are abnormal buildups of different proteins. Beta-amyloid protein clumps up and forms plaques in between your brain cells. Tau protein builds up and forms tangles inside the nerve cells of your brain. There is also a loss of connection between nerve cells in the brain. Lewy body dementia , which causes movement symptoms along with dementia. Lewy bodies are abnormal deposits of a protein in the brain. Frontotemporal disorders, which cause changes to certain parts of the brain: Changes in the frontal lobe lead to behavioral symptoms Changes in the temporal lobe lead to language and emotional disorders Vascular dementia, which involves changes to the brain's blood supply. It is often caused by a stroke or atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) in the brain. Mixed dementia, which is a combination of two or more types of dementia. For example, some people have both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Other conditions can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms, including: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a rare brain disorder Huntington's disease , an inherited, progressive brain disease Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), caused by repeated traumatic brain injury HIV-associated dementia (HAD) Who is at risk for dementia? Certain factors can raise your risk for developing dementia, including: Aging. This is the biggest risk factor for dementia. Smoking Uncontrolled diabetes High blood pressure Drinking too much alcohol Having close family members who have dementia What are the symptoms of dementia? The symptoms of dementia can vary, depending on which parts of the brain are affected. Often, forgetfulness is the first symptom.  Dementia also causes problems with the ability to think, problem solve, and reason.

The symptoms of dengue include: A high fever Nausea and vomiting Rash Aches and pains (eye pain, usually behind the eyes, and pain in the muscles, joints, or bones) The symptoms usually last two to seven days. Severe dengue is a serious form of the illness. About 1 in 20 people who get sick with dengue will develop severe dengue. It can cause shock , internal bleeding, and even death. People are more likely to develop severe dengue if they have had dengue before, are pregnant, or are infants. Watch for signs and symptoms of severe dengue. Warning signs usually begin about 24 - 48 hours after your fever has gone away. If you or your family member have these signs, get immediate medical care: Severe abdominal (belly) pain and tenderness Vomiting at least 3 times in 24 hours Bleeding from the nose or gums Vomiting blood, or blood in the stool (poop) Feeling tired, restless, or irritable How is dengue diagnosed?

Dentures,https://medlineplus.gov/dentures.html,"Dentures are false teeth made to replace teeth you have lost. They can be complete or partial. Complete dentures cover your entire upper or lower jaw. Partials replace one or a few teeth. Dentures may feel strange at first. Speaking and eating may feel different. Be careful when wearing dentures because they may make it harder for you to feel hot foods and liquids. Also, you may not notice biting on a bone from your food. In the beginning, your dentist may want to see you often to make sure the dentures fit. Over time, your mouth will change and you may need to have your dentures adjusted or replaced. Be sure to let your dentist handle these adjustments. If your dentures move too much in your mouth, denture adhesive may help. In some cases, your dentist may suggest that you switch to dental implants. They are permanent, and they replace both the roots and teeth. Keep your dentures clean and free from food that can cause stains, bad breath, or swollen gums. Brush them every day with a denture care product. Take your dentures out of your mouth at night, and put them in water or a denture-cleansing liquid. NIH: National Institute on Aging",MedlinePlus
Depression,https://medlineplus.gov/depression.html,"What is depression? Depression is more than a feeling of being sad or irritable for a few days. It's a serious mood disorder . As one of the most common mental disorders in the United States, depression can affect how you think, feel, and your everyday life. You may not know why you feel this way, but even basic daily activities such as sleeping, eating, or working may become difficult. Depression often needs long-term treatment but getting help at the earliest sign of a problem can help manage your symptoms. What are the different types of depression? The most common types of depression are major depression and persistent depressive disorder. Major depression symptoms include a depressed mood or a loss of interest. Symptoms affect your daily activities and last for at least two weeks. Persistent depressive disorder (also called dysthymia or dysthymic disorder) has less severe depressive symptoms, but they last longer, usually for at least two years. Other types of depression can include: Seasonal affective disorder comes and goes with the seasons. It usually starts in late fall and early winter and goes away during the spring and summer. Bipolar disorder is sometimes called manic depression. This mood disorder can cause intense mood swings. Depression with symptoms of psychosis is a severe form of depression that also has delusions (false beliefs) or hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling something that isn't there). What causes depression? There are a variety of things that may cause depression, including genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Depression can happen at any age and can affect anyone, but it's more common in women. This is often due to the physical and hormonal changes that women have during menstruation, pregnancy, the postpartum period , and menopause. Other mental disorders or chronic medical conditions such as diabetes , cancer , or heart disease may occur with depression. This may make the chronic condition or depression worse. In some cases, there is no clear cause for depression. Who is at risk of depression? You may be at a higher risk of depression if you have a close relative who has it or another mental health disorder. Going through trauma or stressful life events may raise your risk even more. What are the symptoms of depression? Depression doesn't look the same on everyone. The type and number of symptoms of depression can vary and don't always appear like sadness. Depression may affect you differently based on your: Age. The symptoms of depression may be different in a child, who may appear more irritable than sad. Teens may act out or have excessive sleepiness. The symptoms for an older adult may not be as obvious as other age groups. Sex. Men often show symptoms and coping behaviors differently than women. Rather than sad, men may appear angry or irritable. Medical conditions. Some medicines and medical conditions may cause symptoms that look like depression. Chronic conditions may make depression worse. Symptoms of depression are ongoing and affect your day-to-day life. They can include: Feeling sad or ""empty"" Losing interest in favorite activities Overeating, or not wanting to eat at all Sleeping too much, or not enough Feeling very tired Feeling hopeless, irritable, anxious, or guilty Having aches and pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems Having thoughts of death or suicide Changing moods or behaviors Increasing use of alcohol or drugs Isolating from family and friends How is depression diagnosed? If you think you have depression, talk to your health care provider or a mental health provider. To be diagnosed with depression, your provider may use many tools: A medical history will include asking about your symptoms and family history. To be diagnosed with depression, your symptoms must occur most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. One of the symptoms must be a depressed mood or a loss of interest in most activities. Medical tests may be done to rule out other medical conditions. Certain medicines and medical conditions (such as viruses or thyroid disorders ) may cause symptoms like depression. A physical exam to make sure another issue isn't causing your symptoms. A mental health evaluation by your provider or a mental health provider. What are the treatments for depression? Depression may need long-term treatment. Most treatments include medicines and/or psychotherapy (talk therapy): Medicines such as antidepressants may help control your symptoms. You may need to try several medicines to find which works best for you. Medicine may take time to work and can have side effects. Don't stop taking your medicine without first talking with your provider. Contact your provider if you have any concerns about side effects from the medicine. Psychotherapy (talk therapy) under the care of a mental health provider can help you recognize and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. This may be done one-on-one or in a group setting. It can give you and your family support, education, skills, and coping strategies. Light therapy has been shown to be effective for seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Other treatments options may be considered if treatment isn't working or if depression is severe. These may include: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a brain stimulation procedure that uses a mild electric current when you are under general anesthesia. ECT is most often used for severe depression that is not getting better with other treatments. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a brain stimulation procedure that uses magnetic waves to relieve depression. It's not as powerful as ECT, but with rTMS, you don't need anesthesia. It also has a low risk of negative effects on your memory and thinking. Can depression be prevented? Most cases of depression can't be prevented, but healthy lifestyle changes can have long-term benefits for your mental health. These can include: Getting regular exercise Having a consistent sleep schedule Controlling stress If you, or someone you love is depressed, see your provider or a mental health provider. It's important to get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem. If you or someone you know has thoughts of hurting themselves or attempting suicide, get help right away.

Diabetes,https://medlineplus.gov/diabetes.html,"What is diabetes? Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease in which your blood glucose , or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose is your body's main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but it also comes from the food you eat. Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas. Insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells, where it can be used for energy. If you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin, can't use insulin as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get too high. Over time, high blood glucose levels can lead to serious health conditions . But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems. What are the types of diabetes? There are different types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes . If you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin. It happens when your immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes . This is the most common form of diabetes. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body may still be able to make insulin, but your cells don't respond well to insulin. They can't easily take up enough glucose from your blood. Gestational diabetes . This is a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It happens when your body can't make the extra insulin it needs during pregnancy. What causes diabetes? The different types of diabetes have different causes: Researchers think type 1 diabetes is caused by genes and factors in the environment that might trigger the disease. Type 2 diabetes is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes . The lifestyle factors include not being physically active and being overweight or having obesity . Researchers think gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors. Who is more likely to develop diabetes? The different types of diabetes have different risk factors: You can develop type 1 diabetes at any age, but it most often starts in childhood. Having a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes may increase your chance of developing it. You are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you: Are overweight or have obesity. Are over age 35. Children, teenagers, and younger adults can get diabetes, but it is more common in middle-aged and older adults. Have a family history of diabetes. Have prediabetes . This means that your blood glucose is higher than normal, but it's not high enough to be called diabetes. Had gestational diabetes. Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more. Are African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander. Are not physically active. Have certain other health conditions, such as high blood pressure or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Diabetic Diet,https://medlineplus.gov/diabeticdiet.html,"What is diabetes? If you have diabetes , your blood glucose , or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells. With type 1 diabetes , your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes , your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood glucose levels. Prediabetes means that your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. How do the foods I eat affect my blood glucose levels? The glucose in your blood comes from certain foods called carbohydrates , or ""carbs."" Foods that are high in carbs include candy and sweets, sodas, breads, tortillas, and white rice. The more carbs you eat, the higher your blood glucose level will be. Whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, making the right food choices is an important way to keep your blood glucose at a level that is healthy for you. When you control your blood glucose, you lower your chance of having serious health problems from diabetes , such as vision loss and heart problems . And if you have prediabetes or are at risk for diabetes, eating foods that keep your blood glucose levels healthy may help prevent type 2 diabetes later on. What's the best diet for diabetes? There isn't a specific diet or meal plan that works for everybody. Your health care provider may have you see a registered dietician (RD) or a diabetes educator who can help design the best eating plan for you. The plan will consider: Any medicines that you take Your weight Any other health conditions you have Your lifestyle and tastes Your goals All eating plans for diabetes have a few things in common, including eating the right foods in the right amounts at the right times . What foods should I eat if I have diabetes? Eating the right foods for diabetes means eating a variety of healthy foods from all the food groups: Fruits and vegetables Whole grains, such as whole wheat, brown rice, barley, quinoa, and oats Proteins , such as lean meats, chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, nuts, beans, lentils, and tofu Nonfat or low-fat dairy, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese What foods should I limit to control my blood glucose? To keep your blood glucose under control, you may need to cut back on certain foods and drinks. This doesn't mean that you can never enjoy them. But you will need to have them less often or in smaller amounts. High-carb foods and drinks, such as: Sugary foods, such as candy, cookies, cake, ice cream, sweetened cereals, and canned fruits with added sugar Drinks with added sugars, such as juice, regular soda, and regular sports or energy drinks White rice, tortillas, breads and pasta - especially those made with white flour Starchy vegetables, such as white potatoes, corn, and peas Fried foods and other foods high in saturated trans fats . Foods high in sodium (salt). Alcohol. If you do drink, you should drink moderately. This means no more than one standard drink a day if you're a woman or two standard drinks a day if you're a man. What else do I need to know about diabetic diets? If you have diabetes, it's important to eat the right amount of food every day. Your eating plan will include how much to eat, so that you get the right amount of carbs in each meal or snack. You'll learn how to count carbs and measure your food. Eating at the right times is also important. You will want to plan for regular, balanced meals to avoid blood glucose levels that are too high or too low for you. Eating about the same amount of carbs at each meal can be helpful. Your eating plan will also teach you how to stick with your plan at home and when you eat out. Eating healthy to control your blood glucose does take some effort. But the reward is a chance to live your healthiest life with diabetes.

Over time, high blood glucose may damage the blood vessels and lenses in your eyes. This can lead to serious diabetic eye problems which can harm your vision and sometimes cause blindness . Some common diabetic eye problems include: Diabetic retinopathy , which is the leading cause of blindness in American adults. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). The blood vessels may swell and leak fluid into your eye. If it's not treated, it can cause serious problems such as vision loss and retinal detachment , where the retina is pulled away from its normal position at the back of your eye. Diabetic macular edema (DME) , which happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula (the part of the retina needed for sharp, central vision). This usually develops in people who already have other signs of diabetic retinopathy. Glaucoma , a group of eye diseases that can damage the optic nerve (the bundle of nerves that connects the eye to the brain). Glaucoma from diabetes happens when the blood vessels in the front of your eye are damaged, and new blood vessels grow near the iris (the colored part of your eye). The blood vessels block the space where fluid drains from your eye. This causes fluid to build up and pressure to increase inside your eye. Cataract , which is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. It happens when the clear lens in the front of your eye becomes cloudy. Cataracts are common as people age. But people with diabetes are more likely to develop cataracts younger and faster than people without diabetes. Researchers think that high glucose levels cause deposits to build up in the lenses of your eyes. Who is more likely to develop diabetic eye problems? Anyone with diabetes can develop diabetic eye disease. But your risk of developing it is higher if you have diabetes and: Have had diabetes for a long time Don't have good control over your high blood glucose or high blood pressure Are pregnant Have high blood cholesterol Smoke tobacco What are the symptoms of diabetic eye problems? In the early stages, diabetic eye problems usually don't have any symptoms. That's why regular dilated eye exams are so important, even if you think your eyes are healthy. You should also watch for sudden changes in your vision that could be signs of an emergency. Call your eye care professional right away if you notice any of these symptoms: Many new spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision (floaters) Flashes of light A dark shadow over part of your vision, like a curtain Vision loss Eye pain or redness Talk with your eye care professional if you have these symptoms, even if they come and go: Spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision Blurry or wavy vision Vision that changes a lot Trouble seeing colors How are diabetic eye problems diagnosed? Eye care professionals do dilated eye exams to diagnose eye problems. A dilated eye exam uses eye drops to open your pupils wide so your eye care professional can look for signs of eye problems and treat them before they harm your vision. They will also test your vision and measure the pressure in your eyes. What are the treatments for diabetic eye problems? Treatment for diabetic eye problems depends on the problem and how serious it is. Some of the treatments include: Lasers to stop blood vessels from leaking Injections (shots) in the eye to stop new, leaky blood vessels from growing Surgery to remove blood and scar tissue or replace a cloudy lens Eye drops to lower fluid pressure in the eye But these treatments aren't cures. Eye problems can come back. That's why your best defense against serious vision loss is to take control of your diabetes and get regular eye exams. It's also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol in a healthy range. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",MedlinePlus

The glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels. How does diabetes cause foot problems? Foot problems are common in people with diabetes. They can happen over time when high blood sugar damages the nerves and blood vessels in the feet. The nerve damage, called diabetic neuropathy , can cause numbness, tingling, pain, or a loss of feeling in your feet. If you can't feel pain, you may not know when you have a cut, blister , or ulcer (open sore) on your foot. A wound like that could get infected. The infection may not heal well because the damaged blood vessels can cause poor blood flow in your feet. Having an infection and poor blood flow can lead to gangrene . That means the muscle, skin, and other tissues start to die. If you have gangrene or a foot ulcer that does not get better with treatment, you may need an amputation . This is a surgery to cut off your damaged toe, foot, or part of your leg. It may prevent a bad infection from spreading and could save your life. But there's a lot you can do to prevent a foot wound from becoming a major health problem. How can I protect my feet if I have diabetes? The best way to protect your feet is by controlling your blood sugar levels every day. This will help keep nerve and blood vessel damage from getting worse. The next step is to keep the skin of your feet healthy. Good foot care for people with diabetes includes: Checking your feet every day. Look for cuts, redness, and other changes in the skin and toenails, including warts or other spots that your shoes could rub. Make sure to check the bottoms of your feet too. Washing your feet every day. Use warm water and soap. Don't soak your feet because that can dry out your skin. After you dry your feet, you can use talcum powder or cornstarch between your toes. They soak up moisture that can cause infection. If you use lotion, don't apply it between your toes. Asking your doctor how to remove corns and calluses safely. Thick skin on your feet can rub and lead to sores. But removing it the wrong way could damage your skin. So you don't want to cut the skin or use medicated pads or liquid removers. Trimming your toenails straight across with a clipper. If it's hard for you to trim your own toenails, or if they're thick or curve into the skin, have a podiatrist (foot doctor) do it for you. Always wearing well-fitting shoes and socks or slippers to protect your feet when walking. You don't want to walk barefoot, even indoors. And be sure your shoes are smooth inside. A seam or pebble could rub your skin raw. Protecting your feet from heat and cold. Use sunscreen on exposed skin and don't walk barefoot at the beach. In cold weather, wear warm socks instead of warming your feet near a heater or fireplace. Keeping the blood flowing in your feet. Put your feet up when you're sitting. Wiggle your toes and circle your feet throughout the day. Don't wear tight socks. And get plenty of activity that's not too hard on the feet, such as walking. Getting your feet checked at your health care visits. Even if you haven't noticed a problem, it's good to have your health care provider look at your feet. When should I see my health care provider about diabetic foot problems? Serious foot problems can develop quickly. See your health care provider right away if you notice: A cut, blister, or bruise on your feet that doesn't start to heal in a few days Red, warm, or painful skin on your feet A callus with dried blood inside A foot infection that becomes black and smells bad that could be gangrene Remember, controlling your blood sugar and caring for your feet every day are the best steps you can take to prevent serious diabetic foot problems.

Diabetic heart disease is a term for heart disease in people who have diabetes. If you have diabetes, you are much more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke than people who don't have diabetes. And you may start having these problems at a younger age. Over time, the effects of high blood sugar from diabetes can include damage to the blood vessels and nerves in your heart. This damage increases your chance of developing heart diseases, including: Coronary artery disease (CAD) . It happens slowly as a sticky material called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood. Heart failure . With this condition, your heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet the needs of your body. Cardiomyopathy . This is a group of diseases in which the heart muscle may become thick or stiff. Who is more likely to develop diabetic heart disease? Diabetes puts you at serious risk for heart disease. It also makes you more likely to develop other conditions that raise your risk even more, including: High blood pressure High blood levels of LDL ""bad"" cholesterol High triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood) with low blood levels of HDL ""good"" cholesterol Your risk for heart disease is also higher if you Are male Smoke Have obesity Have too much belly fat around your waist, even though you're at a healthy weight: For men, that's a waist more than 40 inches For women, that's a waist more than 35 inches Have a family history of heart disease Have chronic kidney disease What are the symptoms of diabetic heart disease? In the early stages, heart disease usually doesn't have any symptoms. But if your heart disease worsens, you can have symptoms. Your symptoms will depend on the type of heart disease you have. They might include: Shortness of breath Fatigue Dizziness or fainting Arrhythmia (problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Swollen feet and ankles Chest pain It's important to know that people with diabetes may not feel chest pain. That's because diabetes can damage the nerves in your heart. If you have any symptoms that could be heart disease, talk with your health care provider. How is diabetic heart disease diagnosed? To find out if you have diabetic heart disease, your provider will: Ask about your medical history , including your symptoms and other health conditions you may have Ask about your family history , to find out if you have relatives who have or had heart disease Do a physical exam Likely run some tests to help understand your personal risk for heart disease , including: Blood tests to check your cholesterol , triglycerides , and blood sugar levels A blood-pressure check Heart tests , if needed Depending on your risk level, your provider may send you to a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) for care.

Diarrhea,https://medlineplus.gov/diarrhea.html,"What is diarrhea? Diarrhea is loose, watery stools (bowel movements). You have diarrhea if you have loose stools three or more times in one day. Acute diarrhea is diarrhea that lasts a short time. It is a common problem.  It usually lasts about one or two days, but it may last longer. Then it goes away on its own. Diarrhea lasting more than a few days may be a sign of a more serious problem. Chronic diarrhea -- diarrhea that lasts at least four weeks -- can be a symptom of a chronic disease. Chronic diarrhea symptoms may be continual, or they may come and go. What causes diarrhea? The most common causes of diarrhea include: Bacteria from contaminated food or water Viruses such as the flu , norovirus , or rotavirus . Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea in children. Parasites, which are tiny organisms found in contaminated food or water Medicines such as antibiotics, cancer drugs, and antacids that contain magnesium Food intolerances and sensitivities, which are problems digesting certain ingredients or foods. An example is lactose intolerance . Diseases that affect the stomach, small intestine, or colon, such as Crohn's disease Problems with how the colon functions, such as irritable bowel syndrome Some people also get diarrhea after stomach surgery, because sometimes the surgeries can cause food to move through your digestive system more quickly. Sometimes no cause can be found. If your diarrhea goes away within a few days, finding the cause is usually not necessary. Who is at risk for diarrhea? People of all ages can get diarrhea. On average, adults In the United States have acute diarrhea once a year. Young children have it an average of twice a year. People who visit developing countries are at risk for traveler's diarrhea . It is caused by consuming contaminated food or water. What other symptoms might I have with diarrhea? Other possible symptoms of diarrhea include: Cramps or pain in the abdomen An urgent need to use the bathroom Loss of bowel control If a virus or bacteria is the cause of your diarrhea, you may also have a fever, chills, and bloody stools. Diarrhea can cause dehydration , which means that your body does not have enough fluid to work properly. Dehydration can be serious, especially for children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. When do I need to see a health care provider for diarrhea?

Severe pain in your abdomen or rectum (for adults) A fever of 102 degrees or higher Stools containing blood or pus Stools that are black and tarry If children have diarrhea, parents or caregivers should not hesitate to call a health care provider. Diarrhea can be especially dangerous in newborns and infants. How is the cause of diarrhea diagnosed? To find the cause of diarrhea, your health care provider may: Do a physical exam Ask about any medicines you are taking Test your stool or blood to look for bacteria, parasites, or other signs of disease or infection Ask you to stop eating certain foods to see whether your diarrhea goes away If you have chronic diarrhea, your health care provider may perform other tests to look for signs of disease. What are the treatments for diarrhea? Diarrhea is treated by replacing lost fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration. Depending on the cause of the problem, you may need medicines to stop the diarrhea or treat an infection. Adults with diarrhea should drink water, fruit juices, sports drinks, sodas without caffeine, and salty broths. As your symptoms improve, you can eat soft, bland food. Children with diarrhea should be given oral rehydration solutions to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Can diarrhea be prevented? Two types of diarrhea can be prevented - rotavirus diarrhea and traveler's diarrhea. There are vaccines for rotavirus. They are given to babies in two or three doses. You can help prevent traveler's diarrhea by being careful about what you eat and drink when you are in developing countries: Use only bottled or purified water for drinking, making ice cubes, and brushing your teeth If you do use tap water, boil it or use iodine tablets Make sure that the cooked food you eat is fully cooked and served hot Avoid unwashed or unpeeled raw fruits and vegetables NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",MedlinePlus

Also, some disabilities are ""visible"" (easy to see), for example when someone is in a wheelchair. But other disabilities are ""invisible"" (hidden or not easy to see), such as problems with hearing, thinking, or learning. What causes disabilities? Disabilities can have different causes. Some disabilities are present at birth, while others may happen later in life. Causes of disabilities that are present at birth can include: Disorders in single genes , such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy Disorders of chromosomes, such as Down syndrome Exposures (before birth) to infections or substances , such as drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes Causes of disabilities that happen later in life can include: Injuries, such as spinal cord injuries , traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), and back injuries Chronic (long-lasting) diseases, such as diabetes , heart disease , kidney disease , COPD , and arthritis Cancer Mental health problems Stroke Alzheimer's disease and other causes of dementia How can disabilities affect your health?

Your shoulders are the most movable joints in your body. They are also the most commonly dislocated joints. The most common causes of shoulder dislocations are: Sports injuries Accidents, including traffic accidents Falling on your shoulder or outstretched arm Seizures and electric shocks, which can cause muscle contractions that pull the arm out of place Who is at risk for a dislocated shoulder? A dislocated shoulder can happen to anyone, but they are more common in young men, who are more often involved in sports and other physical activities. Older adults, especially women, are also at higher risk because they are more likely to fall. What are the symptoms of a dislocated shoulder? The symptoms of a dislocated shoulder include: Severe shoulder pain Swelling and bruising of your shoulder or upper arm Numbness and/or weakness in your arm, neck, hand, or fingers Trouble moving your arm Your arm seems to be out of place Muscle spasms in your shoulder If you are having these symptoms, get medical treatment right away. How is a dislocated shoulder diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will take a medical history and examine your shoulder. Your provider may also ask you to get an x-ray to confirm the diagnosis. What are the treatments for a dislocated shoulder? The treatment for dislocated shoulder usually involves three steps: The first step is a closed reduction, a procedure in which your health care provider puts the ball of your upper arm back into the socket. You may first get medicine to relieve the pain and relax your shoulder muscles. Once the joint is back in place, the severe pain should end. The second step is wearing a sling or other device to keep your shoulder in place. You will wear it for a few days to several weeks. The third step is rehabilitation, once the pain and swelling have improved. You will do exercises to improve your range of motion and strengthen your muscles. You may need surgery if you injure the tissues or nerves around the shoulder or if you get repeated dislocations. A dislocation can make your shoulder unstable. When that happens, it takes less force to dislocate it. This means that there is a higher risk of it happening again. Your health care provider may ask you to continue doing some exercises to prevent another dislocation.",MedlinePlus
Dislocations,https://medlineplus.gov/dislocations.html,"Dislocations are joint injuries that force the ends of your bones out of position. The cause is often a fall or a blow, sometimes from playing a contact sport . You can dislocate your ankles, knees, shoulders , hips, elbows and jaw. You can also dislocate your finger and toe joints. Dislocated joints often are swollen, very painful and visibly out of place. You may not be able to move it. A dislocated joint is an emergency.  If you have one, seek medical attention. Treatment depends on which joint you dislocate and the severity of the injury. It might include manipulations to reposition your bones, medicine, a splint or sling, and rehabilitation. When properly repositioned, a joint will usually function and move normally again in a few weeks. Once you dislocate a shoulder or kneecap, you are more likely to dislocate it again. Wearing protective gear during sports may help prevent dislocations.",MedlinePlus
Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis,https://medlineplus.gov/diverticulosisanddiverticulitis.html,"What is diverticulosis? Diverticula are small pouches, or sacs, that bulge outward through weak spots in your colon. They mostly form in the lower part of the colon. Diverticulosis is a condition in which you have these pouches. Most people who have diverticulosis do not have symptoms or problems. But sometimes the pouches can cause symptoms or become inflamed. What is diverticulitis? Diverticulitis is the name for the condition you have when one or more of the pouches get inflamed. Diverticulitis may come on suddenly. It can sometimes cause serious health problems. What is diverticular disease? Diverticular disease is a condition that happens when the pouches cause: Chronic (long-term) symptoms Diverticular bleeding Diverticulitis or diverticulitis complications What causes diverticulosis and diverticulitis? Researchers aren't sure what causes diverticulosis and diverticulitis. They think certain factors may play a role in causing or increasing the risk for these conditions, including: Your genetics. Certain genes may make some people more likely to develop the conditions. Lifestyle factors such as: Diets low in fiber and high in red meat Lack of physical activity Taking certain medicines, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroids Having obesity Smoking Researchers are also looking at other possible factors that may play a role in these conditions. Those factors include bacteria or stool (poop) getting caught in a pouch in your colon and changes in the microbiome in the intestines. Your microbiome is made up of the bacteria and other organisms in your intestines. Who is more likely to develop diverticulosis and diverticulitis? Diverticulosis is common, especially as people age. More than one-third of U.S. adults between the ages of 50 and 59 have diverticulosis. More than two-thirds who are over age 80 have it. Most of those people will not have symptoms or problems. But some of them will develop diverticulitis. What are the symptoms of diverticulosis and diverticulitis? Diverticulosis usually doesn't cause symptoms. But some people can have chronic symptoms such as: Bloating Constipation or diarrhea Cramping or pain in the lower abdomen (belly) Diverticulitis may cause acute symptoms such as: Abdominal pain, most often in the lower left side of your abdomen Constipation or diarrhea Fevers and chills Nausea or vomiting The pain caused by diverticulitis is usually severe and comes on suddenly. Less often, the pain may be mild and worsen over several days. What other problems can diverticulosis and diverticulitis cause? Some people with diverticulosis and diverticulitis may develop serious health problems (complications). Diverticular bleeding happens when a small blood vessel within the wall of a pouch bursts. The bleeding may be severe and sometimes even life-threatening. People with diverticulitis can also develop serious problems such as: Abscess , a painful, swollen, pus-filled area caused by infection Fistula , an abnormal opening or passage between the colon and another part of the body, such as the bladder or vagina Intestinal obstruction , a partial or total blockage that keeps food, fluids, air, or stool from moving through your intestines Perforation, or a hole, in your colon Peritonitis , an infection of the lining of the abdominal cavity How are diverticulosis and diverticulitis diagnosed? Diverticulosis may be found when your health care provider is doing tests for another reason. Diverticulitis is usually found when you are having an acute attack. To make a diagnosis, your provider will review your medical history, do a physical exam, and order tests. The tests may include: Blood tests Stool tests Imaging tests such as CT scan , ultrasound , or MRI Colonoscopy What are the treatments for diverticulosis and diverticulitis? f your diverticulosis is causing chronic symptoms, your provider may recommend: High-fiber foods or fiber supplements Antibiotics Medicines to reduce inflammation Probiotics If you have diverticulitis without complications, your provider may recommend treatment at home. However, you probably need treatment in the hospital if you have severe diverticulitis, diverticulitis with complications, or a high risk for complications. Treatments for diverticulitis may include: Antibiotics, except for very mild cases. A clear liquid diet for a short time to rest the colon. Your provider may suggest slowly adding solid foods to your diet as your symptoms improve. Medicines for pain. This is usually acetaminophen instead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs may increase the chance of diverticulitis complications. Antispasmodic medicines to relieve spasms. If your diverticulitis doesn't improve with treatment or if it causes complications, you may need surgery to remove part of your colon. Can diverticulitis be prevented? Your provider may recommend lifestyle changes to prevent diverticulitis: Eating a diet high in fiber and low in red meat Being physically active on a regular basis Not smoking (and quitting smoking if you are a smoker) Reaching and maintaining a healthy weigh t NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",MedlinePlus

Down Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/downsyndrome.html,"What is Down syndrome? Down syndrome is a condition in which a person has an extra chromosome or an extra piece of a chromosome. This extra copy changes how a baby's body and brain develop. It can cause both mental and physical challenges during their lifetime. Even though people with Down syndrome might act and look similar, each person has different abilities. What causes Down syndrome? Chromosomes are tiny ""packages"" in your cells that contain your genes. Genes carry information, called DNA, that controls what you look like and how your body works. People with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21.  In some cases, they may have an extra copy of part of the chromosome. Having an extra copy of a chromosome is called trisomy. So sometimes Down syndrome is also called trisomy 21. Down syndrome is usually not inherited. It happens by chance, as an error when cells are dividing during early development of the fetus . It is not known for sure why Down syndrome occurs or how many different factors play a role. One factor that increases the risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is the age of the mother. Women ages 35 and older are more likely to have a baby with Down syndrome. What are the symptoms of Down syndrome? The symptoms of Down syndrome are different in each person. And people with Down syndrome may have different problems at different times of their lives. They usually have mild to moderate intellectual disabilities. Their development is often delayed . For example, they may start talking later than other children. Some of the common physical signs of Down syndrome include: A flat face Eyes that slant up A short neck Small hands and feet Poor muscle tone Loose joints What other problems does Down syndrome cause? Many people with Down syndrome have the common physical signs and have healthy lives. But some people with Down syndrome might have one or more birth defects or other health problems. Some of the more common ones include: Hearing loss Sleep apnea (a disorder that causes you to repeatedly stop breathing during sleep) Ear infections Eye diseases Congenital heart defects (heart defects that are present at birth) Digestive problems Problems with the upper part of the spine Obesity How is Down syndrome diagnosed? Health care providers can check for Down syndrome during pregnancy or after a child is born. There are two basic types of tests that help find Down syndrome during pregnancy : Prenatal screening tests can show whether your unborn baby has a higher or lower chance of having Down syndrome. If a screening test shows that your baby could have Down syndrome, you'll need another test to find out for sure. Prenatal diagnostic tests can diagnose or rule out Down syndrome by checking the chromosomes in a sample of cells. These tests have a small risk of causing a miscarriage, so they're often done after a screening test shows that an unborn baby could have Down syndrome. After a baby is born, the provider may make an initial diagnosis of Down syndrome based on the physical signs of the syndrome. The provider can use a karyotype genetic test to confirm the diagnosis. The test can check for extra chromosomes in a sample of the baby's blood. What are the treatments for Down syndrome? There is no single, standard treatment for Down syndrome. Treatments are based on each person's physical and intellectual needs, strengths, and limitations. Services early in life focus on helping children with Down syndrome develop to their full potential. These services include speech, occupational, and physical therapies. They are typically offered through early intervention programs in each state. Children with Down syndrome may also need extra help or attention in school, although many children are included in regular classes. Since people with Down syndrome can have birth defects and other health problems, they will need regular medical care. They may need to have certain extra health screenings to check for problems that happen more often in people with Down syndrome. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus

Drug Reactions,https://medlineplus.gov/drugreactions.html,"Most of the time, medicines make our lives better. They reduce aches and pains, fight infections, and control problems such as high blood pressure or diabetes. But medicines can also cause unwanted reactions, such as drug interactions, side effects, and allergies. What is a drug interaction? A drug interaction is a change in the way a drug acts in the body when taken with certain other drugs, foods, or supplements or when taken while you have certain medical conditions. Examples include: Two drugs, such as aspirin and blood thinners Drugs and food, such as statins and grapefruit Drugs and supplements, such as gingko and blood thinners Drugs and medical conditions, such as aspirin and peptic ulcers Interactions could cause a drug to be more or less effective, cause side effects, or change the way one or both drugs work. What are side effects? Side effects are unwanted, usually unpleasant, effects caused by medicines. Most are mild, such as a stomachache, dry mouth , or drowsiness, and go away after you stop taking the medicine.  Others can be more serious. Sometimes a drug can interact with a disease that you have and cause a side effect. For example, if you have a heart condition, certain decongestants can cause you to have a rapid heartbeat. What are drug allergies? Drug allergies are another type of reaction. They can range from mild to life-threatening. Skin reactions, such as hives and rashes , are the most common type. Anaphylaxis , a serious allergic reaction, is less common. How can I stay safe when taking medicines?

What is drug addiction? Drug addiction is a chronic brain disease. It causes a person to take drugs repeatedly, despite the harm they cause. Repeated drug use can change the brain and lead to addiction. The brain changes from addiction can be lasting, so drug addiction is considered a ""relapsing"" disease. This means that people in recovery are at risk for taking drugs again, even after years of not taking them. Does everyone who takes drugs become addicted? Not everyone who uses drugs becomes addicted. Everyone's bodies and brains are different, so their reactions to drugs can also be different. Some people may become addicted quickly, or it may happen over time. Other people never become addicted. Whether or not someone becomes addicted depends on many factors. They include genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. Who is at risk for drug addiction? Various risk factors can make you more likely to become addicted to drugs, including: Your biology. People can react to drugs differently. Some people like the feeling the first time they try a drug and want more. Others hate how it feels and never try it again. Mental health problems. People who have untreated mental health problems , such as depression , anxiety , or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more likely to become addicted.

Dual Diagnosis,https://medlineplus.gov/dualdiagnosis.html,"What is dual diagnosis? If you have a dual diagnosis, that means that you have both a mental disorder and a substance use disorder (SUD), either with alcohol or drugs . A dual diagnosis is a type of comorbidity, which is when someone has two disorders at the same time. Another name for this is co-occurring disorders. Mental and substance use disorders often occur together. Many people who develop SUDs are also diagnosed with mental disorders. And the reverse is true; many people with mental disorders will develop an SUD. Having both types of disorders is even more common in teenagers, people with serious mental illness, and people with certain mental disorders. Why do substance use disorders and mental disorders occur together? Although these problems often occur together, this does not mean that one caused the other, even if one appeared first. In fact, it can be hard to figure out which came first. Researchers think that there are three possible reasons as to why they often occur together: Common risk factors can contribute to both mental disorders and SUDs. These factors include: Genetics. Stress . Trauma, especially in childhood. Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also at risk for SUDs Mental disorders can contribute to drug use and SUDs. For example, people with mental disorders may use drugs or alcohol to try to feel better temporarily. This is known as self-medication. Also, mental disorders may change the brain to make it more likely that you will become addicted. Substance use and addiction can contribute to the development of a mental disorder. Substance use may change the brain in ways that make you more likely to develop a mental disorder. What are the treatments for dual diagnosis? If you have a dual diagnosis, it is usually better to treat both conditions at the same time rather than separately. You and your health care provider can work on a treatment plan that fits your needs.The plan should take into account your age, which substance(s) you are misusing, and which specific mental disorder(s) you have. The plan may include: Behavioral therapy, such as talk therapy (psychotherapy), long-term residential treatment (which combines housing and treatment services), and therapies to help you stay motivated to stick with your treatment plan.

The vibrations travel to your inner ear, a snail-shaped organ. The inner ear makes the nerve impulses that are sent to the brain. Your brain recognizes them as sounds. The inner ear also controls balance. A variety of conditions may affect your hearing or balance : Ear infections are the most common illness in infants and young children. Tinnitus , a roaring in your ears, can be the result of loud noises, medicines or a variety of other causes. Meniere's disease may be the result of fluid problems in your inner ear; its symptoms include tinnitus and dizziness. Ear barotrauma is an injury to your ear because of changes in barometric (air) or water pressure. Some ear disorders can result in hearing disorders and deafness .",MedlinePlus
Ear Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/earinfections.html,"Ear infections are the most common reason parents bring their child to a doctor. Three out of four children will have at least one ear infection by their third birthday.  Adults can also get ear infections, but they are less common. The infection usually affects the middle ear and is called otitis media. The tubes inside the ears become clogged with fluid and mucus. This can affect hearing, because sound cannot get through all that fluid. If your child isn't old enough to say ""My ear hurts,"" here are a few things to look for: Tugging at ears Crying more than usual Fluid draining from the ear Trouble sleeping Balance difficulties Hearing problems Your health care provider will diagnose an ear infection by looking inside the ear with an instrument called an otoscope. Often, ear infections go away on their own. Your health care provider may recommend pain relievers. Severe infections and infections in young babies may require antibiotics. Children who get infections often may need surgery to place small tubes inside their ears. The tubes relieve pressure in the ears so that the child can hear again.

Eating Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/eatingdisorders.html,"What are eating disorders? Eating disorders are serious mental health disorders. They involve severe problems with your thoughts about food and your eating behaviors. You may eat much less or much more than you need. Eating disorders are medical conditions; they are not a lifestyle choice. They affect your body's ability to get proper nutrition. This can lead to health issues, such as heart and kidney problems, or sometimes even death. But there are treatments that can help. What are the types of eating disorders? Common types of eating disorders include: Binge-eating , which is out-of-control eating. People with binge-eating disorder keep eating even after they are full. They often eat until they feel very uncomfortable. Afterward, they usually have feelings of guilt, shame, and distress. Eating too much too often can lead to weight gain and obesity . Binge-eating disorder is the most common eating disorder in the U.S. Bulimia nervosa. People with bulimia nervosa also have periods of binge-eating. But afterwards, they purge, by making themselves throw up or using laxatives. They may also over-exercise or fast. People with bulimia nervosa may be slightly underweight, normal weight, or overweight. Anorexia nervosa. People with anorexia nervosa avoid food, severely restrict food, or eat very small quantities of only certain foods. They may see themselves as overweight, even when they are dangerously underweight. Anorexia nervosa is the least common of the three eating disorders, but it is often the most serious. It has the highest death rate of any mental disorder. What causes eating disorders? The exact cause of eating disorders is unknown. Researchers believe that eating disorders are caused by a complex interaction of factors. These include genetic, biological, behavioral, psychological, and social factors. Who is at risk for eating disorders? Anyone can develop an eating disorder, but they are more common in women. Eating disorders frequently appear during the teen years or young adulthood. But people can also develop them during childhood or later in life. What are the symptoms of eating disorders? The symptoms of eating disorders vary, depending on the disorder: The symptoms of binge-eating include: Eating unusually large amounts of food in a specific amount of time, such as a 2-hour period Eating even when you're full or not hungry Eating fast during binge episodes Eating until you're uncomfortably full Eating alone or in secret to avoid embarrassment Feeling distressed, ashamed, or guilty about your eating Frequently dieting, possibly without weight loss The symptoms of bulimia nervosa include the same symptoms as binge-eating, plus trying to get rid of the food or weight after binging by: Purging, making yourself throw up or using laxatives or enemas to speed up the movement of food through your body Doing intensive and excessive exercise Fasting Over time, bulimia nervosa can cause health problems such as: Chronically inflamed and sore throat Swollen salivary glands in the neck and jaw area Worn tooth enamel and increasingly sensitive and decaying teeth . This is caused by the exposure to stomach acid every time you throw up. GERD (acid reflux) and other gastrointestinal problems Severe dehydration from purging Electrolyte imbalance , which could be too low or too high levels of sodium, calcium, potassium and other minerals. This can lead to a stroke or heart attack . The symptoms of anorexia nervosa include: Eating very little, to the point of starving yourself Intensive and excessive exercise Extreme thinness Intense fear of gaining weight Distorted body image - seeing yourself as overweight even when you are severely underweight Over time, anorexia nervosa can cause health problems such as: Thinning of the bones (osteopenia or osteoporosis ) Mild anemia Muscle wasting and weakness Thin, brittle hair and nails Dry, blotchy, or yellowish skin Growth of fine hair all over the body Severe constipation Low blood pressure Slowed breathing and pulse Feeling cold all the time because of a drop in internal body temperature Feeling faint, dizzy , or weak Feeling tired all the time Infertility Damage to the structure and function of the heart Brain damage Multiorgan failure Anorexia nervosa can be fatal. Some people with this disorder die of complications from starvation, and others die of suicide . Some people with eating disorders may also have other mental disorders (such as depression or anxiety ) or problems with substance use . How is eating disorders diagnosed? Because eating disorders can be so serious, it is important to seek help if you or a loved one thinks that you might have a problem. Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. It is important to be honest about your eating and exercise behaviors so your provider can help you. A physical exam Blood or urine tests to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms Other tests to see whether you have any other health problems caused by the eating disorder. These can include kidney function tests and an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG). What are the treatments for eating disorders? Treatment plans for eating disorders are tailored to individual needs. You will likely have a team of providers helping you, including doctors, nutritionists, nurses, and therapists. The treatments may include: Individual, group, and/or family psychotherapy. Individual therapy may include cognitive behavioral approaches, which help you to identify and change negative and unhelpful thoughts. It also helps you build coping skills and change behavioral patterns. Medical care and monitoring, including care for the complications that eating disorders can cause Nutrition counseling. Doctors, nurses, and counselors will help you eat healthy to reach and maintain a healthy weight. Medicines, such as antidepressants , antipsychotics, or mood stabilizers, may help treat some eating disorders. The medicines can also help with the depression and anxiety symptoms that often go along with eating disorders. Some people with serious eating disorders may need to be in a hospital or in a residential treatment program. Residential treatment programs combine housing and treatment services.

Ebola,https://medlineplus.gov/ebola.html,"What is Ebola? Ebola, also known as Ebola virus disease (EVD), is a type of hemorrhagic fever . It is a rare and often deadly disease. It can be caused by several different types of Ebola viruses. There are occasional outbreaks of Ebola, and they mostly occur in Africa. How does Ebola spread? Researchers believe that the virus first spreads from an infected animal to a human. Ebola can then spread from human to human through direct contact with: Blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola. Objects (such as clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment) contaminated with body fluids from a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola. Semen (through oral, vaginal, or anal sex) from a man who has recovered from Ebola. The virus can remain in semen and other body fluids, even if the person no longer has symptoms. When people become infected with Ebola, they do not start developing signs or symptoms right away. They cannot spread Ebola to others until after they develop symptoms. What are the symptoms of Ebola? The symptoms of Ebola may appear anywhere from 2 to 21 days after exposure to the virus. The average is about 8 to 10 days. The symptoms usually include: Fever Headache Joint and muscle aches Weakness and fatigue Sore throat Gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal (belly) pain , diarrhea , and vomiting Loss of appetite Unexplained bleeding or bruising Other symptoms may include a rash , red eyes, and hiccups. How is Ebola diagnosed? The early symptoms of Ebola are similar to other more common diseases. This makes it difficult to diagnose Ebola in someone who has been infected for only a few days. If a person has the symptoms of Ebola and may have been exposed to the virus, the health care provider can do a blood test for Ebola. It can take a few days after the symptoms start before Ebola shows up in the blood test. What are the treatments for Ebola? In the United States, there are two approved medicines to treat Ebola that is caused by one specific type of virus ( Zaire ebolavirus ). These medicines have not been evaluated to treat Ebola caused by other types of Ebola viruses. The medicines are monoclonal antibodies, which are immune system proteins that are created in the lab. Whether or not there are medicines to treat a case of Ebola, there is supportive care. This type of care can improve the chances of survival, especially when given early. Supportive care includes: Giving fluids and electrolytes Giving medicines to support blood pressure, reduce vomiting and diarrhea, and to manage fever and pain Giving oxygen Treating any other complications or infections People who recover may still have side effects afterwards, such as fatigue, muscle aches, eye and vision problems , and stomach pain. Can Ebola be prevented? In the United States, there is one vaccine that has been approved to prevent Ebola caused by one specific type of Ebola virus ( Zaire ebolavirus ). It may be given to health care providers who will be or may be treating Ebola patients and people who work with live Ebola virus in labs. If you live in or plan to travel to a region where Ebola virus may be present, you can help protect yourself by avoiding contact with: Blood and body fluids of people who are sick Semen from a man who has recovered from Ebola, until testing shows that the virus is gone from his semen Items that could be contaminated with blood or body fluids from someone who has Ebola Bats, forest antelopes, and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys and chimpanzees), including their blood, fluids, or meat Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus

Emphysema,https://medlineplus.gov/emphysema.html,"What is emphysema? Emphysema is a type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. The other main type of COPD is chronic bronchitis . Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person. Emphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs. Normally, these sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs in the lungs are damaged. This causes the air sacs to lose their shape and become floppy. The damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. This makes it harder for your lungs to move oxygen in and carbon dioxide out of your body. What causes emphysema? The cause of emphysema is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and the airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause emphysema, especially if you inhale them. Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to emphysema. These include secondhand smoke , air pollution , and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace. Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing emphysema. Who is at risk for emphysema? The risk factors for emphysema include: Smoking. This the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have emphysema smoke or used to smoke. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants , such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace. Age. Most people who have emphysema are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin. Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get emphysema are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD. What are the symptoms of emphysema? At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include: Frequent coughing or wheezing A cough that produces a lot mucus Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe Tightness in your chest Some people with emphysema get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu . In severe cases, emphysema can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs. How is emphysema diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A family history Other tests, such as lung function tests , a chest x-ray or CT scan , and blood tests What are the treatments for emphysema? There is no cure for emphysema. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include: Lifestyle changes , such as Quitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat emphysema. Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants Ask your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness. Medicines , such as Bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation. Vaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with emphysema are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases Antibiotics if you get a bacterial or viral lung infection Oxygen therapy , if you have severe emphysema and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times. Pulmonary rehabilitation , which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include An exercise program Disease management training Nutritional counseling Psychological counseling Surgery , usually as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines. There are surgeries to Remove damaged lung tissue Remove large air spaces (bullae) that can form when air sacs are destroyed. The bullae can interfere with breathing. Do a lung transplant . This is might be an option if you have very severe emphysema. If you have emphysema, it's important to know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. Call your health care provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever . Can emphysema be prevented? Since smoking causes most cases of emphysema, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke. It's also important to try to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, and dusts. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Encephalitis,https://medlineplus.gov/encephalitis.html,"What is encephalitis? Encephalitis is inflammation (swelling) of the brain. It can happen when an infection or medical condition that affects the brain activates your immune system. The inflammation can cause a wide range of symptoms. In extreme cases, it can lead to brain damage, stroke , or even death. What causes encephalitis? There are different types of encephalitis, based on what the cause is. The two main types are infectious encephalitis and autoimmune encephalitis. Infectious encephalitis is usually caused by a virus . In fact, viruses are the most common cause of encephalitis. Some of the different viruses that cause it include: Herpes viruses, including herpes simplex (HSV), the Epstein-Barr virus (which causes infectious mononucleosis ) and the varicella-zoster virus (which causes chickenpox ). Viruses you can get if you are bitten by an infected tick , such as tick-borne encephalitis (TBE virus) and Powassan virus. Viruses you can get if you are bitten by an infected mosquito , such as eastern equine encephalitis virus, West Nile virus , and La Crosse virus. Enteroviruses, which are a common group of viruses that mostly cause mild illness or respiratory infection. These infections usually happen in the summer and fall. Bacteria , fungi , and parasites can also cause infectious encephalitis. But this is not common. Autoimmune encephalitis happens when your immune system mistakenly attacks healthy brain cells. It can be triggered by conditions such as certain cancers, benign tumors , and infections. Sometimes the cause is not known. Who is more likely to get encephalitis? Anyone can get encephalitis, but you are more likely to get it if you: Have a weakened immune system, for example from having HIV or taking certain medicines. These could include medicines taken after an organ transplant , certain chemotherapy medicines, and specialized treatments for certain autoimmune diseases . Are a young child or older adult. Live in areas where there are ticks and mosquitoes that carry viruses that can cause encephalitis. What are the symptoms of encephalitis? The symptoms of encephalitis can vary a lot, depending on how severe it is. Many people do not have any symptoms. Others may have mild flu-like symptoms such as fever , fatigue , headache , or body aches. If encephalitis becomes more serious, it can cause: Severe headache Stiff neck Vomiting Seizures Behavior changes Drowsiness Muscle weakness Partial paralysis in your arms and legs Coma Encephalitis can be dangerous in infants. Their symptoms may include: Fever Lethargy (weakness or drowsiness) Poor feeding Vomiting Body stiffness Unusual irritability or crying A full or bulging fontanel (the soft spot on the top of the head) If you or your child is having symptoms of encephalitis, it's important to get medical care right away. How is encephalitis diagnosed? To find out if you have encephalitis, your health care provider: Will do a physical exam Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms May do a neurologic exam May order imaging tests , such as a brain CT scan or MRI May order an EEG (electroencephalography), which use small electric sensors to measure your brain activity May order blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests What are the treatments for encephalitis? Most people with encephalitis will need treatment in the hospital. Depending on the cause, treatments may include antiviral medicines, antibiotics , corticosteroids , and other medicines. For some types of encephalitis, there is no medicine to treat it. But rest, nutrition, and fluids can help your body fight the infection and relieve symptoms. Some people may need physical, speech, and occupational therapy once the illness is under control. Can encephalitis be prevented? There are steps you can take to help prevent encephalitis that is caused by infections: Use good hygiene , including washing your hands often with soap and water. Don't share food, drinks, utensils, and glasses with other people. Get vaccines for viruses that can cause encephalitis. Avoid mosquito and tick bites, for example by: Wearing insect repellent with DEET or another U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent. Make sure to follow the instructions for using the repellant. Wearing clothes that cover your arms, legs and feet.

Endocarditis,https://medlineplus.gov/endocarditis.html,"What is endocarditis? Endocarditis is sometimes called infective endocarditis. It's a rare but life-threatening inflammation of the lining inside your heart's chambers and valves (the endocardium). Endocarditis is usually caused by germs that get into your bloodstream and travel to your heart. Once they get inside your heart, the germs can attach to the lining or get trapped in the valves. They start to grow, causing an infection. If not treated quickly, the infection can cause damage to the heart and lead to serious health problems. What causes endocarditis? Bacterial infections cause most endocarditis. Normally, many bacteria live in your mouth, on your skin, or in other parts of the body. Sometimes the bacteria can get into your bloodstream from injuries such cuts or scrapes. Dental work and certain surgeries can also allow small amounts of bacteria to enter your bloodstream. In some cases, fungal infections cause endocarditis. The fungi, such as yeast , can live in parts of your body. Fungal infections generally happen in people who have weakened immune systems that can't stop the fungus from growing. This includes people who have HIV . Who is more likely to develop endocarditis? In general, endocarditis is rare. If you're healthy, your immune system usually destroys the germs in your bloodstream before they can cause harm. But your chance of developing endocarditis may be higher than most people if you: Have certain heart conditions. Damaged or abnormal heart tissue and devices in your heart can trap germs more easily than healthy heart tissue. That means your risk of endocarditis is higher if you have: Heart valve disease . Certain congenital heart defects . A pacemaker or an implantable defibrillator. A heart valve replacement. Are older. Age-related changes to the heart valves, such as mitral valve prolapse or calcium deposits in the aortic valve, create places for germs to attach to the heart. Inject illegal drugs . Unclean needles may carry bacteria into the bloodstream. Have a condition that weakens your immune system . Don't take care of your teeth and gums. Poor dental health makes it easier for germs to get into your bloodstream through your gums and mouth. Have a long-term central venous line , a tube that stays in a large vein for weeks or months for medical treatment. Have already had endocarditis. Endocarditis can damage heart tissue, which increases your risk of getting it again. What are the symptoms of endocarditis? Endocarditis symptoms may be severe or very mild. They may start suddenly or slowly. And they can vary from person to person. The possible symptoms of endocarditis include: Fever and chills New or worsening heart murmur (an unusual sound heard between heartbeats) Chest pain Cough Muscle, joint, and back pain Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep) Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air) Skin changes, including: Broken blood vessels Painful red or purple bumps Painless flat red spots on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet What other problems can endocarditis cause? When the germs are in your heart, they can clump together with blood cells. These clumps can break off and travel through your bloodstream. They may block blood flow, spread infection, or damage your organs, including your brain, lungs, kidneys, and spleen. Endocarditis may sometimes lead to sepsis , a medical emergency that happens when your body has an extreme response to the infection. Endocarditis can also cause serious heart problems including: Heart valve damage Heart failure Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) How is endocarditis diagnosed? To find out if you have endocarditis, your health care provider will: Ask about your medical history , including your symptoms, recent illnesses, and other health conditions that affect your chance of developing endocarditis. Do a physical exam . Likely order tests , such as: Blood tests to check for signs of infection , bacteria , or fungi in your blood . Chest x-rays . Heart tests . What are the treatments for endocarditis? If you have endocarditis, it's important to get treatment quickly. Treatments may include: Medicines: Antibiotics to treat bacterial infections. Antibiotics are usually started through an intravenous (IV) line in the hospital. Antifungal medicine to treat fungal infections. Your provider may suggest taking antifungal medicine for the rest of your life to prevent the infection from coming back. Heart surgery may be needed to repair or replace damaged valves and heart tissue. Surgery may also be done to remove infected tissue. Dental care , especially cleanings, can help reduce the amount of bacteria that grows in your mouth. Treatment may last weeks, and you may need tests to make sure it's working. Your provider will also check you for problems that could develop from endocarditis, such as heart failure or an irregular heartbeat. Can endocarditis be prevented? If you have a higher chance of developing endocarditis than most people, you can reduce your risk if you: Take good care of your teeth and gums every day Have dental exams and cleaning at your dentist's office every 6 months Make heart-healthy habits part of your daily life to help prevent heart disease Call your health care provider right away if you have symptoms that could be endocarditis People with the highest risk for bacterial endocarditis need antibiotics before dental visits or certain medical or surgical procedures.

Hormone diseases also occur if your body does not respond to hormones the way it is supposed to.  Stress, infection and changes in your blood's fluid and electrolyte balance can also influence hormone levels. In the United States, the most common endocrine disease is diabetes . There are many others. They are usually treated by controlling how much hormone your body makes. Hormone supplements can help if the problem is too little of a hormone.",MedlinePlus
Endometriosis,https://medlineplus.gov/endometriosis.html,"What is endometriosis? The uterus, or womb, is the place where a fetus grows during pregnancy. The uterus is lined with tissue (endometrium). Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue like the lining of the uterus grows in other places in your body. These patches of tissue are called ""implants,"" ""nodules,"" or ""lesions."" They are most often found: On or under the ovaries On the fallopian tubes, which carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus Behind the uterus On the tissues that hold the uterus in place On the bowels or bladder In rare cases, the tissue may grow on your lungs or in other parts of your body. What causes endometriosis? Researchers don't know what causes endometriosis. Who is at risk for endometriosis? Endometriosis can affect anyone who menstruates. Certain factors can raise or lower your risk of getting it. You are at higher risk if: You have a mother, sister, or daughter with endometriosis Your period started before age 11 Your monthly cycles are short (less than 27 days) Your menstrual cycles are heavy and last more than 7 days You have a lower risk if: You have been pregnant before Your periods started late in adolescence You breastfeed your babies What are the symptoms of endometriosis? The main symptoms of endometriosis are: Pelvic pain , which often happens during your period Infertility Other possible symptoms include: Painful menstrual cramps , which may get worse over time Pain during or after sex Pain in the intestine or lower abdomen Pain with bowel movements (pooping) or urination (peeing), usually during your period Heavy periods Spotting or bleeding between periods Digestive or gastrointestinal symptoms Fatigue or lack of energy How is endometriosis diagnosed? Surgery is the only way to know for sure that you have endometriosis. First, however, your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and medical history. You will have a pelvic exam and may have some imaging tests . The most common surgery to diagnose endometriosis is a laparoscopy . This is a type of surgery that uses a laparoscope, a thin tube with a camera and light. The surgeon inserts the laparoscope through a small cut in the skin near your belly button. Your provider can make a diagnosis based on how the patches of endometriosis look. They may also do a biopsy to get a tissue sample. What are the treatments for endometriosis? There is no cure for endometriosis, but there are treatments for the symptoms. Your provider will work with you to decide which treatments would be best for you. Treatments for endometriosis pain include: Pain relievers , including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and a prescription medicine specifically for endometriosis. Providers may sometimes prescribe opioids for severe pain. Hormone therapy , which stops the ovaries from making hormones. This may slow the growth of the endometrial tissue and may stop new areas from growing. Types of hormone therapy include: Birth control pills . Progestin therapy. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) medicines (GnRH agonists and antagonists).  These medicines cause a temporary menopause .  After your stop taking the medicines, your menstrual periods will start again, and pregnancy is possible. Surgical treatments for severe pain, including procedures to remove the endometriosis patches or cut some nerves in the pelvis. The surgery may be a laparoscopy or major surgery. Treatments for infertility caused by endometriosis include: Laparoscopy to remove the endometriosis patches In vitro fertilization NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development",MedlinePlus
Endoscopy,https://medlineplus.gov/endoscopy.html,"Endoscopy is a procedure that lets your doctor look inside your body. It uses an instrument called an endoscope, or scope for short.  Scopes have a tiny camera attached to a long, thin tube. The doctor moves it through a body passageway or opening to see inside an organ. Sometimes scopes are used for surgery, such as for removing polyps from the colon. There are many different kinds of endoscopy. Here are the names of some of them and where they look.: Arthroscopy: joints Bronchoscopy: lungs Colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy: large intestine Cystoscopy and ureteroscopy: urinary system Laparoscopy : abdomen or pelvis Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: esophagus and stomach",MedlinePlus
Enlarged Prostate (BPH),https://medlineplus.gov/enlargedprostatebph.html,"What is the prostate? The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder. It makes fluid that is part of semen. What is an enlarged prostate (BPH)? An enlarged prostate is when your prostate gland becomes larger than normal. It's also called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH for short. Benign means not cancer. And hyperplasia means too much cell growth. BPH isn't cancer and it doesn't increase your risk of getting prostate cancer . Usually, the prostate gland continues to grow during adult life. That's why BPH is the most common prostate condition in people over age 50. As the prostate gets bigger, it may press against the bladder and pinch the urethra. This can slow or block the flow of urine out of your bladder. Over time, the bladder muscle may become weak from trying to pass urine through a narrow urethra.  When this happens, your bladder may not empty completely when you urinate. A narrowed urethra and weak bladder cause many of the urinary problems you may have with BPH. What causes an enlarged prostate (BPH)? Researchers aren't sure why the prostate keeps growing. Some researchers think changes in hormones with aging may cause the prostate to get bigger. Who is more likely to develop BPH? You're more likely to develop BPH if you: Are age 40 or older. The chance of getting BPH increases as you get older. Have family members who have had BPH. Have certain health conditions such as: Obesity . Heart disease and problems with blood circulation . Type 2 diabetes . Erectile dysfunction . Don't get enough physical activity . What are the symptoms of BPH? Symptoms of BPH include: Having a frequent or urgent need to urinate Waking up many times to urinate Having problems with urine flow, such as: Trouble starting to urinate A stream that's weak, slow, or stops and starts Dribbling after urination Urinary incontinence Feeling that you can't completely empty your bladder Pain after ejaculation or during urination Urine with an unusual color or smell It's important to see your health care provider if you have any of these symptoms because they could be from a more serious health problem. You should get medical help right away if you: Can't urinate at all Have fever and chills with urination that's painful, frequent, and urgent Have blood in your urine Have pain in your lower abdomen (belly) and urinary tract What other problems can BPH cause? For most people, BPH doesn't cause other problems. But BPH increases your chance of developing serious conditions, including: Acute urinary retention. With this condition, you suddenly can't urinate at all. This a medical emergency .  Acute urinary retention is common in older males and the chance of having it increases with age. It may be triggered by: Taking certain over-the-counter cold or allergy medicines Drinking alcohol Cold temperatures Not moving enough over a long period of time Urinary tract infections (UTIs) Bladder damage and bladder stones Kidney damage How is BPH diagnosed? To find out if you have BPH, your provider will: Ask about your medical history. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take, because certain medicines can make BPH symptoms worse. Ask about your family health history. Examine you. The exam may include a digital rectal exam (DRE) of your prostate. In a DRE, your provider inserts a gloved finger into your rectum to check if your prostate is large, tender, or irregular in any other way. Order medical tests, if needed , such as: Urine tests. A PSA blood test (prostate-specific antigen test). Urodynamic testing to see how well you can hold and release urine. Cystoscopy to look inside your urethra and bladder . Ultrasound pictures of your prostate and urinary tract. A prostate biopsy to diagnose or rule out prostate cancer. What are the treatments for BPH? Not everyone needs treatment for BPH. Treatment options depend on how much your symptoms bother you, your health, age, and the size of your prostate: Lifestyle changes may improve mild symptoms. They include: Drinking less before bedtime or going out Avoiding or cutting back on beverages with caffeine and alcohol Bladder training and exercising the muscles that control urine flow Preventing or treating constipation Medicines can help mild to moderate symptoms by: Stopping the prostate from growing Shrinking the prostate Relaxing muscles to improve urine flow Sometimes combining 2 types of medicine helps more than taking just one type of medicine. Medical procedures can help improve moderate to severe BPH symptoms when medicines don't help enough. There are several different types of procedures. They all use an instrument inserted into the urethra to either: Widen the urethra Destroy part of the prostate with heat Surgery may be helpful when symptoms are severe, other treatments haven't helped, or you have another problem, such as bladder damage. Different types of surgery are used to: Remove part or all of the prostate Make cuts in the prostate to take pressure off the urethra Most BPH surgery is done with tools inserted into the urethra. Your provider can explain the possible benefits and side effects of your treatment options so you can decide what's best for you. Can BPH be prevented? Researchers haven't found ways to prevent BPH. You can take care of your prostate health by: Talking with your provider about your risk for developing an enlarged prostate Getting regular checkups Paying attention to your symptoms so you can get treatment early if you see signs of BPH NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",MedlinePlus

Eosinophilic Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/eosinophilicdisorders.html,"Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell. They help fight off infections and play a role in your body's immune response.  They can also build up and cause inflammation. Normally your blood doesn't have a large number of eosinophils.  Your body may produce more of them in response to: Allergic disorders Skin conditions Parasitic and fungal infections Autoimmune diseases Some cancers Bone marrow disorders In some conditions, the eosinophils can move outside the bloodstream and build up in organs and tissues. This can happen in many different parts of the body, including the esophagus , heart, lungs, blood, and intestines.

Eosinophilic Esophagitis,https://medlineplus.gov/eosinophilicesophagitis.html,"What is eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)? Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic disease of the esophagus. Your esophagus is the muscular tube that carries food and liquids from your mouth to the stomach. If you have EoE, white blood cells called eosinophils build up in your esophagus. This causes damage and inflammation, which can cause pain, trouble swallowing , and food getting stuck in your throat. EoE is rare. But because it is a newly recognized disease, it is being diagnosed more often. Some people who think that they have reflux (GERD) may actually have EoE. What causes eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)? Researchers are not certain about the exact cause of EoE. They think that it is an immune system/allergic reaction to foods or to substances in your environment, such as dust mites, animal dander, pollen, and molds. Certain genes may also play a role in EoE. Who is at risk for eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE)? EoE can affect anyone, but it is more common in people who: Are male Have other allergic diseases, such as hay fever , eczema , asthma and food allergies Have family members with EoE What are the symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)? The most common symptoms of EoE can depend on your age. In infants and toddlers: : Feeding problems Vomiting Poor weight gain and growth Reflux that does not get better with medicines In older children: : Vomiting Abdominal pain Trouble swallowing, especially with solid foods Reflux that does not get better with medicines Poor appetite In adults: : Trouble swallowing, especially with solid foods Food getting stuck in the esophagus Reflux that does not get better with medicines Heartburn Chest pain How is eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) diagnosed? To find out if you have EoE, your doctor will likely: Ask about your symptoms and medical history. Since other conditions can have the same symptoms of EoE, it is important for your doctor to take a thorough history. Do an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. An endoscope is a long, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end of it. Your doctor will run the endoscope down your esophagus and look at it. Some signs that you might have EoE include white spots, rings, narrowing, and inflammation in the esophagus. However, not everyone with EoE has those signs, and sometimes they can be signs of a different esophagus disorder . Do a biopsy. During the endoscopy, the doctor will take small tissue samples from your esophagus. The samples will be checked for a high number of eosinophils. This is the only way to make a diagnosis of EoE. Do other tests as needed. You may have blood tests to check for other conditions. If you do have EoE, you may have blood or other types of tests to check for specific allergies. What are the treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)? There is no cure for EoE. Treatments can manage your symptoms and prevent further damage. The two main types of treatments are medicines and diet. Medicines used to treat EoE are: Steroids, which can help control inflammation. These are usually topical steroids, which you swallow either from an inhaler or as a liquid. Sometimes doctors prescribe oral steroids (pills) to treat people who have serious swallowing problems or weight loss. Acid suppressors such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which may help with reflux symptoms and decrease inflammation. Monoclonal antibodies, which can reduce inflammation and may help with swallowing. They can be used in adults and children over age 12. Dietary changes for EoE include: Elimination diet. If you are on an elimination diet, you stop eating and drinking certain foods and beverages for several weeks. If you are feeling better, you add the foods back to your diet one at a time. You have repeat endoscopies to see whether or not you are tolerating those foods. There are different types of elimination diets: With one type, you first have an allergy test . Then you stop eating and drinking the foods you are allergic to. For another type, you eliminate foods and drinks that commonly cause allergies, such as dairy products, egg, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts and fish/shellfish. Elemental diet. With this diet, you stop eating and drinking all proteins. Instead, you drink an amino acid formula. Some people who do not like the taste of the formula use a feeding tube instead. If your symptoms and inflammation go away completely, you may be able to try adding foods back one at a time, to see whether you can tolerate them. Which treatment your doctor suggests depends on different factors, including your age. Some people may use more than one kind of treatment. Researchers are still trying to understand EoE and how best to treat it. If your treatment is not working well enough and you have narrowing of the esophagus, you may need dilation. This is a procedure to stretch the esophagus. This makes it easier for you to swallow.",MedlinePlus

Evaluating Health Information,https://medlineplus.gov/evaluatinghealthinformation.html,"Why do I need to evaluate health information? Health information is easy to find. But finding reliable health information takes a little effort. Some of the health information you get from newspapers, magazines, books, TV, the Internet, and social media is up to date and trustworthy. But some is not. That's why it's important to evaluate health information for yourself. But how can you tell the good from the bad? There are two key steps: Ask questions before you trust what you read or hear. Discuss the information you find with your health care provider before you rely on it. You may have found good information, but your provider can tell you whether it's good for you . How can I evaluate health information on the Internet? Asking a few questions will help you decide if you can trust a website. You can usually find most of the answers on the site's ""About Us"" page.  If you can't find information about who runs the website, the site may not be trustworthy, and their health information may be unreliable. Some questions to ask are: Who runs the site? Can you trust them to provide balanced, accurate information? Trustworthy sites provide a way to contact the owners with questions or feedback. In general, you'll find good health information on websites run by: Federal government agencies. Medical schools. Large professional or nonprofit organizations. For example, the American College of Cardiology (a professional organization) and the American Heart Association (a nonprofit) and are both reliable sources of information on heart health. What's the purpose of the site? Is it to: Inform the public? Sell products or services? Promote the opinions of a person or group? A trustworthy website has one goal: To give you good information. Who pays for the site? If the site is funded by ads, they should be clearly marked as advertisements.  Watch out for ads designed to look like neutral health information. If a business pays for the site, the health information may favor that business and its products. Is the health information high quality? Good health information doesn't promote one treatment over another. It gives you balanced facts based on research. So, beware of dramatic writing, promises of cures, and claims that sound too good to be true. Those could be signs of a health fraud scam . To evaluate the quality of a website's information, ask: How is the information selected and reviewed to make sure it's accurate? Check the ""About Us"" page to see if the site has: An editorial board of health experts A content review process A selection policy for content Information about their writers' qualifications, which may be listed at the bottom of the articles Where does the information come from? The content pages should have links or references to the sources of the information. Is the information up to date? Content pages should include dates when the information was written, reviewed, or updated. How does the website use your personal information? Look for a privacy policy section to see how your personal information will be used. Don't share information about yourself unless you're comfortable with any risks involved. When you find a website that seems to be trustworthy, don't stop there. Look to see if other reliable sites have similar health information. How can I evaluate health information on social media? A social media post may come from someone you know, but that doesn't guarantee it's good information. Many of the questions you use to evaluate a website also work for social media too. Ask where the information comes from, why it exists, and if anyone is funding it. If you're not sure whether the information you see on social media is trustworthy, don""t share it with others. How can I evaluate health stories in the news? Some news stories about medical research may not include all the facts you need to know.  Ask these questions: Does the story say whether the research involved people or animals? If it was people, how many people were in the study and who were they? How long was the study? What type of study was it? Who paid for the research? If you learn a few tips for understanding medical research , you'll be able to decide if a news story may apply to your health. Then you can discuss the information with your provider. How can I evaluate health information in books? To evaluate health information in books, ask: How old is the book? Is the author an expert on the subject? Does the book offer different points of view or just those of the author? Has the book been reviewed by other experts? Does the book list the sources of the content? After you evaluate health information, talk with your provider before using it to make decisions that may affect your health.

And just as it is important to keep your body healthy, you also need to keep your eyes healthy. Eye Care Tips There are things you can do to help keep your eyes healthy and make sure you are seeing your best: Eat a healthy, balanced diet. Your diet should include plenty or fruits and vegetables, especially deep yellow and green leafy vegetables. Eating fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and halibut can also help your eyes. Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk of developing diabetes. Having diabetes puts you at higher risk of getting diabetic retinopathy or glaucoma . Get regular exercise. Exercise may help to prevent or control diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. These diseases can lead to some eye or vision problems. So if you exercise regularly, you can lower your risk of getting these eye and vision problems. Wear sunglasses. Sun exposure can damage your eyes and raise your risk of cataracts and age-related macular degeneration . Protect your eyes by using sunglasses that block out 99 to 100% of both UV-A and UV-B radiation. Wear protective eye wear. To prevent eye injuries , you need eye protection when playing certain sports, working in jobs such as factory work and construction, and doing repairs or projects in your home. Avoid smoking. Smoking increases the risk of developing age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts and can damage the optic nerve . Know your family medical history. Some eye diseases are inherited, so it is important to find out whether anyone in your family has had them. This can help you determine if you are at higher risk of developing an eye disease. Know your other risk factors. As you get older, you are at higher risk of developing age-related eye diseases and conditions. It is important to know your risk factors because you may be able to lower your risk by changing some behaviors. If you wear contacts, take steps to prevent eye infections. Wash your hands well before you put in or take out your contact lenses. Also follow the instructions on how to properly clean them, and replace them when needed. Give your eyes a rest. If you spend a lot of time using a computer, you can forget to blink your eyes and your eyes can get tired. To reduce eyestrain, try the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look away about 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds. Eye Tests and Exams Everyone needs to have their eyesight tested to check for vision and eye problems. Children usually have vision screening in school or at their health care provider's office during a checkup. Adults may also get vision screenings during their checkups. But many adults need more than a vision screening. They need a comprehensive dilated eye exam. Getting comprehensive dilated eye exams is especially important because some eye diseases may not have warning signs. The exams are the only way to detect these diseases in their early stages, when they are easier to treat. The exam includes several tests: A visual field test to measure your side (peripheral) vision. A loss of peripheral vision may be a sign of glaucoma. A visual acuity test, where you read an eye chart about 20 feet away, to check on how well you see at various distances Tonometry, which measures your eye's interior pressure. It helps to detect glaucoma. Dilation, which involves getting eye drops that dilate (widen) your pupils. This allows more light to enter the eye. Your eye care provider examines your eyes using a special magnifying lens. This provides a clear view of important tissues at the back of your eye, including the retina , macula, and optic nerve. If you have a refractive error and are going to need glasses or contacts , then you will also have a refraction test. When you have this test, you look through a device that has lenses of different strengths to help your eye care professional figure out which lenses will give you the clearest vision. At what age you should start getting these exams and how often you need them depends on many factors. They include your age, race, and overall health.  For example, if you are African American, you are at higher risk of glaucoma and you need to start getting the exams earlier. If you have diabetes, you should get an exam every year.

But some eye conditions or diseases don't have any symptoms and can lead to a permanent loss of vision . Some common eye diseases and conditions include: Cataracts , which happens when the clear lens in the front of your eye becomes cloudy. Cataracts are common as you get older and can lead to vision loss. Optic nerve disorders , which includes glaucoma . Glaucoma usually happens when the fluid pressure inside your eyes slowly rises. Retinal disorders , which are problems with the nerve layer at the back of your eye. Macular degeneration , which is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. Diabetic eye problems , which can cause vision loss and blindness. Conjunctivitis , which is an infection also known as pink eye . It can cause pink or red itchy eyes.

Fatigue,https://medlineplus.gov/fatigue.html,"What is fatigue? Fatigue is a feeling of weariness, tiredness, or lack of energy. It can interfere with your usual daily activities. Fatigue can be a normal response to physical activity, emotional stress , boredom, or lack of sleep. But sometimes it can be a sign of a mental or physical condition. If you have been feeling tired for weeks, contact your health care provider. They can help you find out what's causing your fatigue and recommend ways to relieve it. What causes fatigue? Fatigue itself is not a disease; it's a symptom. It can have many different causes, including pregnancy and various medical problems, treatments, and lifestyle habits such as: Medical problems: Chronic (long-lasting) diseases such as diabetes , COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and heart , liver , kidney and thyroid diseases Untreated pain and diseases like fibromyalgia Anemia Infections Parkinson's disease Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders Recent stroke Mental disorders such as depression and anxiety Treatments: Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy , radiation , and bone marrow transplants Recovering from major surgery Taking certain medicines, such as antidepressants , antihistamines, and medicines for nausea and pain Lifestyle habits: Not getting enough sleep Staying up too late Drinking too much alcohol Substance use Having too much caffeine (which can keep you from getting a good night's sleep) Getting too little or too much exercise Overwhelming fatigue is part of a disorder called myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The fatigue caused by this disorder is different from a tired feeling that goes away after you rest. Instead, the fatigue in ME/CFS lasts a long time, does not get better with rest, and limits your ability to do ordinary daily activities. What can I do to manage fatigue? If you've had fatigue that does not get better after several weeks, call your provider. They will ask questions about your sleep, daily activities, appetite, and exercise. They will likely do a physical exam and order lab tests. Once they decide on a diagnosis, they can tell you what treatments might help. You can also make some lifestyle changes to feel less tired: Get regular physical activity Improve your sleep habits Stop smoking (if you smoke), since smoking is linked to many diseases that can cause fatigue Manage stress Eat a healthy diet and avoid alcohol It also may be helpful for you to keep a fatigue diary. This can help you find patterns throughout the day, such as when you feel more tired and when you have more energy. It can also help you plan for activities that may give you more energy.

Fatty Liver Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/fattyliverdisease.html,"What is fatty liver disease? Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. Fatty liver disease is a condition in which fat builds up in your liver. There are two main types: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) Alcoholic fatty liver disease, also called alcoholic steatohepatitis What is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)? NAFLD is a type of fatty liver disease that is not related to heavy alcohol use. There are two kinds: Simple fatty liver, in which you have fat in your liver but little or no inflammation or liver cell damage. Simple fatty liver typically does not get bad enough to cause liver damage or complications. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), in which you have inflammation and liver cell damage, as well as fat in your liver. Inflammation and liver cell damage can cause fibrosis, or scarring, of the liver. NASH may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer . What is alcoholic fatty liver disease? Alcoholic fatty liver disease is due to heavy alcohol use. Your liver breaks down most of the alcohol you drink, so it can be removed from your body. But the process of breaking it down can generate harmful substances. These substances can damage liver cells, promote inflammation, and weaken your body's natural defenses. The more alcohol that you drink, the more you damage your liver.  Alcoholic fatty liver disease is the earliest stage of alcohol-related liver disease. The next stages are alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Who is at risk for fatty liver disease? The cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is unknown. Researchers do know that it is more common in people who: Have type 2 diabetes and prediabetes Have obesity Are middle aged or older (although children can also get it) Are Hispanic, followed by non-Hispanic Whites. It is less common in African Americans. Have high levels of fats in the blood, such as cholesterol and triglycerides Have high blood pressure Take certain drugs, such as corticosteroids and some cancer drugs Have certain metabolic disorders , including metabolic syndrome Have rapid weight loss Have certain infections, such as hepatitis C Have been exposed to some toxins NAFLD affects about 25% of people in the world. As the rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol are rising in the United States, so is the rate of NAFLD. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disorder in the United States. Alcoholic fatty liver disease only happens in people who are heavy drinkers, especially those who have been drinking for a long period of time. The risk is higher for heavy drinkers who are women, have obesity, or have certain genetic mutations. What are the symptoms of fatty liver disease? Both NAFLD and alcoholic fatty liver disease are usually silent diseases with few or no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, you may feel tired or have discomfort in the upper right side of your abdomen. How is fatty liver disease diagnosed? Because there are often no symptoms, it is not easy to find fatty liver disease. Your doctor may suspect that you have it if you get abnormal results on liver tests that you had for other reasons. To make a diagnosis, your doctor will use: Your medical history A physical exam Various tests, including blood and imaging tests , and sometimes a biopsy As part of the medical history, your doctor will ask about your alcohol use, to find out whether fat in your liver is a sign of alcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). He or she will also ask which medicines you take, to try to determine whether a medicine is causing your NAFLD. During the physical exam, your doctor will examine your body and check your weight and height. Your doctor will look for signs of fatty liver disease, such as: An enlarged liver Signs of cirrhosis, such as jaundice , a condition that causes your skin and whites of your eyes to turn yellow You will likely have blood tests, including liver function tests and blood count tests . In some cases you may also have imaging tests, like those that check for fat in the liver and the stiffness of your liver. Liver stiffness can mean fibrosis, which is scarring of the liver. In some cases you may also need a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, and to check how bad the liver damage is. What are the treatments for fatty liver disease? Doctors recommend weight loss for nonalcoholic fatty liver. Weight loss can reduce fat in the liver, inflammation, and fibrosis. If your doctor thinks that a certain medicine is the cause of your NAFLD, you should stop taking that medicine.  But check with your doctor before stopping the medicine. You may need to get off the medicine gradually, and you might need to switch to another medicine instead. There are no medicines that have been approved to treat NAFLD. Studies are investigating whether a certain diabetes medicine or Vitamin E can help, but more studies are needed. The most important part of treating alcohol-related fatty liver disease is to stop drinking alcohol. If you need help doing that, you may want to see a therapist or participate in an alcohol recovery program. There are also medicines that can help, either by reducing your cravings or making you feel sick if you drink alcohol. Both alcoholic fatty liver disease and one type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) can lead to cirrhosis. Doctors can treat the health problems caused by cirrhosis with medicines, operations, and other medical procedures. If the cirrhosis leads to liver failure, you may need a liver transplant . What are some lifestyle changes that can help with fatty liver disease? If you have any of the types of fatty liver disease, there are some lifestyle changes that can help: Eat a healthy diet, limiting salt and sugar, plus eating lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains Get vaccinations for hepatitis A and B , the flu and pneumococcal disease . If you get hepatitis A or B along with fatty liver, it is more likely to lead to liver failure. People with chronic liver disease are more likely to get infections, so the other two vaccinations are also important. Get regular exercise , which can help you lose weight and reduce fat in the liver Talk with your doctor before using dietary supplements , such as vitamins , or any complementary or alternative medicines or medical practices . Some herbal remedies can damage your liver.",MedlinePlus
Female Infertility,https://medlineplus.gov/femaleinfertility.html,"Infertility means not being able to get pregnant after at least one year of trying (or 6 months if the woman is over age 35).

Most cases of infertility in women result from problems with producing eggs. In primary ovarian insufficiency , the ovaries stop functioning before natural menopause.  In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the ovaries may not release an egg regularly or they may not release a healthy egg. About a third of the time, infertility is because of a problem with the woman.

Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/fetalalcoholspectrumdisorders.html,"Alcohol can harm your baby at any stage during a pregnancy. That includes the earliest stages, before you even know you are pregnant. Drinking during pregnancy can cause a group of conditions called fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Children who are born with FASD can have a mix of problems, such as medical, behavioral, educational, and social problems. The kinds of problems they have depend on which type of FASD they have. The problems could include : Abnormal facial features, such as a smooth ridge between the nose and upper lip Small head size Shorter-than-average height Low body weight Poor coordination Hyperactive behavior Difficulty with attention and memory Learning disabilities and difficulty in school Speech and language delays Intellectual disability or low IQ Poor reasoning and judgment skills Sleep and sucking problems as a baby Vision or hearing problems Problems with the heart, kidneys, or bones Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most serious type of FASD. People with fetal alcohol syndrome have facial abnormalities, including wide-set and narrow eyes, growth problems and nervous system abnormalities. Diagnosing FASD can be hard because there is no medical test, like a blood test, for it. The health care provider will make a diagnosis by looking at the child's signs and symptoms and asking whether the mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. FASDs last a lifetime. There is no cure for FASDs, but treatments can help. These include medicines to help with some symptoms, medical care for health problems, behavior and education therapy, and parent training. A good treatment plan is specific to the child's problems. It should include close monitoring, follow-ups, and changes when needed. Certain ""protective factors"" can help reduce the effects of FASDs and help people who have them reach their full potential. They include: Diagnosis before 6 years of age Loving, nurturing, and stable home environment during the school years Absence of violence around them Involvement in special education and social services There is no known safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy.

Studies of the brains of people with fibromyalgia found that they seem to process pain differently than people who don't have it. They may feel pain when others do not, and they may also have a more severe reaction to pain. Fibromyalgia can run in families, so genetics may also play a role. Other factors may also be involved, such as having certain diseases that cause pain. Who is at risk for fibromyalgia?

Fibromyalgia can be hard to diagnose. It sometimes takes visits to several different health care providers to get a diagnosis. One problem is that there isn't a specific test for it. And the main symptoms, pain and fatigue, are common in many other conditions. Providers have to rule out other causes of the symptoms before making a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. This is called making a differential diagnosis . To find out if you have fibromyalgia, your provider: Will take your medical history, including asking detailed questions about your symptoms Will do a physical exam May order x-rays and blood tests to rule out other conditions What are the treatments for fibromyalgia? Not all providers are familiar with fibromyalgia and its treatment. You should see a provider or team of providers who specialize in the treatment of fibromyalgia. There is no cure for fibromyalgia, so treatment focuses on relieving the symptoms. Providers usually use a combination of treatments, including medicines, lifestyle changes, talk therapy, and complementary therapies: Medicines Certain antidepressants and anti-seizure medicines, which may help with pain or sleep problems. Pain relievers . Lifestyle changes Getting enough sleep . Getting regular physical activity. If you have not already been active, start slowly and gradually increase how much activity you get. You may want to see a physical therapist, who can help you create a plan that is right for you. Learning how to manage stress . Learning to pace yourself. If you do too much, it can make your symptoms worse. So you need to learn to balance being active with your need for rest. Talk therapy , such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help you learn strategies to deal with pain, stress, and negative thoughts. If you also have depression along with your fibromyalgia, talk therapy can help with that too. Complementary therapies have helped some people with the symptoms of fibromyalgia. But researchers need to do more studies to show which ones are effective. You could consider trying them, but you should check with your provider first. These therapies include: Mindfulness meditation. Biofeedback, which uses electronic devices to measure body functions such as breathing and heart rate.

Fifth Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/fifthdisease.html,"What is fifth disease? Fifth disease, also called erythema infectiosum, is a viral infection caused by parvovirus B19. This virus only infects people; it's not the same type of parvovirus that dogs and cats can get. Fifth disease mostly affects children. It often causes a bright red rash on their cheeks (sometimes called a ""slapped cheek"" rash). In the United States, parvovirus B19 infections are more common in late winter, spring, and early summer. There are usually minor outbreaks of fifth disease about every 3 to 4 years. What causes fifth disease? Parvovirus B19, which causes fifth disease, can spread from person to person: Through respiratory droplets, such as saliva (spit), sputum, or nasal mucus. The droplets can spread when: Someone who has the virus coughs and sneezes You touch an item that has the virus on it Through blood or blood products From a pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy You are most contagious early in your infection, when you usually only have a fever or cold-like symptoms. You are not likely to be contagious after you get later symptoms such as a rash and joint pain. What are the symptoms of fifth disease? About 2 out of 10 people who get a B19 parvovirus infection will have no symptoms. But most people will get the symptoms of fifth disease, which are usually mild and can include: Fever Headache Cough Sore throat Rashes Joint pain The ""slapped cheek"" rash is more common in children. They usually get the rash a few days after they first have other symptoms. The rash can then spread to the arms, legs, chest, back, and buttocks. Adults who get fifth disease might also have joint pain and swelling (called polyarthropathy syndrome). Sometimes the infection can cause serious health complications affecting the nerves, joints, or blood system. This is more likely to happen if you are pregnant, have a blood disorder such as anemia , or a weakened immune system . Because of these risks to you and some possible risks to your baby, contact your health care provider if you are pregnant and: You show signs of fifth disease (or a ""slapped cheek"" rash) You may have been exposed to someone who has the infection How is fifth disease diagnosed? There is no routine lab test to diagnose fifth disease. Providers can often diagnose fifth disease just by seeing the ""slapped cheek"" rash and rashes on the body. There is testing to show whether or not you have protection (immunity) against the B19 parvovirus or if you have had a recent infection. This test is usually not needed, but your provider may order the test if you are pregnant or at higher risk for complications of the disease. What are the treatments for fifth disease? There is no specific treatment for fifth disease. It is usually mild and goes away on its own. To feel better, get plenty of rest. Taking acetaminophen can help with the fever and pain. Do not give aspirin to children, because it may cause Reye syndrome . This is a rare, serious illness that can affect the brain and liver. Can fifth disease be prevented? There is no vaccine to prevent fifth disease. But you can help protect yourself and others by: Washing your hands often with soap and water Covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Staying home when you are sick Most people become immune to the virus after having it once.

Flash floods, which can develop quickly, often have a dangerous wall of roaring water.  The wall carries rocks, mud, and rubble and can sweep away most things in its path. Be aware of flood hazards no matter where you live, but especially if you live in a low-lying area, near water or downstream from a dam.  Although there are no guarantees of safety during a flood, you can take actions to protect yourself.  You should have a disaster plan . Being prepared can help reduce fear, anxiety, and losses. If you do experience a disaster, it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope . Federal Emergency Management Agency",MedlinePlus
Flu,https://medlineplus.gov/flu.html,"What is the flu? The flu, also called influenza, is a respiratory infection caused by viruses. Each year, millions of Americans get sick with the flu. Sometimes it causes mild illness. But it can also be serious or even deadly, especially for people over 65, newborn babies, and people with certain chronic illnesses. What causes the flu? The flu is caused by flu viruses that spread from person to person. When someone with the flu coughs, sneezes, or talks, they spray tiny droplets. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person may get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. What are the symptoms of the flu? Symptoms of the flu come on suddenly and may include: Fever or feeling feverish/chills Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle or body aches Headaches Fatigue (tiredness) Some people may also have vomiting and diarrhea . This is more common in children. Sometimes people have trouble figuring out whether they have a cold or the flu. There are differences between them: Signs and Symptoms Cold Flu Start of symptoms Slowly Suddenly Fever Rarely Usually Aches Sometimes (slight) Usually Fatigue, weakness Sometimes Usually Headache Rarely Common Stuffy nose, sneezing, or sore throat Common Sometimes Sometimes people say that they have a ""flu"" when they really have something else. For example, ""stomach flu"" isn't the flu; it's gastroenteritis . What other problems can the flu cause? Some people who get the flu will develop complications. Some of these complications can be serious or even life-threatening. They include: Bronchitis Ear infection Sinus infection Pneumonia Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain ( encephalitis ), or muscle tissues ( myositis , rhabdomyolysis) The flu also can make chronic health problems worse. For example, people with asthma may have asthma attacks while they have flu. Certain people are more likely to have complications from the flu, including: Adults 65 and older Pregnant women Children younger than 5 People with certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease How is the flu diagnosed? To diagnose the flu, health care providers will first do a medical history and ask about your symptoms. There are several tests for the flu . For the tests, your provider will swipe the inside of your nose or the back of your throat with a swab. Then the swab will be tested for the flu virus. Some tests are quick and give results in 15-20 minutes. But these tests are not as accurate as other flu tests. These other tests can give you the results in one hour or several hours. What are the treatments for the flu? Most people with the flu recover on their own without medical care. People with mild cases of the flu should stay home and avoid contact with others, except to get medical care. But if you have symptoms of flu and are in a high risk group or are very sick or worried about your illness, contact your health care provider. You might need antiviral medicines to treat your flu. Antiviral medicines can make the illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious flu complications. They usually work best when you start taking them within 2 days of getting sick. Can the flu be prevented? The best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu vaccine every year. But it's also important to have good health habits like covering your cough and washing your hands often. This can help stop the spread of germs and prevent the flu.

Flu Shot,https://medlineplus.gov/flushot.html,"What is the flu? The flu (influenza) is a respiratory infection. It is caused by influenza viruses that infect your nose, throat, and lungs. These viruses can spread from person to person. Most people with the flu get better on their own, without medical care. But for some people, the flu is serious. It can cause complications and sometimes even death. People who are 65 and older, under age 5, pregnant, or have certain health conditions are at higher risk of flu complications. Getting vaccinated against the flu each year is best way to lower your risk of the flu and its complications. What are the benefits of getting a flu shot? There are many reasons to get a flu shot each year: It may keep you from getting sick with the flu. If you do get the flu, it may be less severe. You may also be less likely to have complications or need to be hospitalized with the flu. If you have certain chronic health conditions, getting a flu shot may help prevent the flu from making your condition worse. For example, if you have COPD or diabetes , the flu can worsen your condition so much that you might need to be hospitalized. Getting a flu shot can lower this risk. Getting the vaccine during pregnancy not only helps protect you from the flu during and after pregnancy. It also helps protect your baby from flu during their first few months of life. It has been shown to lower the risk of severe life-threatening flu in children. It may also protect the people around you, including those who are at higher risk of complications. How do flu shots work? The flu vaccine causes your immune system to make antibodies about two weeks after you get the shot. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the flu viruses that are in the vaccine. Who needs a flu shot? The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu shots for everyone 6 months and older, with a few rare exceptions. Flu shots are especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from the flu. There are different types of flu vaccines. There are injectable vaccines (shots) and nasal spray vaccines.  There are also some vaccines especially for people 65 and older. Ask your health care provider which one is right for you. Who should not get a flu shot? There are some people who should not get a flu shot: Children younger than 6 months of age. Have severe, life-threatening allergies to flu vaccine or any ingredient in the vaccine. This might include gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients. Some people need to talk to their provider before they get a flu shot. They include people who: Have an allergy to any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Have ever had Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). Some people with a history of GBS should not get a flu vaccine. If you are moderately or severely ill, you usually need to wait until you recover before getting a flu shot. Why do I need a flu shot every year? You need to get a flu shot every year because: Your immune protection from the vaccine declines over time. You need to get the shot every year to boost that protection. Flu viruses are constantly changing, so every year, the flu vaccine is updated. The flu vaccine will include protection against the viruses that will most likely be common during the upcoming flu season. When should I get the flu shot? For most people who need only one dose of the flu vaccine for the season, September and October are usually good times to get it. It's best to be vaccinated by the end of October. Some children need two doses of the flu vaccine. They should get their first dose as soon as the vaccine is available. They need to get the second dose at least four weeks after the first. If you are pregnant, talk to your provider about when to get the vaccine. When you should get it can vary, based on how far along you are in your pregnancy. Do flu shots cause side effects? Flu vaccines have been shown to be safe. But like any medical product, they can cause side effects. If you have any side effects, they are usually mild and go away on their own within a few days. Common side effects include: Soreness, redness, and/or swelling from the shot Headache Fever Nausea Muscle aches The flu shot, like other injections, can occasionally cause fainting . In rare cases, some people have a serious allergic reaction . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus
Fluid and Electrolyte Balance,https://medlineplus.gov/fluidandelectrolytebalance.html,"What are electrolytes? Electrolytes are minerals that have an electric charge when they are dissolved in water or body fluids, including blood. The electric charge can be positive or negative. You have electrolytes in your blood, urine (pee), tissues, and other body fluids. Electrolytes are important because they help: Balance the amount of water in your body Balance your body's acid/base (pH) level Move nutrients into your cells Move wastes out of your cells Support your muscle and nerve function Keep your heart rate and rhythm steady Keep your blood pressure stable Keep your bones and teeth healthy What are the different types of electrolytes in your body? The main electrolytes in your body include: Bicarbonate, which helps maintain the body's acid and base balance (pH). It also plays an important role in moving carbon dioxide through the bloodstream. Calcium , which helps make and keep bones and teeth strong. Chloride, which also helps control the amount of fluid in the body. In addition, it helps maintain healthy blood volume and blood pressure. Magnesium, which helps your muscles, nerves, and heart work properly. It also helps control blood pressure and blood glucose (blood sugar). Phosphate, which works together with calcium to build strong bones and teeth. Potassium , which helps your cells, heart, and muscles work properly. Sodium , which helps control the amount of fluid in the body. It also helps your nerves and muscles work properly. You get these electrolytes from the foods you eat and the fluids you drink. What is an electrolyte imbalance? An electrolyte imbalance means that the level of one or more electrolytes in your body is too low or too high. It can happen when the amount of water in your body changes. The amount of water that you take in should equal the amount you lose. If something upsets this balance, you may have too little water ( dehydration ) or too much water (overhydration). Some of the more common reasons why you might have an imbalance of the water in your body include: Certain medicines Severe vomiting and/or diarrhea Heavy sweating Heart , liver or kidney problems Not drinking enough fluids, especially when doing intense exercise or when the weather is very hot Drinking too much water What are the different types of electrolyte imbalances? The names of the different types of electrolyte imbalances are: Electrolyte Too low Too high Bicarbonate Acidosis Alkalosis Calcium Hypocalcemia Hypercalcemia Chloride Hypochloremia Hyperchloremia Magnesium Hypomagnesemia Hypermagnesemia Phosphate Hypophosphatemia Hyperphosphatemia Potassium Hypokalemia Hyperkalemia Sodium Hyponatremia Hypernatremia How are electrolyte imbalances diagnosed? A test called an electrolyte panel can check the levels of your body's main electrolytes. A related test, the anion gap blood test , checks whether your electrolytes are out of balance or if your blood is too acidic or not acidic enough. What are the treatments for electrolyte imbalances? The treatment for an electrolyte imbalance depends on which electrolytes are out of balance, if there is too little or too many, and what is causing the imbalance. In minor cases, you may just need to make some changes to your diet. In other cases, you may need other treatments. For example: If you don't have enough of an electrolyte, you may get electrolyte replacement therapy. This involves giving you more of that electrolyte. It could be a medicine or supplement that you swallow or drink, or it may be given intravenously (by IV). If you have too much of an electrolyte, your provider may give you medicines or fluids (by mouth or by IV) to help remove that electrolyte from your body. In severe cases, you may need dialysis to filter out the electrolyte.",MedlinePlus
Folic Acid,https://medlineplus.gov/folicacid.html,"Folic acid is a B vitamin . It helps the body make healthy new cells. Everyone needs folic acid.

Food Allergy,https://medlineplus.gov/foodallergy.html,"What is a food allergy? A food allergy is an abnormal immune system reaction to certain foods. Your immune system normally protects you from germs. But if you have a food allergy, your immune system mistakenly reacts to certain foods as if they were harmful. This reaction is usually mild. But in some cases, it can be serious or even life-threatening. A food intolerance is different than a food allergy. If you have a food intolerance, you also have symptoms when you eat that food. But these are typically just digestive symptoms such as bloating and gas . Also, an intolerance is not an immune system reaction. Most food allergies are caused by: Cow's milk Chicken eggs Crustacean shellfish, such as shrimp, crab, lobster, and crayfish Fish Peanuts Sesame Soy Tree nuts, such as almonds, walnuts, pecans Wheat People with a food allergy may be allergic to more than one type of food. Who is more likely to develop a food allergy? Both children and adults can have food allergies. Some children will outgrow their food allergies. And sometimes people can develop food allergies as adult. Certain factors can make you more likely to have a food allergy. They include: Having eczema , a disease that causes inflammation, redness, and irritation of the skin. Your immune system also plays a role in eczema. Having asthma or other allergies , such as hay fever . Your genes. Certain genes may influence the development of food allergies. And you are more likely to have food allergies if someone in your family has allergies, asthma, or eczema. What are the symptoms of food allergies? If you are allergic to a food you have eaten, you may have a variety of symptoms. These symptoms are not always the same for every person. And the symptoms that you get each time you eat the food may not always be the same. For example, your symptoms may sometimes depend on how much of the food you ate. Food allergy symptoms usually start within a few minutes to two hours after you eat that food. They may include: Hives Flushed skin or rash Tingling or itchy sensation in the mouth Face, tongue, or lip swelling Vomiting and/or diarrhea Abdominal (belly) cramps Coughing or wheezing Dizziness and/or lightheadedness Swelling of the throat and vocal cords Trouble breathing In rare cases, a food allergy can cause a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis . It may start out with some milder symptoms, but then it becomes more serious. It can lead to: Narrowed airways in the lungs Severe trouble breathing because of swelling in the throat Severe lowering of blood pressure and shock (""anaphylactic shock"") Loss of consciousness This is a medical emergency. Call 911 if someone is having the symptoms of anaphylaxis. How are food allergies diagnosed? To find out if you have a food allergy, your health care provider will Ask about your symptoms, family health history, and medical history, including other allergies. Likely do a physical exam. Do food allergy testing . This could involve skin testing, blood testing, a food elimination diet, and/or an oral food challenge test. An oral food challenge test is the most accurate food allergy test. What are the treatments for food allergies? There is no cure for food allergies. The only way to prevent a reaction is to avoid eating the food that you are allergic to. There are medicines for people with food allergies. They include: Medicines to reduce food allergy symptoms, including antihistamines and corticosteroids . Medicines to reduce allergic reactions, including severe reactions. Epinephrine, a medicine to treat anaphylaxis. Your provider may give you a prescription for an epinephrine auto-injector. It is a device used to inject epinephrine when someone is having symptoms of anaphylaxis. If you have been prescribed one, it's important to learn how to use it and to carry it with you at all times.

Food Labeling,https://medlineplus.gov/foodlabeling.html,"All packaged foods and beverages in the United States have food labels. These ""Nutrition Facts"" labels can help you make smarter food choices and eat a healthy diet. Before you read the food label, you should know a few things: Serving size is based on how much people usually eat and drink at one time Number of servings tells you how many servings are in the container. Some labels will give you information about calories and nutrients for both the whole package and each serving size. But many labels just tell you that information for each serving size. You need to think about the serving size when you decide how much to eat or drink. For example, if a bottle of juice has two servings and you drink the whole bottle, then you are getting twice the amount of sugar that is listed on the label. Percent daily value (%DV) is a number that helps you understand how much of a nutrient is in one serving. Experts recommend that you get a certain amount of different nutrients daily. %DV tells you what percentage of the daily recommendation you get from one serving of a food. With this, you can figure out if a food is high or low in a nutrient: 5% or less is low, 20% or more is high. The information on a food label can help you see how a certain food or drink fits into your overall diet.

Since they can sometimes be serious, it's important to get medical care right away if you think you have a fracture. What are the different types of fractures? There are different ways to describe fractures. For example, there are different types of fractures based on: Whether the bone is partially or completely broken. Whether the bone breaks through the skin; if it does, it's called an open (or compound) fracture. If not, it's a closed fracture. The direction or shape of the break, for example if it's in a line across the bone or if it has some kind of pattern. The cause of the break. For example, a stress fracture is a small break in a bone that is often caused by overuse. Which bone is broken, for example facial fractures include nose and jaw fractures. What causes fractures? Fractures commonly happen because of car accidents, falls , or sports injuries . Overuse and repetitive motions can also cause fractures. Low bone density and osteoporosis are conditions which cause weakening of your bones. Having one of these conditions makes you much more likely to break a bone. What are the symptoms of a fracture? The symptoms of a fracture can vary, depending on which bone you broke. But they may include: Intense pain Deformity, for example a limb that looks out of place Swelling, bruising, or tenderness around the injury Trouble moving the injured part If you think that you may have broken a bone, get medical care right away. How are fractures diagnosed? To find out if you have a fracture, your health provider will do a physical exam and ask about your injury. They will also likely order an x-ray or other imaging test to see if your bone is broken. What are the treatments for fractures? The most common treatment for a fracture is for you to wear a cast or a splint. This will keep your bone from moving while it heals. How long you need to wear it will depend on the type of fracture and which bone is affected. But it's often for several weeks. Your provider will let you know when you can get it off.

You could be infected when you touch something that has the germs on it and then touch your eyes, mouth, or nose. What are the symptoms of gastroenteritis? The symptoms of gastroenteritis include: Diarrhea Pain or cramping in your abdomen (belly) Nausea Vomiting Sometimes fever Gastroenteritis is usually not serious. But it can sometimes cause lead to dehydration or cause severe symptoms. Certain people are at higher risk for these problems. They include: Pregnant women Older adults People with weakened immune systems or other serious health conditions Infants Babies who were born prematurely or have other health conditions If you or a family member are at higher risk and have symptoms of gastroenteritis, contact a health care provider right away.
Even if you are not at high risk, it is possible to become dehydrated or have more serious symptoms. There are some warning signs to watch for. It's important to contact a provider right away if you or your child have any of them: For adults, they include: Change in mental state, such as irritability or lack of energy Diarrhea lasting more than 2 days High fever Vomiting often Six or more loose stools in a day Severe pain in the abdomen (belly) or rectum Stools that are black and tarry or contain blood or pus Symptoms of dehydration, such as thirst, dry mouth , headache, dark-colored urine, and urinating less than normal For infants and children, they include: Change in the child's mental state, such as irritability or lack of energy Diarrhea lasting more than a day Any fever in infants High fever in older children Frequent loose stools Vomiting often Severe pain in the abdomen (belly) or rectum Signs or symptoms of dehydration, such as thirst, dry mouth, urinating less than usual or no wet diapers for 3 hours or more, and no tears when crying Stools that are black and tarry or contain blood or pus How is gastroenteritis diagnosed? To find out if you have gastroenteritis, your provider: Will do a physical exam Will ask about your symptoms May do tests of your stool What are the treatments for gastroenteritis? Usually, people with gastroenteritis get better on their own, with rest and plenty of fluids and electrolytes . Your provider may suggest that you take a probiotic. Studies suggest that some probiotics may help shorten a case of diarrhea. People with more severe symptoms may need medicines to control nausea or vomiting. Providers may also give other medicines for certain types of gastroenteritis, such as antibiotics for some bacterial types and antiparasitic medicines for some parasitic types. Can gastroenteritis be prevented? Gastroenteritis cannot always be prevented. But proper hand washing , cleaning surfaces that may be infected with germs, and safe food preparation may help prevent some of the infections that can cause gastroenteritis. There are vaccines for infants to protect against rotavirus infections. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",MedlinePlus
Gastrointestinal Bleeding,https://medlineplus.gov/gastrointestinalbleeding.html,"Your digestive or gastrointestinal (GI) tract includes the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine or colon, rectum, and anus. Bleeding can come from any of these areas. The amount of bleeding can be so small that only a lab test can find it. Signs of bleeding in the digestive tract depend on where it is and how much bleeding there is. Signs of bleeding in the upper digestive tract include: Bright red blood in vomit Vomit that looks like coffee grounds Black or tarry stool Dark blood mixed with stool Signs of bleeding in the lower digestive tract include: Black or tarry stool Dark blood mixed with stool Stool mixed or coated with bright red blood GI bleeding is not a disease, but a symptom of a disease. There are many possible causes of GI bleeding, including hemorrhoids , peptic ulcers , tears or inflammation in the esophagus, diverticulosis and diverticulitis , ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease , colonic polyps , or cancer in the colon , stomach or esophagus . The test used most often to look for the cause of GI bleeding is called endoscopy . It uses a flexible instrument inserted through the mouth or rectum to view the inside of the GI tract.

Gaucher Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/gaucherdisease.html,"Gaucher disease is a rare, inherited disorder. It is a type of lipid metabolism disorder . If you have it, you do not have enough of an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase.  This causes too much of a fatty substance to build up in your spleen, liver, lungs, bones and, sometimes, your brain. This prevents these organs from working properly. There are three types: Type 1, the most common form, causes liver and spleen enlargement, bone pain and fractures (broken bones), and, sometimes, lung and kidney problems. It does not affect the brain. It can occur at any age. Type 2, which causes severe brain damage, appears in infants. Most children who have it die by age 2. In type 3, there may be liver and spleen enlargement. The brain is gradually affected. It usually starts in childhood or adolescence. Gaucher disease has no cure. Treatment options for types 1 and 3 include medicine and enzyme replacement therapy, which is usually very effective. There is no good treatment for the brain damage of types 2 and 3.

A mutation is a change in a gene. Genetic brain disorders affect the development and function of the brain. Some genetic brain disorders are due to random gene mutations or mutations caused by environmental exposure, such as cigarette smoke. Other disorders are inherited, which means that a mutated gene or group of genes is passed down through a family. They can also be due to a combination of both genetic changes and other outside factors. Some examples of genetic brain disorders include: Leukodystrophies Phenylketonuria Tay-Sachs disease Wilson disease Many people with genetic brain disorders fail to produce enough of certain proteins that influence brain development and function.

Genetic Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/geneticdisorders.html,"Genes are the building blocks of heredity. They are passed from parent to child. They hold DNA, the instructions for making proteins. Proteins do most of the work in cells. They move molecules from one place to another, build structures, break down toxins, and do many other maintenance jobs. Sometimes there is a mutation, a change in a gene or genes.  The mutation changes the gene's instructions for making a protein, so the protein does not work properly or is missing entirely. This can cause a medical condition called a genetic disorder. You can inherit a gene mutation from one or both parents.  A mutation can also happen during your lifetime. There are three types of genetic disorders: Single-gene disorders, where a mutation affects one gene.  Sickle cell anemia is an example. Chromosomal disorders, where chromosomes (or parts of chromosomes) are missing or changed. Chromosomes are the structures that hold our genes.  Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder. Complex disorders, where there are mutations in two or more genes. Often your lifestyle and environment also play a role.  Colon cancer is an example. Genetic tests on blood and other tissue can identify genetic disorders. NIH: National Library of Medicine",MedlinePlus
Genetic Testing,https://medlineplus.gov/genetictesting.html,"What is genetic testing? Genetic testing is a type of medical test that looks for changes in your DNA. DNA is short for deoxyribonucleic acid. It contains the genetic instructions in all living things. Genetic tests analyze your cells or tissue to look for any changes in: Genes , which are parts of DNA that carry the information needed to make a protein Chromosomes , which are thread-like structures in your cells. They contain DNA and proteins. Proteins , which do most of the work in your cells.  Testing can look for changes in the amount and activity level of proteins. If it finds changes, it might be due to changes in your DNA. Why is genetic testing done? Genetic testing may be done for many different reasons, including to: Find genetic diseases in unborn babies. This is one type of prenatal testing . Screen newborn babies for certain treatable conditions Lower the risk of genetic diseases in embryos that were created using assisted reproductive technology Find out if you carry a gene for a certain disease that could be passed on to your children. This is called carrier testing. See whether you are at increased risk of developing a specific disease. This may be done for a disease that runs in your family. Diagnose certain diseases Identify genetic changes that may be causing or contributing to a disease that you were already diagnosed with Figure out how severe a disease is Help guide your doctor in deciding the best medicine and dosage for you. This is called pharmacogenomic testing . How is genetic testing done? Genetic tests are often done on a blood or cheek swab sample. But they may also be done on samples of hair, saliva, skin, amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds a fetus during pregnancy), or other tissue. The sample is sent to a laboratory. There, a lab technician will use one of several different techniques to look for genetic changes. What are the benefits of genetic testing? The benefits of genetic testing include: Helping doctors make recommendations for treatment or monitoring Giving you more information for making decisions about your health and your family's health: If you find out that you are at risk for a certain disease, you might take steps to lower that risk. For example, you may find out that you should be screened for a disease earlier and more often. Or you might decide to make healthy lifestyle changes . If you find out that you are not at risk for a certain disease, then you can skip unnecessary checkups or screenings A test could give you information that helps you make decisions about having children Identifying genetic disorders early in life so treatment can be started as soon as possible What are the drawbacks of genetic testing? The physical risks of the different types of genetic testing are small. But there can be emotional, social, or financial drawbacks: Depending on the results, you may feel angry, depressed, anxious, or guilty. This can be especially true if you are diagnosed with a disease that does not have effective treatments. You may be worried about genetic discrimination in employment or insurance Genetic testing may give you limited information about a genetic disease. For example, it cannot tell you whether you will have symptoms, how severe a disease might be, or whether a disease will get worse over time. Some genetic tests are expensive, and health insurance might only cover part of the cost. Or they may not cover it at all. How do I decide whether to be tested? The decision about whether to have genetic testing is complex. In addition to discussing the test with your health care provider, you can meet with a genetic counselor . Genetic counselors have specialized degrees and experience in genetics and counseling. They can help you understand the tests and weigh the risks and benefits. If you do get a test, they can explain the results and make sure that you have the support that you need.",MedlinePlus

There are different types of glaucoma, but the most common type is open-angle glaucoma. Other less common types include angle-closure glaucoma, and congenital glaucoma. You may not have any symptoms of glaucoma. Regular eye exams by an eye care provider can check for glaucoma and other eye problems to help protect your vision. Treatments that lower eye pressure help slow the disease. Without treatment, glaucoma can eventually lead to blindness. What causes glaucoma? Medical experts aren't sure what causes glaucoma, but the most common types usually happen when the fluid pressure inside your eye slowly rises, damaging the optic nerve. Other types of glaucoma may be caused by medical conditions, or a baby may be born with it. Not everyone with high eye pressure develops glaucoma. Some people may even get glaucoma with normal eye pressure. The amount of pressure your optic nerve can handle is different for each person. Getting regular dilated eye exams helps your provider figure out what level of eye pressure is normal for you. What are the symptoms of glaucoma? Often there are no symptoms of glaucoma at first. Or symptoms may start so slowly that you may not notice them. Without treatment, you slowly lose your peripheral (side) vision. It may seem like you're looking through a tunnel. Over time, your straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains. If you have sudden symptoms of intense eye pain, blurry vision, red eyes, or an upset stomach (nausea), you need to go to your eye care provider or an emergency room right away. These could be symptoms of angle-closure glaucoma. This less common type of glaucoma causes fluid to build up quickly in your eye. How is glaucoma diagnosed? A comprehensive eye exam can tell if you have glaucoma. This would include: A dilated eye exam . This involves getting eye drops that dilate (widen) your pupils. This allows more light to enter your eye. Your eye care provider examines your eyes using a special magnifying lens. This provides a clear view of important tissues at the back of your eye to check for glaucoma or other eye problems. For a few hours after the exam your vision may be blurry and sensitive to light, so you will need someone to take you home. Visual field testing . This check of your peripheral (side) vision allows your eye care provider to find out how well you can see objects off to the side of your vision without moving your eyes. Tonometry . This measures the pressure inside your eye. If you're at higher risk for glaucoma, you should get comprehensive eye exams every one to two years. You're at higher risk if you: Are Black or African American and over age 40 Are over age 60, especially if you're Hispanic or Latino Have a family history of glaucoma You're also at higher risk if you have high blood pressure or diabetes and should get a dilated eye exam at least once a year. Talk with your provider about your risk and how often you should get your eyes checked. What are the treatments for glaucoma? Early treatment can help protect your eyes against vision loss. There is no cure, but glaucoma can usually be controlled. Without treatment it can eventually cause blindness. Treatments can include: Prescription eye drops are the most common treatment to lower the pressure in your eye and prevent damage to your optic nerve. Other treatments may include oral medicines, laser treatment, and/or surgery. A combination of these treatments may be used to lower eye pressure and help drain the fluid out of your eye. Can glaucoma be prevented? There is no way to prevent glaucoma. Eye exams can help find glaucoma or other eye problems before they can affect your vision. If you have glaucoma, be sure to continue with treatment to prevent your vision from getting worse. NIH: National Eye Institute",MedlinePlus

Gout,https://medlineplus.gov/gout.html,"What is gout? Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis . It causes pain, swelling, and redness in one or more joints. It usually happens as a flare, which can last for a week or two and then gets better. The flares often begin in your big toe or a lower limb. What causes gout? Gout happens when too much uric acid (urate) builds up in your body over a long time. Uric acid is a waste product your body makes when it breaks down purines. Purines are substances that are in your body's tissues and in many foods. When your body breaks down old cells or digests foods that contain purine, most of the uric acid that's made dissolves in your blood. Your kidneys filter the uric acid out of your blood, and it leaves your body in your urine (pee). However, sometimes your body can make too much uric acid or does not remove enough of it. Then the uric acid levels build up in your body, including in your blood. Having too much uric acid in the blood is called hyperuricemia. It does not cause health problems for everyone. But in some people, uric acid forms needle-like crystals. They can form in your joints, which causes gout. The crystals can also cause kidney stones . Calcium pyrophosphate arthritis, sometimes called pseudogout, is a related disease. It causes similar symptoms and is sometimes confused with gout. But it is caused by a buildup of calcium phosphate, not uric acid. Who is more likely to develop gout? Many people develop gout. You are more likely to get it if you: Are male. Are older; it usually develops in middle age. Have obesity . Have certain health conditions, such as: Heart failure High blood pressure Metabolic syndrome Chronic kidney disease Conditions that cause your cells to break down more quickly, such as psoriasis or some cancers Rare genetic conditions that lead to increased uric acid Have a family history of gout. Have an unhealthy diet and eat foods that are rich in purines, such as red meat, organ meats, certain seafoods. Drink alcohol. Eat and drink lots of foods and beverages that contain fructose (a type of sugar). Take certain medicines, such as diuretics (water pills), low-dose aspirin, and some medicines that weaken your immune system. Take high amounts of niacin (vitamin B-3). What are the symptoms of gout? Gout usually happens in only one joint at a time. It is often found in the big toe, but can also affect other joints, including your other toes, ankle, and knee. Gout flares often start suddenly at night, and the symptoms in the affected joint often include: Intense pain, which may be bad enough to wake you up Swelling Redness Warmth The flares typically get better within a week or two. In between flares, you usually don't have symptoms. Some people may have flares often, while others may not have another flare for years. But over time, if left untreated, your flares may happen more often and last longer. And if gout is untreated over long periods of time, you can develop tophi. Tophi are hard, uric acid deposits under the skin. They start out as painless, but over time, they can become painful. They can also cause bone and soft tissue damage and misshapen joints. How is gout diagnosed? To find out if you have gout, your health care provider: Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. Will do a physical exam, including examining the affected joint(s). May order various tests, such as: A test of a sample of fluid from one of your painful joints. The fluid is examined under a microscope and is checked for uric acid crystals. A uric acid blood or urine test . An ultrasound or special CT scan to look for uric acid crystal buildup in the affected joint and check for other conditions that may be causing the symptoms. What are the treatments for gout? There are effective treatments for gout. Which treatment you get will depend on your symptoms and the cause of your gout. The goals of your treatment will be to: Reduce the pain from gout flares, by using medicines such as: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen. Acetaminophen and the anti-inflammatory drug colchicine. Oral or injected corticosteroids . Prevent future flares, for example by: Making lifestyle changes such as losing weight, limiting alcohol, and avoiding foods high in purines. If you are taking medicines that can cause high uric acid in the blood, your provider may suggest stopping or changing those medicines. If needed, taking medicines to lower uric acid in the blood. Prevent tophi and kidney stones, for example with medicines that lower uric acid in the blood. With early diagnosis, treatment, and lifestyle changes, gout is one of the most controllable forms of arthritis. Treatment and lifestyle changes may help people avoid gout flares, lessen their symptoms, and sometimes even become gout free.

Growth disorders are problems that prevent children from developing normal height, weight, sexual maturity or other features. Very slow or very fast growth can sometimes signal a gland problem or disease. The pituitary gland makes growth hormone, which stimulates the growth of bone and other tissues. Children who have too little of it may be very short. Treatment with growth hormone can stimulate growth. People can also have too much growth hormone.  Usually the cause is a pituitary gland tumor, which is not cancer.  Too much growth hormone can cause gigantism in children, where their bones and their body grow too much.

What is posture? Posture is how you hold your body. There are two types: Dynamic posture is how you hold yourself when you are moving, like when you are walking, running, or bending over to pick up something. Static posture is how you hold yourself when you are not moving, like when you are sitting, standing, or sleeping. It is important to make sure that you have good dynamic and static posture. The key to good posture is the position of your spine. Your spine has three natural curves - at your neck, mid back, and low back. Correct posture should maintain these curves, but not increase them. Your head should be above your shoulders, and the top of your shoulder should be over the hips. How can posture affect my health? Poor posture can be bad for your health. Slouching or slumping over can: Misalign your musculoskeletal system Wear away at your spine, making it more fragile and prone to injury Cause neck, shoulder, and back pain Decrease your flexibility Affect how well your joints move Affect your balance and increase your risk of falling Make it harder to digest your food Make it harder to breathe How can I improve my posture in general? Be mindful of your posture during everyday activities, like watching television, washing dishes, or walking Stay active. Any kind of exercise may help improve your posture, but certain types of exercises can be especially helpful. They include yoga, tai chi, and other classes that focus on body awareness. It is also a good idea to do exercises that strengthen your core (muscles around your back, abdomen, and pelvis). Maintain a healthy weight. Extra weight can weaken your abdominal muscles, cause problems for your pelvis and spine, and contribute to low back pain. All of these can hurt your posture. Wear comfortable, low-heeled shoes. High heels, for example, can throw off your balance and force you to walk differently. This puts more stress on your muscles and harms your posture. Make sure work surfaces are at a comfortable height for you, whether you're sitting in front of a computer, making dinner, or eating a meal. How can I improve my posture when sitting? Many Americans spend a lot of their time sitting - either at work, at school, or at home. It is important to sit properly, and to take frequent breaks: Switch sitting positions often Take brief walks around your office or home Gently stretch your muscles every so often to help relieve muscle tension Don't cross your legs; keep your feet on the floor, with your ankles in front of your knees Make sure that your feet touch the floor, or if that's not possible, use a footrest Relax your shoulders; they should not be rounded or pulled backwards Keep your elbows in close to your body. They should be bent between 90 and 120 degrees. Make sure that your back is fully supported. Use a back pillow or other back support if your chair does not have a backrest that can support your lower back's curve. Make sure that your thighs and hips are supported. You should have a well-padded seat, and your thighs and hips should be parallel to the floor. How can I improve my posture when standing? Stand up straight and tall Keep your shoulders back Pull your stomach in Put your weight mostly on the balls of your feet Keep your head level Let your arms hang down naturally at your sides Keep your feet about shoulder-width apart With practice, you can improve your posture; you will look and feel better.",MedlinePlus
Guillain-Barre Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/guillainbarresyndrome.html,"Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare disorder that causes your immune system to attack your peripheral nervous system (PNS). The PNS nerves connect your brain and spinal cord with the rest of your body. Damage to these nerves makes it hard for them to transmit signals. As a result, your muscles have trouble responding to your brain. No one knows what causes the syndrome. Sometimes it is triggered by an infection, surgery, or a vaccination. The first symptom is usually weakness or a tingling feeling in your legs. The feeling can spread to your upper body. In severe cases, you become almost paralyzed. This is life-threatening. You might need a respirator to breathe. Symptoms usually worsen over a period of weeks and then stabilize. Guillain-Barre can be hard to diagnose.  Possible tests include nerve tests and a spinal tap. Most people recover. Recovery can take a few weeks to a few years. Treatment can help symptoms, and may include medicines or a procedure called plasma exchange. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",MedlinePlus

"HDL: The ""Good"" Cholesterol",https://medlineplus.gov/hdlthegoodcholesterol.html,"What is cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But having too much cholesterol in your blood raises your risk of coronary artery disease . What are HDL and LDL? HDL and LDL are two types of lipoproteins.They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein.  The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. HDL and LDL have different purposes: HDL stands for high-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the ""good"" cholesterol because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body. LDL stands for low-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the ""bad"" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. How do I know what my HDL level is? A blood test can measure your cholesterol levels, including HDL. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history.  The general recommendations are: For people who are age 19 or younger: : The first test should be between ages 9 to 11 Children should have the test again every 5 years Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke For people who are age 20 or older: : Younger adults should have the test every 5 years Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years What should my HDL level be? With HDL cholesterol, higher numbers are better, because a high HDL level can lower your risk for coronary artery disease and stroke . How high your HDL should be depends on your age and sex: Group Healthy HDL Level Age 19 or younger More than 45mg/dl Men age 20 or older More than 40mg/dl Women age 20 or older More than 50mg/dl How can I raise my HDL level? If your HDL level is too low, lifestyle changes may help. These changes may also help prevent other diseases, and make you feel better overall: Eat a healthy diet. To raise your HDL level, you need to eat good fats instead of bad fats. This means limiting saturated fats, which include full-fat milk and cheese, high-fat meats like sausage and bacon, and foods made with butter, lard, and shortening. You should also avoid trans fats, which may be in some margarines, fried foods, and processed foods like baked goods. Instead, eat unsaturated fats, which are found in avocado, vegetable oils like olive oil, and nuts. Limit carbohydrates, especially sugar. Also try to eat more foods naturally high in fiber, such as oatmeal and beans. Stay at a healthy weight. You can boost your HDL level by losing weight, especially if you have lots of fat around your waist. Exercise. Getting regular exercise can raise your HDL level, as well as lower your LDL. You should try to do 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise on most, if not all, days. Avoid cigarettes. Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke can lower your HDL level. If you are a smoker, ask your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit . You should also try to avoid secondhand smoke. Limit alcohol. Moderate alcohol may lower your HDL level, although more studies are needed to confirm that. What we do know is that too much alcohol can make you gain weight, and that lowers your HDL level. Some cholesterol medicines , including certain statins , can raise your HDL level, in addition to lowering your LDL level. Health care providers don't usually prescribe medicines only to raise HDL. But if you have a low HDL and high LDL level, you might need medicine. What else can affect my HDL level? Taking certain medicines can lower HDL levels in some people. They include: Beta blockers, a type of blood pressure medicine Anabolic steroids , including testosterone, a male hormone Progestins, which are female hormones that are in some birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy Benzodiazepines, sedatives that are often used for anxiety and insomnia If you are taking one of these and you have a very low HDL level, ask your provider if you should continue to take them. Diabetes can also lower your HDL level, so that gives you another reason to manage your diabetes .",MedlinePlus

Head Injuries,https://medlineplus.gov/headinjuries.html,"Chances are you've bumped your head before.  Often, the injury is minor because your skull is hard and it protects your brain.  But other head injuries can be more severe, such as a skull fracture, concussion , or traumatic brain injury . Head injuries can be open or closed.  A closed injury does not break through the skull.  With an open, or penetrating, injury, an object pierces the skull and enters the brain.  Closed injuries are not always less severe than open injuries. Some common causes of head injuries are falls , motor vehicle accidents , violence, and sports injuries . It is important to know the warning signs of a moderate or severe head injury.

Head Lice,https://medlineplus.gov/headlice.html,"What are head lice? Head lice are tiny insects that live on people's heads. Adult lice are about the size of sesame seeds. The eggs, called nits, are even smaller - about the size of a dandruff flake. Lice and nits are found on or near the scalp, most often at the neckline and behind the ears. Head lice are parasites, and they need to feed on human blood to survive. They are one of the three types of lice that live on humans. The other two types are body lice and pubic lice . Each type of lice is different, and getting one type does not mean that you will get another type. How do head lice spread? Lice move by crawling, because they cannot hop or fly. They spread by close person-to-person contact. Rarely, they can spread through sharing personal belongings such as hats or hairbrushes. Personal hygiene and cleanliness have nothing to do with getting head lice. You also cannot get pubic lice from animals. Head lice do not spread disease. Who is at risk for head lice? Children ages 3-11 and their families get head lice most often. This is because young children often have head-to-head contact while playing together. What are the symptoms of head lice? The symptoms of head lice include: Tickling feeling in the hair Frequent itching, which is caused by an allergic reaction to the bites Sores from scratching. Sometimes the sores can become infected with bacteria. Trouble sleeping, because head lice are most active in the dark How do you know if you have head lice? A diagnosis of head lice usually comes from seeing a louse or nit. Because they are very small and move quickly, you may need to use a magnifying lens and a fine-toothed comb to find lice or nits. What are the treatments for head lice? Treatments for head lice include both over-the-counter and prescription shampoos, creams, and lotions. If you want to use an over-the-counter treatment and you aren't sure which one to use or how to use one, ask your health care provider or pharmacist. You should also check with your health care provider first if you are pregnant or nursing, or if you want to use a treatment on a young child. Follow these steps when using a head lice treatment: Apply the product according to the instructions. Only apply it to the scalp and the hair attached to the scalp. You should not use it on other body hair. Use only one product at a time, unless your health care provider tells you to use two different kinds at once Pay attention to what the instructions say about how long you should leave the medicine on the hair and on how you should rinse it out After rinsing, use a fine-toothed comb or special ""nit comb"" to remove dead lice and nits After each treatment, check your hair for lice and nits.  You should comb your hair to remove nits and lice every 2-3 days. Do this for 2-3 weeks to be sure that all lice and nits are gone. All household members and other close contacts should be checked and treated if necessary. If an over-the-counter treatment does not work for you, you can ask your health care provider for a prescription product. Can head lice be prevented? There are steps you can take to prevent the spread of lice. If you already have lice, besides treatment, you should: Wash your clothes, bedding, and towels with hot water, and dry them using the hot cycle of the dryer Soak your combs and brushes in hot water for 5-10 minutes Vacuum the floor and furniture, particularly where you sat or lay If there are items that you cannot wash, seal them in a plastic bag for two weeks To prevent your children from spreading lice: Teach children to avoid head-to-head contact during play and other activities Teach children not to share clothing and other items that they put on their head, such as headphones, hair ties, and helmets If your child has lice, be sure to check the policies at school and/or daycare. Your child may not be able to go back until the lice have been completely treated.

You also should not use kerosene or gasoline; they are dangerous and flammable. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus

You can keep adding more exercise gradually. The more you can do, the better. But try not to feel overwhelmed, and do what you can. Getting some exercise is always better than getting none. Eventually, your goal can be to get the recommended amount of exercise for your age and health. There are many different ways to get exercise; it is important to find the types that are best for you . You can also try to add activity to your life in smaller ways, such as at home and at work. How can I be more active around the house? There are some ways you can be active around your house: Housework, gardening, and yard work are all physical work. To increase the intensity, you could try doing them at a more vigorous pace. Keep moving while you watch TV. Lift hand weights, do some gentle yoga stretches, or pedal an exercise bike. Instead of using the TV remote, get up and change the channels yourself. Work out at home with a workout video (on your TV or on the internet) Go for a walk in your neighborhood. It can be more fun if you walk your dog, walk your kids to school, or walk with a friend. Stand up when talking on the phone Get some exercise equipment for your home.

Less expensive equipment such as yoga balls, exercise mats, stretch bands, and hand weights can help you get a workout at home too. How can I be more active at work? Most of us sit when we are working, often in front of a computer. In fact, less than 20% of Americans have physically active jobs. It can be challenging to fit physical activity into your busy workday, but here are some tips to help you get moving: Get up from your chair and move around at least once an hour Stand when you are talking on the phone Find out whether your company can get you a stand-up or treadmill desk Take the stairs instead of the elevator Use your break or part of your lunch hour to walk around the building Stand up and walk to a colleague's office instead of sending an email Have ""walking"" or standing meetings with co-workers instead of sitting in a conference room",MedlinePlus
Health Screening,https://medlineplus.gov/healthscreening.html,"Screenings are tests that look for diseases before you have symptoms. Screening tests can find diseases early, when they're easier to treat. You can get some screenings in your doctor's office. Others need special equipment, so you may need to go to a different office or clinic. Some conditions that doctors commonly screen for include: Breast cancer and cervical cancer in women Colorectal cancer Diabetes High blood pressure High cholesterol Osteoporosis Overweight and obesity Prostate cancer in men Which tests you need depends on your age, your sex, your family history, and whether you have risk factors for certain diseases.  After a screening test, ask when you will get the results and whom to talk to about them. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality",MedlinePlus
Health Statistics,https://medlineplus.gov/healthstatistics.html,"Health statistics are numbers that summarize information related to health. Researchers and experts from government, private, and non-profit agencies and organizations collect health statistics. They use the statistics to learn about public health and health care. Some of the types of statistics include: How many people in the country have a disease or how many people got the disease within a certain period of time How many people of a certain group have a disease. The groups could be based on location, race, ethnic group, sex, age, profession, income level, or level of education. This can help identify health disparities . Whether a treatment is safe and effective How many people were born and died. These are known as vital statistics.

Healthy Sleep,https://medlineplus.gov/healthysleep.html,"What is sleep? While you are sleeping, you are unconscious, but your brain and body functions are still active. Sleep is a complex biological process that helps you process new information, stay healthy, and feel rested. During sleep, your brain cycles through five stages: stage 1, 2, 3, 4, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Different things happen during each stage. For example, you have a different pattern of brain waves during each one. Your breathing, heart, and temperature may be slower or faster in some stages. Certain phases of sleep help you : Feel rested and energetic the next day Learn information, get insight, and form memories Give your heart and vascular system a rest Release more growth hormone, which helps children grow. It also boosts muscle mass and the repair of cells and tissues in children and adults. Release sex hormones, which contributes to puberty and fertility Keep from getting sick or help you get better when you are sick, by creating more cytokines (hormones that help the immune system fight various infections) You need all of the stages to get a healthy sleep. How much sleep do I need? The amount of sleep you need depends on several factors, including your age, lifestyle, health, and whether you have been getting enough sleep recently. The general recommendations for sleep are: Newborns: 16-18 hours a day Preschool-aged children: 11-12 hours a day School-aged children: At least 10 hours a day Teens: 9-10 hours a day Adults (including older adults): 7-8 hours a day During puberty, teenagers' biological clocks shift, and they are more likely to go to bed later than younger children and adults, and they tend to want to sleep later in the morning. This delayed sleep-wake rhythm conflicts with the early-morning start times of many high schools and helps explain why most teenagers do not get enough sleep. Some people think that adults need less sleep as they age. But there is no evidence to show that older adults can get by with less sleep than people who are younger. As people age, however, they often get less sleep or they tend to spend less time in the deep, restful stage of sleep. Older adults are also more easily awakened. And it's not just the number of hours of sleep you get that matters. The quality of the sleep you get is also important. People whose sleep is frequently interrupted or cut short might not get enough of certain stages of sleep. If you are wondering whether you are getting enough sleep, including quality sleep, ask yourself: Do you have trouble getting up in the morning? Do you have trouble focusing during the day? Do you doze off during the day? If you answered yes to these three questions, you should work on improving your sleep. What are the health effects of not getting enough sleep? Sleep is important for overall health. When you don't get enough sleep (sleep deprivation), it does more than just make you feel tired. It can affect your performance, including your ability to think clearly, react quickly, and form memories. This may cause you to make bad decisions and take more risks. People with sleep deprivation are more likely to get into accidents. Sleep deprivation can also affect your mood, leading to: Irritability Problems with relationships, especially for children and teenagers Depression Anxiety It can also affect your physical health. Research shows that not getting enough sleep, or getting poor-quality sleep, increases your risk of: High blood pressure Heart disease Stroke Kidney disease Obesity Type 2 diabetes Not getting enough sleep can also mean that you don't get enough of the hormones that help children grow and help adults and children build muscle mass, fight infections, and repair cells. Sleep deprivation magnifies the effect of alcohol. A tired person who drinks too much alcohol will be more impaired than a well-rested person. How can I get better sleep? You can take steps to improve your sleep habits. First, make sure that you allow yourself enough time to sleep. With enough sleep each night, you may find that you're happier and more productive during the day. To improve your sleep habits, it also may help to: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day Avoid caffeine , especially in the afternoon and evening Avoid nicotine Exercise regularly, but don't exercise too late in the day Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed Avoid large meals and beverages late at night Don't take a nap after 3 p.m. Relax before bed, for example by taking a bath, reading or listening to relaxing music Keep the temperature in your bedroom cool Get rid of distractions such as noises, bright lights, and a TV or computer in the bedroom. Also, don't be tempted to go on your phone or tablet just before bed. Get enough sunlight exposure during the day Don't lie in bed awake; if you can't sleep for 20 minutes, get up and do something relaxing See a doctor if you have continued trouble sleeping. You may have a sleep disorder , such as insomnia or sleep apnea .  In some cases, your doctor may suggest trying over-the-counter or prescription sleep aid. In other cases, your doctor may want you to do a sleep study, to help diagnose the problem. If you are a shift worker, it can be even harder to get a good sleep. You may also want to: Take naps and increase the amount of time available for sleep Keep the lights bright at work Limit shift changes so your body clock can adjust Limit caffeine use to the first part of your shift Remove sound and light distractions in your bedroom during daytime sleep (for example, use light-blocking curtains)",MedlinePlus
Hearing Aids,https://medlineplus.gov/hearingaids.html,"A hearing aid is a small electronic device that you wear in or behind your ear.  It makes some sounds louder. A hearing aid can help people hear more in both quiet and noisy situations. Hearing aids help people who have hearing loss from damage to the small sensory cells in the inner ear. The damage can occur as a result of disease, aging, or injury from noise or certain medicines. There are different types of hearing aids. They differ by size, their placement on or inside the ear, and how much they amplify sound. The hearing aid that will work best for you depends on what kind of hearing loss you have and how severe it is. If you think that you need a hearing aid, you have two different options: Over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids, which you can buy directly. You don't have to get a hearing exam from a healthcare professional first. OTC hearing aids are for adults who have mild to moderate hearing loss. Prescription hearing aids, which you get from an audiologist (a health professional who specializes in hearing and balance disorders). The audiologist will program the hearing aids, based on how severe your hearing loss is. You may need prescription hearing aids or other devices if you have significant or complicated hearing loss.

Hearing Disorders and Deafness,https://medlineplus.gov/hearingdisordersanddeafness.html,"It's frustrating to be unable to hear well enough to enjoy talking with friends or family. Hearing disorders make it hard, but not impossible, to hear. They can often be helped. Deafness can keep you from hearing sound at all. What causes hearing loss? Some possibilities are: Heredity Diseases such as ear infections and meningitis Trauma Certain medicines Long-term exposure to loud noise Aging There are two main types of hearing loss. One happens when your inner ear or auditory nerve is damaged. This type is usually permanent. The other kind happens when sound waves cannot reach your inner ear. Earwax buildup, fluid, or a punctured eardrum can cause it. Treatment or surgery can often reverse this kind of hearing loss. Untreated, hearing problems can get worse. If you have trouble hearing, you can get help. Possible treatments include hearing aids , cochlear implants , special training, certain medicines, and surgery.

Hearing Problems in Children,https://medlineplus.gov/hearingproblemsinchildren.html,"Most children hear and listen from the moment they are born. They learn to talk by imitating the sounds around them and the voices of their parents and caregivers. But about 2 or 3 out of every 1,000 children in the United States are born deaf or hard-of-hearing. More lose their hearing later during childhood. Babies should have a hearing screening before they are a month old. If your child has a hearing loss, it is important to consider the use of hearing devices and other communication options by age 6 months. That's because children start learning speech and language long before they talk. Hearing problems can be temporary or permanent. Sometimes, ear infections , injuries or diseases affect hearing.

Heart Attack,https://medlineplus.gov/heartattack.html,"Each year almost 800,000 Americans have a heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart suddenly becomes blocked. Without the blood coming in, the heart can't get oxygen. If not treated quickly, the heart muscle begins to die. But if you do get quick treatment, you may be able to prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle. That's why it's important to know the symptoms of a heart attack and call 911 if you or someone else is having them. You should call, even if you are not sure that it is a heart attack. The most common symptoms in men and women are: Chest discomfort. It is often in center or left side of the chest. It usually lasts more than a few minutes. It may go away and come back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain . It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion. Shortness of breath. Sometimes this is your only symptom. You may get it before or during the chest discomfort. It can happen when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity. Discomfort in the upper body. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach. You may also have other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and lightheadedness. You may break out in a cold sweat. Sometimes women will have different symptoms then men. For example, they are more likely to feel tired for no reason. The most common cause of heart attacks is coronary artery disease (CAD). With CAD, there is a buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls or the arteries. This is atherosclerosis . It can build up for years. Eventually an area of plaque can rupture (break open). A blood clot can form around the plaque and block the artery. A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. At the hospital, health care providers make a diagnosis based on your symptoms, blood tests, and different heart health tests . Treatments may include medicines and medical procedures such as coronary angioplasty . After a heart attack, cardiac rehabilitation and lifestyle changes can help you recover.

Heart Disease in Women,https://medlineplus.gov/heartdiseaseinwomen.html,"What is heart disease? Heart disease is a general term that includes many types of heart problems. It's also called cardiovascular disease, which means heart and blood vessel disease. Coronary artery disease (also called coronary heart disease) is the most common type of heart disease in both men and women. It happens slowly over time when a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood. The plaque narrows or blocks blood flow to the heart muscle and can lead to: Angina - chest pain from lack of blood flow Heart attacks - when part of the heart muscle dies from loss of blood flow Heart failure - when your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs Arrhythmia - a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat How does heart disease affect women? In the United States, heart disease is the number one cause of death in women. But women are often not diagnosed with heart disease as quickly as men are. That's because: Women are more likely than men to have ""silent"" heart disease, meaning that they don't have symptoms. Health care providers may not recognize heart disease in women because women's symptoms may be different from men's symptoms. Women are more likely than men to have certain types of heart disease that can be harder to diagnose. A delay in diagnosis may mean a delay in medical care that could help prevent serious problems, such as a heart attack. That's why it's important to learn about your risk for heart disease, the symptoms in women, and how to keep your heart healthy. What types of heart disease do women get? Women can get any type of heart disease. Like men, the most common type of heart disease among women is coronary artery disease. But there are certain types of heart disease which are less common, but affect women more often than men: Coronary microvascular disease - Chest pain from spasms (sudden tightening) in the smallest arteries of the heart that pinch off blood flow. It typically happens during rest or routine activities. This serious condition increases your risk of having a heart attack or other heart diseases.  This type may be harder to diagnose since blockages in smaller arteries can be harder to see on imaging tests. Broken heart syndrome - Strong chest pain or other signs that look like a heart attack. It's caused by the stress of powerful emotions, such as deep grief, anger, or surprise. It can happen even if you're healthy. It mostly affects women after menopause and usually doesn't cause any lasting damage. Variant angina - A rare type of strong chest pain from spasms in the heart arteries. The pain usually happens in a pattern during sleep. Variant angina rarely causes a heart attack. Which women are more likely to develop heart disease? Your risk for developing heart disease increases with: Menopause . Women can develop heart disease at any age, but your risk increases after your periods stop, usually by age 55. Before menopause, your body makes more estrogen (a female hormone ) which helps protect against heart disease. That's why women generally develop coronary artery disease 10 years later than men. During and after menopause, estrogen levels drop and your risk for heart diseases goes up. If your periods stop before age 40, your risk will be higher than other women your age. Family history of heart disease. Your risk for heart disease may be higher if your: Mother or sister had heart disease before age 65. Father or brother had heart disease before age 55. Problems during pregnancy , such as high blood pressure , gestational diabetes , anemia , and high blood pressure . Use of hormonal birth control (pills, patches, or vaginal rings with estrogen and progesterone). Endometriosis . Polycystic ovary syndrome . Inflammatory and autoimmune diseases . Metabolic syndrome . Mental health issues , such as stress, anxiety , or depression . Health risks from a lack physical activity . Obesity or being overweight. Diabetes . Low HDL cholesterol levels . Mild to moderate high blood pressure . Smoking . If you have one or more risks for heart disease, ask your health care provider for help understanding your risk level. Ask if you need any heart tests to help catch heart disease early. What are the symptoms of heart disease and heart attack in women? When women have symptoms of heart disease , they may include: Pain or discomfort in the chest that may be dull and heavy or sharp Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly, or back Nausea or vomiting Unusual fatigue Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air) during physical activity Women who have coronary artery disease are more likely than men to have chest pain when resting or doing daily activities, rather than during exercise. They're also more likely than men to feel chest pain from mental stress. Symptoms of a heart attack in women may also be different than in men. Chest pain is the most common symptom for both sexes. It may feel like crushing or squeezing. But women are somewhat less likely than men to have chest pain. During a heart attack , women may feel: Pressure or tightness in the chest Pain in the upper back, arms, neck, jaw or throat Dizziness Unusual fatigue Indigestion , heartburn , nausea, or vomiting Stomach pain Shortness of breath Heart attacks usually don't look like the sudden, dramatic events we see in the movies. The symptoms may be mild or strong. They may start slowly. They can stop and then come back. Can heart disease in women be prevented? You can help lower your risk by: Learning how to prevent heart disease and making heart-healthy habits part of your daily life. Asking your provider about your personal risk for heart disease and the best way to manage your heart health. Remember, women can have heart disease without symptoms. But if you pay attention to your risk for heart disease, you can take action to prevent problems or keep them from getting worse. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus

What causes heart diseases? The causes of heart disease depend on the type of disease. Some possible causes include lifestyle, genetics, infections, medicines, and other diseases. Who is more likely to develop heart diseases? There are many different factors that can make you more likely to develop heart disease. Some of these factors you can change, but others you cannot. Age. Your risk of heart disease goes up as you get older. Sex. Some factors may affect heart disease risk differently in women than in men. Family history and genetics. A family history of early heart disease raises your risk. And research has shown that some genes are linked to a higher risk of certain heart diseases. Race/ethnicity. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in most racial and ethnic groups in the United States. However, certain groups have higher risks than others. This includes Black people, White people, and American Indian/Alaska Native people. Lifestyle habits. Over time, unhealthy lifestyle habits can raise your risk of heart disease. These can include: Eating a diet high in saturated fats , refined carbohydrates, and salt . Not getting enough physical activity . Drinking too much alcohol . Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke . Too much stress . Having other medical conditions can raise your risk of heart diseases. These conditions include: High blood pressure .

Heart Failure,https://medlineplus.gov/heartfailure.html,"What is heart failure? Heart failure means that your heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your body's needs. Heart failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop beating. But without enough blood flow, your organs may not work well, which can cause serious problems. Heart failure can affect one or both sides of your heart: With right-sided heart failure , your heart is too weak to pump enough blood to your lungs to get oxygen. With left-sided heart failure , your heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood out to your body. This happens when the left side of your heart becomes either: Too weak to pump enough blood. Too thick or stiff to relax and fill with enough blood. Left-sided heart failure is more common than right-sided heart failure. What causes heart failure? Heart failure can start suddenly after a medical condition or injury damages your heart muscle. But in most cases, heart failure develops slowly from long-term medical conditions. Conditions that can cause heart failure include: Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Cardiomyopathy Congenital heart defects or other types of heart diseases that you are born with Coronary artery disease Endocarditis Heart attack Heart valve diseases High blood pressure A blood clot in your lung Diabetes Certain severe lung diseases , such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Obesity Over time, left-sided heart failure can lead to right-sided heart failure. Who is more likely to develop heart failure? Heart failure can happen at any age. It happens to both men and women, but men often develop it at a younger age than women.  Your chance of developing heart failure increases if: You're 65 years old or older. Aging can weaken and stiffen your heart muscle. Your family health history includes relatives who have or have had heart failure. You have changes in your genes that affect your heart tissue. You have habits that can harm your heart , including: Smoking Eating foods high in fat , cholesterol , and sodium (salt) Having an inactive lifestyle Alcohol use disorder (AUD) Illegal drug use You have other medical conditions that can affect your heart , including: Any heart or blood vessel conditions, including high blood pressure Serious lung diseases Infection, such as HIV or COVID-19 Obesity Diabetes Sleep apnea Chronic kidney disease Anemia Thyroid disease Iron overload disease Cancer treatments that can harm your heart, such as radiation and chemotherapy You are African American. African Americans are more likely to develop heart failure and have more serious cases at younger ages than people of other races. Factors such as stigma, discrimination, income, education, and geographic region can also affect their risk of heart failure. What are the symptoms of heart failure? The symptoms of heart failure depend on which side of your heart is affected and how serious your condition has become.  Most symptoms are caused by reduced blood flow to your organs and fluid buildup in your body. Fluid buildup happens because the flow of blood through your heart is too slow. As a result, blood backs up in the vessels that return the blood to your heart. Fluid may leak from the blood vessels and collect in the tissues of your body, causing swelling ( edema ) and other problems. Symptoms of heart failure may include: Feeling short of breath (like you can't get enough air) when you do things like climbing stairs. This may be one of the first symptoms you notice. Fatigue or weakness even after rest. Coughing . Swelling and weight gain from fluid in your ankles, lower legs, or abdomen (belly). Difficulty sleeping when lying flat. Nausea and loss of appetite. Swelling in the veins of your neck. Needing to urinate (pee) often . At first you may have no symptoms or mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms will usually bother you more. What other problems does heart failure cause? Fluid buildup and reduced blood flow to your organs can lead to serious problems, including: Breathing problems from fluid in and around your lungs (also called congestive heart failure) Kidney or liver damage , including cirrhosis Malnutrition if fluid buildup makes eating uncomfortable or if your stomach doesn't get enough blood flow to digest food properly Other heart conditions , such as irregular heartbeat and sudden cardiac arrest Pulmonary hypertension How is heart failure diagnosed? To find out if you have heart failure, your health care provider will Ask about your medical history , including your symptoms Ask about your family health history , including relatives who have had heart failure Do a physical exam Likely run heart tests and blood tests , including a brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) test In some cases, your provider may refer you to a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) for tests, diagnosis, and care. What are the treatments for heart failure? Your treatment will depend on the type of heart failure you have and how serious it is. There's no cure for heart failure. But treatment can help you live longer with fewer symptoms. Even with treatment, heart failure usually gets worse over time, so you'll likely need treatment for the rest of your life. Most treatment plans include: Taking medicine Eating less sodium and drinking less liquid to control fluid buildup Making other changes, such as quitting smoking , managing stress , and getting as much physical activity as your provider recommends Treating any conditions that may make heart failure worse You may need heart surgery if: You have a congenital heart defect or damage to your heart that can be fixed. The left side of your heart is getting weaker and putting a device in your chest could help. Devices include: An implantable cardioverter defibrillator. A biventricular pacemaker (cardiac resynchronization therapy). A mechanical heart pump (a ventricular assist device (VAD) or a total artificial heart). Your heart doctor recommends a heart transplant because your heart failure is life-threatening and nothing else is helping. As part of your treatment, you'll need to pay close attention to your symptoms, because heart failure can worsen suddenly. Your provider may suggest a cardiac rehabilitation program to help you learn how to manage your condition. Can heart failure be prevented? You may be able to prevent or delay heart failure if you: Work with your provider to manage any health conditions that increase your risk of developing heart failure Make healthy changes in your eating, exercise, and other daily habits to help prevent heart disease NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus

Blood tests and heart health tests can help find heart diseases or identify problems that can lead to heart diseases. There are several different types of heart health tests. Your health care provider will decide which test or tests you need, based on your symptoms (if any), risk factors , and medical history. Cardiac Catheterization Cardiac catheterization is a medical procedure used to diagnose and treat some heart conditions. For the procedure, your provider puts a catheter (a long, thin, flexible tube) into a blood vessel in your arm, groin, or neck, and threads it to your heart. The provider can use the catheter to: Do a coronary angiography. This involves putting a special type of dye in the catheter, so the dye can flow through your bloodstream to your heart. Then your provider takes x-rays of your heart. The dye allows your provider to see your coronary arteries on the x-ray, and to check for coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is caused by plaque buildup in the arteries . Take samples of your blood and heart muscle. Examine your heart valves . Do procedures such as angioplasty or minor heart surgeries to repair congenital heart defects or replace heart valves. Cardiac CT Scan A cardiac CT ( computed tomography ) scan is a painless imaging test that uses x-rays to take detailed pictures of your heart and its blood vessels. Computers can combine these pictures to create a three-dimensional (3D) model of your whole heart. This test can help providers detect or evaluate various heart problems, including: Coronary artery disease Calcium buildup in the coronary arteries Congenital heart defects Problems with the aorta (the main artery that carries blood away from the heart) Problems with heart function and valves Pericardial diseases Before you have the test, you get an injection of contrast dye. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the pictures. The CT scanner is a large, tunnel-like machine. You lie still on a table that slides you into the scanner, and the scanner takes the pictures. Cardiac MRI Cardiac MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) is a painless imaging test that uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create detailed pictures of your heart. It can help your provider figure out whether you have heart disease, and if so, how severe it is. A cardiac MRI can also help your provider decide the best way to treat heart problems such as: Congenital heart defects Coronary artery disease Heart valve problems Pericarditis Cardiac tumors Damage from a heart attack The MRI is a large, tunnel-like machine. You lie still on a table that slides you into the MRI machine. The machine makes loud noises as it takes pictures of your heart. Sometimes before the test, you might get an injection of contrast dye. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the pictures. Chest X-Ray A chest x-ray creates pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. It can reveal signs of heart failure , as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to heart disease. Coronary Angiography Coronary angiography (angiogram) is a procedure that uses contrast dye and x-ray pictures to look at the insides of your arteries. It can show whether plaque is blocking your arteries and how severe the blockage is. Providers use this procedure to diagnose heart diseases after chest pain , sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), or abnormal results from other heart tests such as an EKG or a stress test. You usually have a cardiac catheterization to inject the dye into your coronary arteries. Then the provider will take special x-rays while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your provider study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels. Echocardiography Echocardiography, or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create moving pictures of your heart. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart. They also show how well your heart's chambers and valves are working. Providers use an echo to diagnose many different heart problems, and to check how severe they are. There are several different types of echocardiography. For transthoracic echocardiography (the most common type), a technician applies gel to your chest. The gel helps sound waves reach your heart. The technician moves a transducer (wand-like device) across your chest. The transducer connects to a computer. It transmits ultrasound waves into your chest, and the waves bounce (echo) back. The computer converts the echoes into pictures of your heart. Electrocardiogram (EKG), (ECG) An electrocardiogram, also called an ECG or EKG, is a painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. It shows how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is steady or irregular. An EKG may be part of a routine exam to screen for heart disease. Or you may get it to detect and study heart problems such as heart attacks, arrhythmia , and heart failure. For the test, you lie still on a table and a nurse or technician attaches electrodes (patches that have sensors) to the skin on your chest, arms, and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a machine that records your heart's electrical activity. Stress Testing Stress testing looks at how your heart works during physical stress. It can help to diagnose coronary artery disease, and to check how severe it is. It can also check for other problems, including heart valve disease and heart failure. For the test, you exercise (or are given medicine if you are unable to exercise) to make your heart work hard and beat fast. While this is happening, you get an EKG and blood pressure monitoring. Before or after the test, you might also have an echocardiogram, or other imaging tests such as a nuclear scan . For the nuclear scan, you get an injection of a tracer (a radioactive substance), which travels to your heart. Special cameras detect the energy from the tracer to craeate pictures of your heart. You have pictures taken after you exercise, and then after you rest. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Heart Surgery,https://medlineplus.gov/heartsurgery.html,"What is heart surgery? Heart surgery can correct certain heart problems when other treatments haven't worked or can't be used. In some cases, heart surgery may be a medical emergency. For example, surgery for a severe heart attack may need to be done right away. In other cases, you can plan heart surgery ahead of time. Some heart surgeries are major operations, such as heart bypass surgery for blocked arteries in the heart. Other surgeries are more minor heart procedures, such as putting in a pacemaker. What conditions does heart surgery treat? There are different types of heart surgery that can help treat many heart conditions: What conditions does heart surgery treat? What does the heart surgery do? Coronary artery disease (CAD) - when a sticky substance called plaque narrows or blocks the arteries that supply blood to your heart muscle. Makes a new path for blood to flow around the blocked part of an artery in the heart. This is called a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) , or heart bypass. It's the most common heart surgery in adults. Heart valve diseases - problems with the valves that control the flow of blood through your heart. Repairs heart valves. Replaces heart valves with a mechanical valve or a biologic valve made from pig, cow, or human heart tissue. Arrhythmia - problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. They are caused by changes in the electrical signals that control your heartbeat. Places a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in the chest to correct your heartbeat. Treats atrial fibrillation with small cuts in the heart muscle. The cuts form scars that make a path for the heart's electrical signals (Maze surgery). Heart failure - when your heart is too weak or stiff to pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your body's needs. Places a device in the chest which may include: An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to help prevent sudden cardiac arrest . A biventricular pacemaker to coordinate the heart's pumping action so it's more powerful. A ventricular assist device to help the heart pump blood. A total artificial heart to pump blood for the heart. Replaces a seriously diseased heart with a heathy heart ( heart transplantation ). Heart aneurysm - a balloon-like bulge in the wall of an artery. It can be life-threatening if the aneurysm tears or bursts. Repairs or replaces the weak part of a heart artery using a patch or a tube made of fabric. Angina - chest pain from coronary artery disease. Uses a laser to make small channels through part of the heart muscle (transmyocardial laser revascularization). Damaged and abnormal heart structures, including congenital heart defects - heart structure problems that you're born with. Repairs heart damage or problems with how the heart and blood vessels are formed. Repairs depend on the type of defect or damage. What approaches do surgeons use to do heart surgery? The approach a surgeon uses to do heart surgery depends on your heart problem, your general health, and other factors. Approaches to heart surgery include: Open-heart surgery (also called traditional heart surgery) is when the surgeon cuts the chest open to reach the heart. Because it's difficult to operate on a beating heart, medicines are used to stop the heart. A heart-lung bypass machine keeps oxygen-rich blood pumping through the body during the surgery. Off-pump heart surgery is open-heart surgery on a beating heart without using a heart-lung bypass machine. The surgeon holds the heart steady with a device. Surgeons may use off-pump heart surgery to do coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), but only in certain cases. Minimally invasive heart surgery uses small cuts between the ribs. The cuts may be as small as 2 to 3 inches. The surgeon inserts tools into the chest through the cuts. This type of heart surgery may or may not use a heart-lung bypass machine. Robotic-assisted surgery is a type of minimally invasive surgery. The surgeon uses a computer to control tools on the arms of a robot. This allows the surgeon to be very accurate when doing difficult operations. What are the risks of heart surgery? Like all surgery, heart surgery has risks even though the results are often excellent. The risks include: Bleeding Infection, fever , and swelling A problem from anesthesia (medicine that makes you sleep during surgery) Arrhythmia Damage to the heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs Stroke The risks of heart surgery tend to be higher if: The surgery is an emergency. You have other medical conditions, including: Diabetes Kidney diseases Lung diseases Peripheral artery disease (PAD) NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Heart Transplantation,https://medlineplus.gov/hearttransplantation.html,"A heart transplant removes a damaged or diseased heart and replaces it with a healthy one. The healthy heart comes from a donor who has died. It is the last resort for people with heart failure when all other treatments have failed. The heart failure might have been caused by coronary heart disease, damaged heart valves or heart muscles, congenital heart defects, or viral infections of the heart. Although heart transplant surgery is a life-saving measure, it has many risks. Careful monitoring, treatment, and regular medical care can prevent or help manage some of these risks. After the surgery, most heart transplant patients can return to their normal levels of activity. However, fewer than 30% return to work for many different reasons. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Heart Valve Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/heartvalvediseases.html,"What are heart valve diseases? Heart valve disease happens when one or more of your heart valves don't work well. Your heart has four valves: the tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic valves. The valves have flaps that open and close. The flaps make sure that blood flows in the right direction through your heart and to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats they close to stop the blood from flowing backwards. If one or more of your heart valves doesn't open or close correctly, it can affect your blood flow and strain your heart. Fortunately, treatment helps most valve diseases. What are the types of heart valve diseases? Heart valves can have three basic kinds of problems: Regurgitation , or backflow, happens when the flaps of a valve don't close tightly. This allows the blood to leak backwards. A common cause of regurgitation is prolapse, where the flaps of the valve flop or bulge back. Prolapse most often affects the mitral valve . Stenosis happens when the flaps of a valve become thick, stiff, or stuck together. This prevents the heart valve from opening all the way. Not enough blood can pass through the valve. Aortic valve stenosis is a common type of stenosis. It affects the valve that controls blood flow into the large artery that carries blood out of the heart to the body. Atresia happens when a heart valve did not form properly and does not have an opening for blood to pass through. Sometimes a valve can have both regurgitation and stenosis. What causes heart valve diseases? Some people are born with heart valve disease. This is called congenital heart valve disease. It can happen alone or along with other congenital heart defects . Heart valve disease can also develop over time as you get older or have certain conditions that affect the heart. Who is more likely to develop heart valve diseases? Your chance of having heart valve disease is higher if: You are older. With age, the heart valves can become thick and stiff. You have or have had other conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels. These include: Rheumatic fever. An untreated strep throat can become rheumatic fever, which can harm the heart valves. The damage may not show up for years. Today, most people take antibiotics to cure strep throat before it can cause heart valve damage. Endocarditis . This is a rare infection in the lining of the heart and heart valves. It is usually caused by bacteria in the bloodstream. A heart attack. Heart failure . Coronary artery disease , especially when it affects the aorta (the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the body). High blood pressure. High blood cholesterol . Diabetes . Obesity and overweight. Lack of physical activity . A family history of early heart disease: A father or brother who had heart disease younger than 55. A mother or sister who had heart disease younger than 65. You were born with an aortic valve that wasn't formed right. Sometimes this will cause problems right away. Other times, the valve may work well enough for years before causing problems. What are the symptoms of heart valve diseases? Many people live their whole lives with a heart valve that doesn't work perfectly and never have any problems. But heart valve disease may get worse slowly over time. You may develop signs and symptoms, such as: Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air) Fatigue Swelling in your feet, ankles, abdomen (belly), or the veins in your neck Chest pain when you're physically active Arrhythmia , a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat Dizziness or fainting If you don't get treatment for heart valve disease, the symptoms and strain on your heart may keep getting worse. What other problems can heart valve diseases cause? When the valves don't work well, your heart has to pump harder to get enough blood out to the body.  Without treatment, this extra workload on your heart can lead to: Heart failure Stroke Blood clots Sudden cardiac arrest or death How is heart valve disease diagnosed? Your health care provider may listen to your heart with a stethoscope and hear that your heart makes abnormal sounds, such as a click or a heart murmur. These sounds may mean a valve isn't working normally. The provider will usually refer you to a cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in heart diseases. The doctor will also listen to your heart and will do a physical exam. You will also likely need to have one or more heart tests . What are the treatments for heart valve diseases? Most heart valve problems can be treated successfully. Treatment may include: Medicines to control your symptoms and keep your heart pumping well Heart-healthy lifestyle changes to treat other related heart conditions Surgery to repair or replace a valve It's possible that you may need surgery, even if you don't have symptoms. Fixing the valve can help prevent future heart problems. There are many ways to do heart valve surgery. You and your doctor can decide what's best for you, based on your valve problem and general health. Heart valve repair surgery has fewer risks than heart valve replacement. So, when repair is possible, it's preferred over valve replacement. In some cases, valve replacement is necessary. There are 2 types of replacement valves: Biologic valves made from pig, cow, or human tissue. These valves tend to wear out after 10 to 15 years, but some may last longer. Mechanical (human-made) valves usually don't wear out. But with a mechanical valve, you usually have to take blood thinners for the rest of your life to prevent blood clots. And your risk of endocarditis (a heart infection) is higher than with a biologic valve. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Heartburn,https://medlineplus.gov/heartburn.html,"Heartburn is a painful burning feeling in your chest or throat. It happens when stomach acid backs up into your esophagus, the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. If you have heartburn more than twice a week, you may have GERD . But you can have GERD without having heartburn. Pregnancy, certain foods, alcohol, and some medications can bring on heartburn. Treating heartburn is important because over time reflux can damage the esophagus. Over-the-counter medicines may help.  If the heartburn continues, you may need prescription medicines or surgery. If you have other symptoms such as crushing chest pain, it could be a heart attack . Get help immediately.",MedlinePlus
Heat Illness,https://medlineplus.gov/heatillness.html,"Your body normally cools itself by sweating.  During hot weather, especially when it is very humid, sweating just isn't enough to cool you off. Your body temperature can rise to dangerous levels and you can develop a heat illness. Most heat illnesses happen when you stay out in the heat too long. Exercising and working outside in high heat can also lead to heat illness. Older adults, young children, and those who are sick or overweight are most at risk. Taking certain medicines or drinking alcohol can also raise your risk. Heat-related illnesses include: Heat stroke - a life-threatening illness in which body temperature may rise above 106 °F (41 °C) in minutes. Symptoms include dry skin, a rapid, strong pulse, dizziness, nausea, and confusion. If you see any of these signs, get medical help right away. Heat exhaustion -  an illness that can happen after several days of exposure to high temperatures and not enough fluids. Symptoms include heavy sweating, rapid breathing, and a fast, weak pulse. If it is not treated, it can turn into heat stroke. Heat cramps - muscle pains or spasms that happen during heavy exercise. You usually get them in your abdomen, arms, or legs. Heat rash - skin irritation from excessive sweating. It is more common in young children. You can lower your risk of heat illness by drinking fluids to prevent dehydration , replacing lost salt and minerals, and limiting your time in the heat.

Helicobacter Pylori Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/helicobacterpyloriinfections.html,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a type of bacteria that causes infection in the stomach. It is the main cause of peptic ulcers , and it can also cause gastritis and stomach cancer . About 30 to 40% of people in the United States get an H. pylori infection. Most people get it as a child. H. pylori usually does not cause symptoms. But it can break down the inner protective coating in some people's stomachs and cause inflammation. This can lead to gastritis or a peptic ulcer. Researchers aren't sure how H. pylori spreads. They think that it may spread by unclean food and water, or through contact with an infected person's saliva and other body fluids. A peptic ulcer causes a dull or burning pain in your stomach, especially when you have an empty stomach. It lasts for minutes to hours, and it may come and go for several days or weeks.  It may also cause other symptoms, such as bloating, nausea, and weight loss. If you have the symptoms of a peptic ulcer, your health care provider will check to see whether you have H. pylori.  There are blood, breath, and stool tests to check for H. pylori. In some cases, you may need an upper endoscopy , often with a biopsy . If you do have a peptic ulcer, the treatment is with a combination of antibiotics and acid-reducing medicines. You will need to be tested again after treatment to make sure the infection is gone. There is no vaccine for H. pylori.

Hemochromatosis,https://medlineplus.gov/hemochromatosis.html,"Hemochromatosis is a disease in which too much iron builds up in your body. Your body needs iron but too much of it is toxic. If you have hemochromatosis, you absorb more iron than you need. Your body has no natural way to get rid of the extra iron. It stores it in body tissues, especially the liver, heart, and pancreas. The extra iron can damage your organs. Without treatment, it can cause your organs to fail. There are two types of hemochromatosis. Primary hemochromatosis is an inherited disease. Secondary hemochromatosis is usually the result of something else, such as anemia, thalassemia, liver disease, or blood transfusions. Many symptoms of hemochromatosis are similar to those of other diseases. Not everyone has symptoms. If you do, you may have joint pain, fatigue, general weakness, weight loss, and stomach pain. Your doctor will diagnose hemochromatosis based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures. Treatments include removing blood (and iron) from your body, medicines, and changes in your diet. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Hemophilia,https://medlineplus.gov/hemophilia.html,"What is hemophilia? Hemophilia is a rare bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly. This can lead to problems with bleeding too much after an injury or surgery. You can also have sudden bleeding inside your body, such as in your joints, muscles, and organs. Your blood contains many proteins called clotting factors that can help form clots to stop bleeding. People with hemophilia have low levels of one of these factors, usually either factor VIII (8) or factor IX (9). How severe the hemophilia is depends on the amount of factor in the blood. The lower the amount of the factor, the more likely it is that bleeding could happen and might lead to serious health problems. What are the types of hemophilia? There are several different types of hemophilia. The most common are: Hemophilia A (classic hemophilia), which is caused by a lack or decrease of clotting factor VIII (8) Hemophilia B (Christmas disease), which is caused by a lack or decrease of clotting factor IX (9) What causes hemophilia? Most types of hemophilia are inherited. They are caused by change in one of the genes (also called a mutation) that provides instructions for making the clotting factor proteins. The change may mean that the clotting proteins don't work properly or that they are missing altogether. These genes are on the X chromosome. You may have one or two X chromosomes: People who are born male have one X chromosome (from the mother) and one Y chromosome (from the father). They can get hemophilia if their one X chromosome has the gene change. People who are born female have two X chromosomes, one from the father and one from the mother. They usually only get hemophilia if: Both X chromosomes have the gene change OR One X chromosome has the gene change and the other X chromosome is missing or inactive. People who are born female who have the gene change on one X chromosome are a ""carrier"" of hemophilia. Sometimes they may have some symptoms of hemophilia. They can pass the gene change on to their children. Hemophilia that is not inherited is called acquired hemophilia. It is rare. It happens when your body makes specialized proteins called autoantibodies that attack and disable a clotting factor. This can happen because of pregnancy, immune system disorders , cancer, or allergic reactions to certain medicines. Sometimes the cause is unknown. Who is at risk for hemophilia? Hemophilia is much more common in people who were born male since they can get it with a change to the gene on one X chromosome. People who have a family history of hemophilia are also at higher risk. What are the symptoms of hemophilia? The signs and symptoms of hemophilia are: Bleeding into the joints. This can cause swelling and pain or tightness in the joints. It often affects the knees, elbows, and ankles. Bleeding into the skin (which is bruising ). Bleeding into the muscle and soft tissue, which can cause a build-up of blood in the area (called a hematoma). Bleeding of the mouth and gums, including bleeding that is hard to stop after you lose a tooth. Bleeding after circumcision . Bleeding after having shots, such as vaccinations . Bleeding in the head of an infant after a difficult delivery. Blood in the urine or stool. Frequent and hard-to-stop nosebleeds. In some cases, severe hemophilia may cause bleeding in the brain. This may cause brain damage and can be life-threatening. How is hemophilia diagnosed? To find out if you have hemophilia, your health care provider will: Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms and other health conditions you may have. Ask about your family history, to find out if you have relatives who have or had hemophilia. Do a physical exam to look for signs of hemophilia, such as bruising. Do certain blood tests to show if your blood is clotting properly. If it does not, then you will have clotting factor tests to diagnose the cause of the bleeding disorder. These blood tests would show the type of hemophilia and the severity. There is genetic testing for the factor VIII (8) and factor IX (9) genes. This testing may be used in people who have a family history of hemophilia to: Identify people who are carriers before they make decisions about pregnancy Test a fetus for hemophilia during pregnancy Test a newborn for hemophilia What are the treatments for hemophilia? The best way to treat hemophilia is to replace the missing clotting factor so that your blood can clot properly. This is usually done by injecting replacement clotting factor into a vein. The replacement clotting factor may be made from donated human blood. Or it may be made in a lab; this kind is called a recombinant clotting factor. Replacement clotting factor can help treat a bleeding episode. In more severe cases of hemophilia, you might get the factor on a regular basis to prevent bleeding. You can learn how to inject the factor so that you can do it yourself at home. There are other medicines to treat hemophilia. They may work by releasing factor VIII (8) from where it is stored in the body tissues, replacing the function of factor VIII (8), or preventing clots from breaking down. If bleeding has damaged your joints, physical therapy may help them function better. Good quality medical care from healthcare professionals who know a lot about the disorder can help prevent some serious problems. Often the best choice for care is to visit a hemophilia treatment center (HTC) . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus
Hemorrhagic Fevers,https://medlineplus.gov/hemorrhagicfevers.html,"Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a group of illnesses caused by four families of viruses. These include the Ebola and Marburg, Lassa fever, and yellow fever viruses. VHFs have common features: they affect many organs, they damage the blood vessels, and they affect the body's ability to regulate itself. Some VHFs cause mild disease, but some, like Ebola or Marburg, cause severe disease and death. VHFs are found around the world. Specific diseases are usually limited to areas where the animals that carry them live. For example, Lassa fever is limited to rural areas of West Africa where rats and mice carry the virus. The risk for travelers is low, but you should avoid visiting areas where there are disease outbreaks.

Hemorrhoids,https://medlineplus.gov/hemorrhoids.html,"What are hemorrhoids? Hemorrhoids are swollen, inflamed veins around your anus or the lower part of your rectum . There are two types: External hemorrhoids, which form under the skin around your anus Internal hemorrhoids, which form in the lining of your anus and lower rectum What causes hemorrhoids? Hemorrhoids happen when there is too much pressure on the veins around the anus. This can be caused by: Straining during bowel movements . Sitting on the toilet for long periods of time. Chronic constipation or diarrhea . A low- fiber diet. Weakening of the supporting tissues in your anus and rectum. This can happen with aging and pregnancy . Frequently lifting heavy objects. What are the symptoms of hemorrhoids? The symptoms of hemorrhoids depend on which type you have: With external hemorrhoids, you may have: Anal itching One or more hard, tender lumps near your anus Anal pain, especially when sitting Too much straining, rubbing, or cleaning around your anus may make your symptoms worse. For many people, the symptoms of external hemorrhoids go away within a few days. With internal hemorrhoids, you may have: Bleeding from your rectum - you would see bright red blood in your stool, on toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl after a bowel movement Prolapse, which is a hemorrhoid that has fallen through your anal opening Internal hemorrhoids are usually not painful unless they are prolapsed. Prolapsed internal hemorrhoids may cause pain and discomfort. How can I treat hemorrhoids at home? You can most often treat your hemorrhoids at home by: Eating foods that are high in fiber. Taking a stool softener or a fiber supplement. Drinking enough fluids every day. Not straining during bowel movements. Not sitting on the toilet for long periods of time. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers . Taking warm baths several times a day to help relieve pain. This could be a regular bath or a sitz bath. With a sitz bath, you use a special plastic tub that allows you to sit in a few inches of warm water. Using over-the-counter hemorrhoid creams, ointments, or suppositories to relieve mild pain, swelling, and itching of external hemorrhoids. When do I need to see a health care provider for hemorrhoids? You should see your health care provider if you: Still have symptoms after 1 week of at-home treatment. Have bleeding from your rectum. Hemorrhoids are a common cause of bleeding, but other conditions can also cause bleeding. They include Crohn's disease , ulcerative colitis , colorectal cancer , and anal cancer . So it's important to see your provider to find the cause of the bleeding. How are hemorrhoids diagnosed? To find out if you have hemorrhoids, your health care provider: Will ask about your medical history. Will do a physical exam. Often providers can diagnose external hemorrhoids by looking at the area around your anus. Will do a digital rectal exam to check for internal hemorrhoids. For this, the provider will insert a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for anything that is abnormal. May do procedures such as an anoscopy to check for internal hemorrhoids. What are the treatments for hemorrhoids? If at-home treatments for hemorrhoids don't help you, you may need a medical procedure. There are several different procedures that your provider can do in the office. These procedures use different techniques to cause scar tissue to form in the hemorrhoids. This cuts off the blood supply, which usually shrinks the hemorrhoids. In severe cases, you may need surgery. Can hemorrhoids be prevented? You can help prevent hemorrhoids by: Eating foods that are high in fiber Taking a stool softener or a fiber supplement Drinking enough fluids every day Not straining during bowel movements Not sitting on the toilet for long periods of time NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",MedlinePlus
Hepatitis,https://medlineplus.gov/hepatitis.html,"What is hepatitis? Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver . Inflammation is swelling that happens when tissues of the body are injured or infected. It can damage your liver. This swelling and damage can affect how well your liver functions. Hepatitis can be an acute (short-term) infection or a chronic (long-term) infection. Some types of hepatitis cause only acute infections. Other types can cause both acute and chronic infections. What causes hepatitis? There are different types of hepatitis, with different causes: Viral hepatitis is the most common type. It is caused by one of several viruses -- hepatitis viruses A , B , C , D, and E. In the United States, A, B, and C are the most common. Alcoholic hepatitis is caused by heavy alcohol use Toxic hepatitis can be caused by certain poisons, chemicals, medicines, or supplements Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic type in which your body's immune system attacks your liver. The cause is not known, but genetics and your environment may play a role. How is viral hepatitis spread? Hepatitis A and hepatitis E usually spread through contact with food or water that was contaminated with an infected person's stool. You can also get hepatitis E by eating undercooked pork, deer, or shellfish. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis D spread through contact with the blood of someone who has the disease. Hepatitis B and D may also spread through contact with other body fluids. This can happen in many ways, such as sharing drug needles or having unprotected sex. Who is at risk for hepatitis? The risks are different for the different types of hepatitis. For example, with most of the viral types, your risk is higher if you have unprotected sex.  People who drink a lot over long periods of time are at risk for alcoholic hepatitis. What are the symptoms of hepatitis? Some people with hepatitis do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected. If you do have symptoms, they may include: Fever Fatigue Loss of appetite Nausea and/or vomiting Abdominal pain Dark urine Clay-colored bowel movements Joint pain Jaundice , yellowing of your skin and eyes If you have an acute infection, your symptoms can start anywhere between 2 weeks to 6 months after you got infected. If you have a chronic infection, you may not have symptoms until many years later. What other problems can hepatitis cause? Chronic hepatitis can lead to complications such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver failure, and liver cancer . Early diagnosis and treatment of chronic hepatitis may prevent these complications. How is hepatitis diagnosed? To diagnose hepatitis, your health care provider: Will ask about your symptoms and medical history Will do a physical exam Will likely do blood tests, including tests for viral hepatitis Might do imaging tests , such as an ultrasound , CT scan , or MRI May need to do a liver biopsy to get a clear diagnosis and check for liver damage What are the treatments for hepatitis? Treatment for hepatitis depends on which type you have and whether it is acute or chronic. Acute viral hepatitis often goes away on its own. To feel better, you may just need to rest and get enough fluids. But in some cases, it may be more serious. You might even need treatment in a hospital. There are different medicines to treat the different chronic types of hepatitis. Possible other treatments may include surgery and other medical procedures. People who have alcoholic hepatitis need to stop drinking. If your chronic hepatitis leads to liver failure or liver cancer, you may need a liver transplant . Can hepatitis be prevented? There are different ways to prevent or lower your risk for hepatitis, depending on the type of hepatitis. For example, not drinking too much alcohol can prevent alcoholic hepatitis. There are vaccines to prevent hepatitis A and B. Autoimmune hepatitis cannot be prevented. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",MedlinePlus
Hepatitis A,https://medlineplus.gov/hepatitisa.html,"What is hepatitis? Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver . Inflammation is swelling that happens when tissues of the body are injured or infected. It can damage your liver. This swelling and damage can affect how well your liver functions. What is hepatitis A? Hepatitis A is a type of viral hepatitis. It causes an acute, or short-term, infection. This means that people usually get better without treatment after a few weeks. Thanks to a vaccine, hepatitis A is not very common in the United States. What causes hepatitis A? Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus spreads through contact with an infected person's stool. This can happen if you: Eat food made by someone who has the virus and did not properly wash their hands after using the bathroom Drink contaminated water or eat foods that were rinsed with contaminated water Have close personal contact with someone who has hepatitis A. This could be through certain types of sex (like oral-anal sex), taking care of someone who is ill, or using illegal drugs with others. Who is at risk for hepatitis A? Although anyone can get hepatitis A, you are at higher risk if you: Travel to developing countries Have sex with someone who has hepatitis A Are a man who has sex with men Use illegal drugs Are experiencing homelessness Live with or care for someone who has hepatitis A Live with or care for a child recently adopted from a country where hepatitis A is common What are the symptoms of hepatitis A? Not everyone with hepatitis A has symptoms. Adults are more likely to have symptoms than children. If you do have symptoms, they usually start 2 to 7 weeks after infection. They can include: Dark yellow urine Diarrhea Fatigue Fever Gray- or clay-colored stools Joint pain Loss of appetite Nausea and/or vomiting Abdominal pain Yellowish eyes and skin, called jaundice The symptoms usually last less than 2 months, although some people can be ill for as long as 6 months. You are at a higher risk of getting a more severe infection from hepatitis A if you also have HIV , hepatitis B , or hepatitis C . What other problems can hepatitis A cause? In rare cases, hepatitis A may lead to liver failure. This is more common in adults over age 50 and in people who have another liver disease . How is hepatitis A diagnosed? To diagnose hepatitis A, your health care provider may use many tools: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A physical exam Blood tests, including tests for viral hepatitis What are the treatments for hepatitis A? There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. The best way to recover is to rest, drink plenty of liquids, and eat healthy foods. Your provider may also suggest medicines to help relieve symptoms. In more severe cases, you may need care in a hospital. Can hepatitis A be prevented? The best way to prevent hepatitis A is to get the hepatitis A vaccine. It is also important to have good hygiene , especially washing your hands thoroughly after you go to the bathroom. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",MedlinePlus
Hepatitis B,https://medlineplus.gov/hepatitisb.html,"What is hepatitis? Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver . Inflammation is swelling that happens when tissues of the body are injured or infected. It can damage your liver. This swelling and damage can affect how well your liver functions. What is hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is a type of viral hepatitis. It can cause an acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) infection. People with an acute infection usually get better on their own without treatment. Some people with chronic hepatitis B will need treatment. Thanks to a vaccine, hepatitis B is not very common in the United States. It is more common in certain parts of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. What causes hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus. The virus spreads through contact with blood, semen, or other body fluids from a person who has the virus. Who is at risk for hepatitis B? Anyone can get hepatitis B, but the risk is higher in: Infants born to mothers who have hepatitis B People who inject drugs or share needles, syringes, and other types of drug equipment Sex partners of people with hepatitis B, especially if they are not using latex or polyurethane condoms during sex Men who have sex with men People who live with someone who has hepatitis B, especially if they use the same razor, toothbrush, or nail clippers Health care and public-safety workers who are exposed to blood on the job Hemodialysis patients People who have lived in or traveled often to parts of the world where hepatitis B is common People who have diabetes , hepatitis C , or HIV What are the symptoms of hepatitis B? Often, people with hepatitis B don't have symptoms. Adults and children over 5 are more likely to have symptoms than younger children. Some people with acute hepatitis B have symptoms 2 to 5 months after infection. These symptoms can include: Dark yellow urine Diarrhea Fatigue Fever Gray- or clay-colored stools Joint pain Loss of appetite Nausea and/or vomiting Abdominal pain Yellowish eyes and skin, called jaundice If you have chronic hepatitis B, you may not have symptoms until complications develop. This could be decades after you were infected. For this reason, hepatitis B screening is important, even if you have no symptoms. Screening means that you are tested for a disease even though you don't have symptoms. If you are at high risk, your health care provider may suggest  screening. What other problems can hepatitis B cause? In rare cases, acute hepatitis B can cause liver failure. Chronic hepatitis B can develop into a serious disease that causes long-term health problems such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver cancer , and liver failure. If you have ever had hepatitis B, the virus may become active again, or reactivated, later in life. This could start to damage the liver and cause symptoms. How is hepatitis B diagnosed? To diagnose hepatitis B, your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A physical exam Blood tests, including tests for viral hepatitis What are the treatments for hepatitis B? If you have acute hepatitis B, you probably don't need treatment. Some people with chronic hepatitis B don't need treatment. But if you have a chronic infection and blood tests show that hepatitis B could be damaging your liver, you may need to take antiviral medicines. Can hepatitis B be prevented? The best way to prevent hepatitis B is to get the hepatitis B vaccine. You can also reduce your chance of hepatitis B infection by: Not sharing drug needles or other drug materials Wearing gloves if you have to touch another person's blood or open sores Making sure your tattoo artist or body piercer uses sterile tools Not sharing personal items, such as toothbrushes, razors, or nail clippers Using a latex condom during sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. If you think you have been in contact with the hepatitis B virus, see your health care provider right away. Your provider may give you a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine to prevent infection. In some cases, your provider may also give you a medicine called hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). You need to get the vaccine and the HBIG (if needed) as soon as possible after coming into contact with the virus. It is best if you can get them within 24 hours.

Hepatitis C,https://medlineplus.gov/hepatitisc.html,"What is hepatitis C? Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. Inflammation is swelling that happens when tissues of the body are injured or infected. Inflammation can damage organs. There are different types of hepatitis. One type, hepatitis C, is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis C can range from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C can be acute or chronic: Acute hepatitis C is a short-term infection. The symptoms can last up to 6 months. Sometimes your body is able to fight off the infection and the virus goes away. But for most people, an acute infection leads to chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis C is a long-lasting infection. If it is not treated, it can last for a lifetime and cause serious health problems, including liver damage, cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver cancer , and even death. How is hepatitis C spread? Hepatitis C spreads through contact with the blood of someone who has HCV. This contact may be through: Sharing drug needles or other drug materials with someone who has HCV. In the United States, this is the most common way that people get hepatitis C. Getting an accidental stick with a needle that was used on someone who has HCV. This can happen in health care settings. Being tattooed or pierced with tools or inks that were not sterilized after being used on someone who has HCV. Having contact with the blood or open sores of someone who has HCV. Sharing personal care items that may have come in contact with another person's blood, such as razors or toothbrushes. Being born to a mother with HCV. Having unprotected sex with someone who has HCV. Before 1992, hepatitis C was also commonly spread through blood transfusions and organ transplants. Since then, there has been routine testing of the U.S. blood supply for HCV. It is now very rare for someone to get HCV this way. Who is more likely to get hepatitis C? You are more likely to get hepatitis C if you: Have injected drugs Had a blood transfusion or organ transplant before July 1992 Have hemophilia and received clotting factor before 1987 Have been on kidney dialysis Have been in contact with blood or infected needles at work Have had tattoos or body piercings Have worked or lived in a prison Were born to a mother with hepatitis C Have HIV Have had more than one sex partner in the last 6 months Have had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) Are a man who has had sex with men (MSM) If you are at high risk for hepatitis C, your health care provider will likely recommend that you get tested for it. What are the symptoms of hepatitis C? Most people with hepatitis C have no symptoms. Some people with acute hepatitis C do have symptoms within 1 to 3 months after they are exposed to the virus. These symptoms may include: Dark yellow urine Fatigue Fever Gray- or clay-colored stools Joint pain Loss of appetite Nausea and/or vomiting Pain in your abdomen (belly) Jaundice (yellowish eyes and skin) If you have chronic hepatitis C, you probably will not have symptoms until it causes complications. This can happen decades after you were infected. For this reason, hepatitis C screening is important, even if you have no symptoms. What other problems can hepatitis C cause? Without treatment, hepatitis C may lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. Early diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C can prevent these complications. How is hepatitis C diagnosed? Providers diagnose hepatitis C based on your medical history, a physical exam, and blood tests. If you do have hepatitis C, you may need additional tests to check for liver damage. These tests may include other blood tests, an ultrasound of the liver, and a liver biopsy . What are the treatments for hepatitis C? Treatment for hepatitis C is with antiviral medicines. They can cure the disease in most cases. If you have acute hepatitis C, your provider may wait to see if your infection becomes chronic before starting treatment. If your hepatitis C causes cirrhosis, you should see a doctor who specializes in liver diseases. Treatments for health problems related to cirrhosis include medicines, surgery, and other medical procedures. If your hepatitis C leads to liver failure or liver cancer, you may need a liver transplant . Can hepatitis C be prevented? There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. But you can help protect yourself from hepatitis C infection by: Not sharing drug needles or other drug materials. Wearing gloves if you have to touch another person's blood or open sores. Making sure your tattoo artist or body piercer uses sterile tools and unopened ink. Not sharing personal items such toothbrushes, razors, or nail clippers. Using a latex condom during sex.

Hernia,https://medlineplus.gov/hernia.html,"A hernia happens when part of an internal organ or tissue bulges through a weak area of muscle. Most hernias are in the abdomen. There are several types of hernias, including: Inguinal, in the groin. This is the the most common type. Umbilical, around the belly button Incisional, through a scar Hiatal , a small opening in the diaphragm that allows the upper part of the stomach to move up into the chest. Congenital diaphragmatic, a birth defect that needs surgery Hernias are common. They can affect men, women, and children.  A combination of muscle weakness and straining, such as with heavy lifting, might contribute. Some people are born with weak abdominal muscles and may be more likely to get a hernia. Treatment is usually surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. Untreated hernias can cause pain and health problems.",MedlinePlus
Herniated Disk,https://medlineplus.gov/herniateddisk.html,"Your backbone, or spine, is made up of 26 bones called vertebrae. In between them are soft disks filled with a jelly-like substance. These disks cushion the vertebrae and keep them in place. As you age, the disks break down or degenerate. As they do, they lose their cushioning ability. This can lead to pain if the back is stressed. A herniated disk is a disk that ruptures. This allows the jelly-like center of the disk to leak, irritating the nearby nerves. This can cause sciatica or back pain . Your doctor will diagnose a herniated disk with a physical exam and, sometimes, imaging tests. With treatment, most people recover. Treatments include rest, pain and anti-inflammatory medicines, physical therapy, and sometimes surgery. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases",MedlinePlus
Heroin,https://medlineplus.gov/heroin.html,"What is heroin? Heroin is an illegal, very addictive opioid drug . It's made from morphine, which comes from the seedpod of opium poppy plants. These plants grow in Southeast and Southwest Asia, Mexico, and Colombia. Heroin can be a white or brown powder, or a black sticky substance known as black tar heroin. How do people use heroin? People inject, sniff, snort, or smoke heroin. Some people mix heroin with crack cocaine , which is called ""speedballing."" All these ways of taking heroin send it to the brain very quickly, which makes it highly addictive. What are the short-term effects of heroin? People who use heroin report feeling a ""rush"" (a surge of pleasure). And then they may feel other effects, such as a warm flushing of the skin, dry mouth , and a heavy feeling in the arms and legs. They may also have severe itching , nausea, and vomiting . After these first effects, they will usually be drowsy for several hours, and their breathing will slow down. What are the long-term effects of heroin? People who use heroin over the long term may develop many different health problems. These problems could include liver , kidney , and lung disease, mental disorders , and abscesses . People who inject the drug also risk getting infectious diseases such as HIV , hepatitis , and bacterial infections of the skin, bloodstream, and heart ( endocarditis ). They can also get collapsed veins. When a vein collapses, the blood cannot flow through it. Repeated use of heroin can lead to tolerance. This means users need more and more of the drug to have the same effect. At higher doses over time, the body becomes dependent on heroin.  If someone who is dependent on heroin stops using it, they have withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms can include restlessness, muscle and bone pain, diarrhea , vomiting, and cold flashes with goose bumps. Repeated use of heroin often leads to heroin use disorder, sometimes called addiction. This is more than physical dependence. It's a chronic (long-lasting) brain disorder. When someone has it, they continue to use heroin even though it causes problems in their life. Some examples include health problems and not being able to meet responsibilities at work, school, or home. Getting and using heroin becomes their main purpose in life. Can a person overdose on heroin? It's possible to overdose on heroin. This happens when a person uses so much heroin that it causes a life-threatening reaction or death. All heroin users are at risk of an overdose because they never know the actual strength of the drug they are taking or what may have been added to it. And people often use heroin along with other drugs or alcohol. This can increase the risk of an overdose. When people overdose on heroin, their heart rate and breathing slow down. Their breathing may slow do so much that not enough oxygen reaches the brain. This condition is called hypoxia. Hypoxia can lead to a coma , permanent brain damage, or death. How can a heroin overdose be treated? A medicine called naloxone can treat a heroin (or other opioid) overdose if it is given in time. It works by blocking the effects of the opioid on the body. Sometimes more than one dose of the medicine is needed. There are two forms of naloxone that anyone can use without medical training: nasal spray and injectable. People at risk of an overdose are encouraged to carry naloxone with them. They can buy naloxone at a pharmacy. What are the treatments for heroin use disorder? Treatments for heroin use disorder include medicines to treat withdrawal symptoms, medicine to block the effects of opioids, and behavioral treatments. Often, a combination of medicine and behavioral treatment works best. People getting treatment for heroin use disorder should work with their health care providers to come up with a treatment plan that fits their needs.

Hiatal Hernia,https://medlineplus.gov/hiatalhernia.html,"A hiatal hernia is a condition in which the upper part of your stomach bulges through an opening in your diaphragm. Your diaphragm is the thin muscle that separates your chest from your abdomen. Your diaphragm helps keep acid from coming up into your esophagus. When you have a hiatal hernia, it's easier for the acid to come up. This leaking of acid from your stomach into your esophagus is called GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). GERD may cause symptoms such as : Heartburn Problems swallowing A dry cough Bad breath Nausea and/or vomiting Breathing problems The wearing away of your teeth Often, the cause of a hiatal hernia is unknown. It may have to do with weakness in the surrounding muscles. Sometimes the cause is an injury or a birth defect. Your risk of getting a hiatal hernia goes up as you age; they are common in people over age 50. You are also at higher risk if you have obesity or smoke. People usually find out that they have a hiatal hernia when they are getting tests for GERD, heartburn, chest pain , or abdominal pain . The tests may be a chest x-ray, an x-ray with a barium swallow, or an upper endoscopy. You don't need treatment if your hiatal hernia does not cause any symptoms or problems. If you do have symptoms, some lifestyle changes may help. They include eating small meals, avoiding certain foods, not smoking or drinking alcohol, and losing weight.

Hidradenitis Suppurativa,https://medlineplus.gov/hidradenitissuppurativa.html,"What is hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)? Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic skin disease. Another name for it is acne inversa. It causes painful, boil-like lumps that form under the skin. It often affects areas where the skin rubs together, such as your armpits and groin. The lumps become inflamed and painful. They often break open, causing abscesses that drain fluid and pus. As the abscesses heal, they can cause scarring of the skin. What causes hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)? The lumps in HS form because of blockages of the hair follicles. The blocked hair follicles trap bacteria, which leads to inflammation and rupture. In most cases, the cause of the blockages is unknown. Genetics, environment, and hormonal factors may play a role. Some cases of HS are caused by changes in certain genes . HS is not caused by bad hygiene, and it cannot be spread to others. Who is more likely to get hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)? HS usually starts after puberty, usually in the teens or twenties. It is more common in: Women People who are Black People with a family history of HS People who are overweight or have obesity People who smoke What are the symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)? The symptoms of HS include: Small pitted areas of skin containing blackheads Painful, red, lumps that get bigger and break open. This causes abscesses that drain fluid and pus. They may itch and have an unpleasant odor. The abscesses heal very slowly, recur over time, and can lead to scarring and tunnels under the skin. HS can be mild, moderate, or severe: In mild HS, there are only one or a few lumps in one area of the skin. A mild case will often get worse, becoming a moderate disease. Moderate HS includes recurrences of the lumps that get bigger and break open. The lumps form in more than one area of the body. With severe HS, there are widespread lumps, scarring, and chronic pain that may make it hard to move. Because of the difficulty of dealing with the disease, people with HS are at risk for depression and anxiety . How is hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) diagnosed? There is no specific test for HS. It can be hard to diagnose in the early stages because it can look like pimples or acne . To make a diagnosis, your health care provider: Will ask about your medical history and your symptoms Will look at the lumps on your skin May take a sample of the skin or pus (if there is any) and send it to a lab to be tested Your provider may refer you to a dermatologist (skin doctor) to get a diagnosis or treatment. What are the treatments for hidradenitis suppurativa? There is no cure for HS. Treatments focus on the symptoms, but they are not always effective for everyone. The treatments depend on how severe the disease is and may include: Medicines , including steroids , antibiotics , pain relievers , and medicines that flight inflammation. In mild cases, the medicines may be topical (applied to your skin). Otherwise, the medicines may be injected or taken orally (by mouth).

High Blood Pressure,https://medlineplus.gov/highbloodpressure.html,"What is blood pressure? Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. For example, 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80. How is high blood pressure diagnosed? High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. They will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis. Blood Pressure Category Systolic Blood Pressure Diastolic Blood Pressure Normal Less than 120 and Less than 80 Elevated 120 - 129 and Less than 80 High Blood Pressure Stage 1 130 - 139 or 80 - 89 High Blood Pressure Stage 2 140 or higher or 90 or higher Hypertensive Crisis (dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away) Higher than 180 and Higher than 120 For children and teens, the health care provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age, height, and sex. What are the different types of high blood pressure? There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure.: Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. For most people who get this kind of blood pressure, it develops over time as you get older. Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. It usually gets better after you treat that condition or stop taking the medicines that are causing it. Why do I need to worry about high blood pressure? When your blood pressure stays high over time, it causes the heart to pump harder and work overtime, possibly leading to serious health problems such as heart attack , stroke , heart failure , and kidney failure . What are the treatments for high blood pressure? Treatments for high blood pressure include heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines . You will work with your provider to come up with a treatment plan. It may include only the lifestyle changes. These changes, such as heart-healthy eating and exercise, can be very effective. But sometimes the changes do not control or lower your high blood pressure. Then you may need to take medicine. There are different types of blood pressure medicines. Some people need to take more than one type. If your high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or medicine, treating that condition or stopping the medicine may lower your blood pressure.

High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy,https://medlineplus.gov/highbloodpressureinpregnancy.html,"What is high blood pressure in pregnancy? Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Your arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to other parts of your body. High blood pressure , or hypertension, is blood pressure that is higher than normal. Having high blood pressure can put you at risk for other health problems, such as heart disease , heart attack , and stroke . During pregnancy, high blood pressure can cause problems for you and your baby. To keep you and your baby healthy, it's important to get treatment for high blood pressure before, during, and after pregnancy. What are the types of high blood pressure in pregnancy? There are different types of high blood pressure in pregnancy: Gestational hypertension is high blood pressure that you develop while you are pregnant. It starts after you are 20 weeks pregnant. You usually don't have any other symptoms. In many cases, it does not harm you or your baby, and it goes away within 12 weeks after childbirth. But it does raise your risk of high blood pressure in the future. If it becomes severe, it can lead to a preterm birth or your baby having a low birth weight . Some women with gestational hypertension do go on to develop preeclampsia, a more serious type of high blood pressure in pregnancy. Chronic hypertension is high blood pressure that starts before the 20th week of pregnancy or before you became pregnant. Some people may have had it long before becoming pregnant but didn't know it until they got their blood pressure checked at their prenatal visit . Sometimes chronic hypertension can also lead to preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It usually happens in the last trimester. Preeclampsia also often includes signs of damage to some of your organs, such as your liver or kidneys. The signs may include protein in the urine (pee) and very high blood pressure. Preeclampsia can be serious or even life-threatening for both you and your baby. If preeclampsia becomes severe enough to affect your brain function and causes seizures or a coma , it is called eclampsia . In rare cases, preeclampsia symptoms may not start until after delivery. This is called postpartum preeclampsia . If this type of preeclampsia becomes more severe and causes a seizure, it is known as postpartum eclampsia . When a person with preeclampsia or eclampsia has damage to the liver and blood cells, it's called HELLP syndrome . It is rare, but very serious. Who is more likely to develop high blood pressure in pregnancy? You are more likely to develop high blood pressure in pregnancy if you: Had chronic high blood pressure or chronic kidney disease before pregnancy Had high blood pressure or preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy Have obesity Are under age 20 or over age 40 Are pregnant with more than one baby Are African American Have a family history of high blood pressure in pregnancy Have certain health conditions, such as diabetes or lupus What are the symptoms of high blood pressure in pregnancy? High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. People usually find out they have high blood pressure when their health care provider measures their blood pressure . Preeclampsia can cause other symptoms, including: Too much protein in your urine (called proteinuria). Swelling ( edema ) in your face and hands. Your feet may also swell, but many women have swollen feet during pregnancy. So swollen feet by themselves may not be a sign of a problem. A headache that does not go away. Vision problems, including blurred vision or seeing spots. Pain in your upper right abdomen (belly). Trouble breathing . Eclampsia can also cause seizures, nausea and/or vomiting , and low urine output. If you go on to develop HELLP syndrome , you may also have bleeding or bruising easily, extreme fatigue , and liver failure. What problems can high blood pressure in pregnancy cause? High blood pressure in pregnancy can lead to complications such as: Placental abruption, where the placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby) separates from the uterus (the place where a baby grows during pregnancy) Poor fetal growth, caused by a lack of nutrients and oxygen Preterm birth Your baby having a low birth weight Damage to your kidneys, liver, brain, and other organ and blood systems A higher risk of heart disease for you How is high blood pressure in pregnancy diagnosed? Your provider will check your blood pressure and urine at each prenatal visit. If your blood pressure reading is high (140/90 or higher), especially after the 20th week of pregnancy, your provider will likely want to order some tests. These may include blood tests and other lab tests, such as a test to look for extra protein in your urine . What are the treatments for high blood pressure in pregnancy? If you have high blood pressure, you and your baby will be closely monitored to lower the chance of complications. You may need to: Check your blood pressure at home. Keep track of how many times you feel the baby kicking each day. Adjust your physical activity. Talk to your provider about what level of physical activity is right for you. Take medicine to control your blood pressure. Talk to your provider about which medicines are safe for your baby. Take aspirin in the second trimester, if you are at risk of preeclampsia and your provider recommends aspirin. Visit your provider more often to monitor your condition and your baby's growth rate and heart rate. If you have eclampsia , HELLP syndrome , or a severe case of preeclampsia , you will most likely need to go to the hospital. Treatment often includes medicines. Your provider may also recommend delivering the baby early. They will make the decision based on: How severe the condition is The possible risks to you and your baby How far along the pregnancy is The goal is to lower the risks to you while giving your baby as much time as possible to mature before delivery. The symptoms of preeclampsia can last after delivery, but they usually go away within 6 weeks.",MedlinePlus
High Cholesterol in Children and Teens,https://medlineplus.gov/highcholesterolinchildrenandteens.html,"What is cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in the body. The liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. The body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if your child or teen has high cholesterol (too much cholesterol in the blood), it can stick to the walls of their arteries and narrow or even block the arteries. This can put your child or teen at risk of coronary artery disease and other heart diseases . What causes high cholesterol in children and teens? Three main factors contribute to high cholesterol in children and teens: An unhealthy diet, especially one that is high in saturated fats A family history of high cholesterol, especially when one or both parents have high cholesterol Having obesity Some diseases, such as diabetes , kidney disease , and certain thyroid diseases , can also cause high cholesterol in children and teens. What are the symptoms of high cholesterol in children and teens? There are usually no signs or symptoms that your child or teen has high cholesterol. How do I know if my child or teen has high cholesterol? There is a blood test to measure cholesterol levels. The test gives information about: Total cholesterol . This is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood. It includes both low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol. LDL cholesterol. LDL is often called ""bad"" cholesterol because it is the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockage in the arteries. HDL cholesterol. HDL is often called ""good"" cholesterol because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. Non-HDL. This number is your total cholesterol minus your HDL. Your non-HDL includes LDL and other types of cholesterol such as VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein). Triglycerides . This is another type of fat in your blood that can raise the risk of heart disease. For anyone aged 19 or younger, the healthy levels of cholesterol are Type of Cholesterol Healthy Level Total Cholesterol Less than 170 mg/dL Non-HDL Less than 120 mg/dL LDL Less than 110 mg/dL HDL More than 45 mg/dL When and how often your child or teen should get this test depends on their age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are: The first test should be between ages 9 to 11 Children should have the test again every 5 years Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high cholesterol, heart attack , or stroke What are the treatments for high cholesterol in children and teens? Lifestyle changes are the main treatment for high cholesterol in children and teens. These changes include: Being more active. This includes getting regular physical activity and spending less time sitting (in front of a television, at a computer, on a phone or tablet, etc.). Healthy eating. A diet to lower cholesterol includes limiting foods that are high in saturated fat, sugar, and cholesterol. It is also important to eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Losing weight, if your child or teen is overweight or has obesity. If everyone in the family makes these changes, it will be easier for your child or teen to stick to them. It is also an opportunity to improve your health, and the health of the rest of your family. Sometimes these lifestyle changes are not enough to lower your child or teen's cholesterol. Their health care provider may consider giving your child or teen cholesterol medicines if they: Are at least 10 years old. Have an LDL (bad) cholesterol level that is higher than 190 mg/dL, even after six months of diet and exercise changes. Have an LDL (bad) cholesterol level that is higher than 160 mg/dL AND are at high risk for heart disease. Have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).

Hip Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/hipinjuriesanddisorders.html,"Your hip is the joint where your femur (thigh bone) meets your pelvis (hip bone). There are two main parts: a ball at the end of the femur, which fits in a socket in the pelvis. Your hip is known as a ball-and-socket joint. This is because you have a ball at the end of your femur, and it fits into a socket in your pelvis. This makes your hips very stable and allows for a wide range of motion. When they are healthy, it takes great force to hurt them. However, playing sports, running, overuse, or falling can sometimes lead to hip injuries such as: Strains Bursitis Dislocations Fractures (broken bones) Certain diseases also lead to hip injuries or problems. Osteoarthritis can cause pain 
and limited motion. Osteoporosis of the hip causes weak bones that break easily. Both of 
these are common in older people. Another problem is hip dysplasia, where the ball at the end of the femur is loose in the hip socket. It can cause hip dislocation. Babies who have hip dysplasia are usually born with it, but sometimes they develop it later. Treatment for hip disorders may include rest, medicines, physical therapy, or surgery, including hip replacement .",MedlinePlus
Hip Replacement,https://medlineplus.gov/hipreplacement.html,"Hip replacement is surgery for people with severe hip damage. The most common cause of damage is osteoarthritis . Osteoarthritis causes pain, swelling, and reduced motion in your joints. It can interfere with your daily activities. If other treatments such as physical therapy, pain medicines, and exercise haven't helped, hip replacement surgery might be an option for you. During a hip replacement operation, the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and bone from your hip joint and replaces them with new, man-made parts. A hip replacement can: Relieve pain Help your hip joint work better Improve walking and other movements The most common problem after surgery is hip dislocation. Because a man-made hip is smaller than the original joint, the ball can come out of its socket. The surgery can also cause blood clots and infections. With a hip replacement, you might need to avoid certain activities, such as jogging and high-impact sports. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin

Histoplasmosis,https://medlineplus.gov/histoplasmosis.html,"What is histoplasmosis? Histoplasmosis is an infection caused by a fungus called Histoplasma . This fungus is common in the central and eastern United States, especially around the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. It can also be found in parts of Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. It lives in the environment, especially in soil that contains large amounts of bat or bird droppings (poop). How do you get histoplasmosis? You get histoplasmosis by breathing in Histoplasma fungal spores from the air. It usually happens after you have been doing an activity that disturbs the soil, such as farming, construction, and landscaping. Histoplasmosis is not contagious. This means that you cannot get the infection from another person or an animal. What are the symptoms of histoplasmosis? Most people who breathe in the spores never have any symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they usually start between 3 and 17 days after you breathe in the spores. The symptoms may include: Fever Cough Fatigue Chills Headache Chest pain Body aches For most people, the symptoms of histoplasmosis will go away within a few weeks to a month. However, some people can have symptoms that last longer, especially if their infection becomes severe. Certain people are more likely to get a severe infection: People who have weakened immune systems , for example from: Having HIV Having had an organ transplant Taking medicines which weaken your immune system, such as chemotherapy and steroids Infants Adults age 55 and over Severe histoplasmosis can develop into a long-term lung infection. It can also spread from the lungs to other parts of the body, such as the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). This is known as disseminated histoplasmosis. How is histoplasmosis diagnosed? To find out if you have histoplasmosis, your health care provider: Will ask about your symptoms and your medical and travel history Will do a physical exam Will likely order a blood, urine, or tissue test to look for signs of the fungus May order a chest x-ray or CT scan of the lungs What are the treatments for histoplasmosis? For some people, the symptoms of histoplasmosis will go away without treatment. But you will need treatment if you have severe histoplasmosis in the lungs, chronic histoplasmosis, or an infection that has spread to other parts of the body. That treatment would be with prescription antifungal medicines. In some cases, you may need to take the medicines for 3 months to 1 year. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus
HIV,https://medlineplus.gov/hiv.html,"What is HIV? HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. HIV harms your immune system by destroying a type of white blood cell that helps your body fight infection. This puts you at risk for other infections and diseases. What is AIDS? AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. It happens when the body's immune system is badly damaged because of the virus. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS. How does HIV spread? HIV is spread through certain body fluids from a person who has HIV. This can happen: By having unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a person who has HIV. ""Unprotected"" means not using condoms or medicine to treat or prevent HIV. This is the most common way that it spreads. By sharing drug needles. Through contact with the blood of a person with HIV. From mother to fetus during pregnancy . From mother to baby during, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Who is at risk for HIV infection? Anyone can get HIV, but certain groups have a higher risk of getting it: People who have another sexually transmitted infection (STI). Having an STI can increase your risk of getting or spreading HIV. People who inject drugs with shared needles. Gay and bisexual men. Black/African Americans and Hispanic/Latino Americans. They make up a higher proportion of new HIV diagnoses and people with HIV, compared to other races and ethnicities. People who engage in risky sexual behaviors, such as not using condoms or medicine to prevent or treat HIV. Factors such as stigma, discrimination, income, education, and geographic region can also affect people's risk for HIV. What are the symptoms of HIV? The first signs of HIV infection may be flu-like symptoms: Fever Chills Rash Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep) Muscle aches Sore throat Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes Mouth ulcers These symptoms may come and go within two to four weeks. This stage is called acute HIV infection. If the infection is not treated, it becomes chronic HIV infection. Often, there are no symptoms during this stage. If it is not treated, eventually the virus will weaken your body's immune system. Then the infection will progress to AIDS. This is the late stage of HIV infection. Because your immune system is badly damaged, your body cannot fight off other infections, called opportunistic infections (OIs). OIs are infections that happen more frequently or are more severe in people who have weakened immune systems. Some people may not feel sick during the earlier stages of HIV infection. So the only way to know for sure whether you have HIV is to get tested. How do I know if I have HIV? A blood test can tell if you have HIV infection. Your health care provider can do the test, or you can use a home testing kit. You can also use the CDC Testing Locator to find free testing sites. What are the treatments for HIV? There is no cure for HIV infection, but it can be treated with medicines. This is called antiretroviral therapy (ART).  ART can make HIV infection a manageable chronic condition. It also reduces the risk of spreading the virus to others. Most people with HIV live long and healthy lives if they get ART as soon as possible and stay on it. It's also important to take care of yourself. Making sure that you have the support you need, living a healthy lifestyle, and getting regular medical care can help you enjoy a better quality of life . Can HIV infection be prevented? You can reduce the risk of getting or spreading HIV by: Getting tested for HIV. Choosing less risky sexual behaviors. This includes limiting the number of sexual partners you have and using latex condoms every time you have sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. Getting tested and treated for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Not injecting drugs. Talking to your provider about medicines to prevent HIV : PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is for people who don't already have HIV but are at very high risk of getting it. PrEP is daily medicine that can reduce this risk. PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) is for people who have possibly been exposed to HIV. It is only for emergency situations. PEP must be started within 72 hours after a possible exposure to HIV. NIH: National Institutes of Health",MedlinePlus
HIV and Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/hivandinfections.html,"What are opportunistic infections (OIs) in HIV? Having HIV weakens your body's immune system. It destroys the white blood cells that fight infection. This puts you at risk for opportunistic infections (OIs). OIs are serious infections that take advantage of your weak immune system. These infections are less common and less severe in healthy people. People who have AIDS, the most severe stage of HIV infection, have badly damaged immune systems. This puts them especially at risk for OIs. Getting certain OIs is one of the ways that people can get diagnosed with AIDS. OIs are becoming less common in people with HIV because of effective HIV medicines . But some people with HIV still develop OIs for different reasons: They may not know they have HIV, so they aren't getting treatment for it They know that they have HIV but are not taking treatment Their HIV treatment may not be working properly What are the different types of opportunistic infections (OIs)? There are many types of OIs: Bacterial infections , including tuberculosis , Salmonella infection , and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) Viral infections , such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) Fungal infections , like yeast infections , Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), and histoplasmosis Parasitic infections , such as cryptosporidiosis and toxoplasmosis Having HIV can make infections harder to treat. People with HIV are also more likely to have complications from common illnesses such as the flu. What are the treatments for opportunistic infections (OIs)? If you develop an OI, there are treatments available such as antiviral, antibiotic , and antifungal drugs. The type of medicine your health care provider prescribes will depend on which OI you have. After the OI has been successfully treated, you may still need to take the same medicine or another medicine to prevent the OI from coming back. Can opportunistic infections (OIs) be prevented? The best way to prevent OIs infections is by taking your HIV medicines. Other steps you can take to help prevent OIs include: Avoiding exposure to contaminated food and water : Don't undercooked eggs, unpasteurized dairy products or fruit juices, or raw seed sprouts Don't drink water directly from a lake or river Talking to your provider about medicines and vaccines that prevent certain OIs Preventing exposure to other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) by using condoms every time you have sex Washing your hands thoroughly with warm, soapy water after any contact with human or animal feces (poop) Not sharing needles, syringes, or other drug injection equipment",MedlinePlus

If you are pregnant and have HIV, there is a risk of passing HIV to your baby. It can happen in three ways: During pregnancy During childbirth, especially if it is vaginal childbirth During breastfeeding But having HIV doesn't mean that you can't have children. Treatment with a combination of HIV medicines can help prevent passing HIV to your baby and protect your own health. If I have HIV, how can I prevent giving it to my baby? There are several different steps you can take to help prevent passing HIV to your baby: Taking HIV medicines . HIV medicines reduce the amount of HIV in the body (viral load) to a very low level. The goal is to get your viral load so low that a standard lab test can't detect it. This is called having an ""undetectable viral load."" Having an undetectable viral load is the best thing you can do to stay healthy and prevent your baby from getting HIV. These medicines will also help protect your health. Most HIV medicines are safe to use during pregnancy. They don't usually raise the risk of birth defects . But it is important to talk with your health care provider about the risks and benefits of the different medicines. Together you can decide which medicines are right for you. Then you need to make sure you take your medicines regularly. If needed, having a cesarean delivery . If your viral load is not reduced enough by the medicines, having a cesarean delivery (C-Section) can help prevent passing HIV to your baby. Giving HIV medicines to the baby. Your baby will get HIV medicines as soon as possible after birth. The medicines protect your baby from infection from any HIV that passed from you during childbirth. Which medicine your baby gets depends on several factors, including what your viral load was just before you gave birth. Your baby will need to take medicines for 4 to 6 weeks. He or she will get several HIV tests over the first few months. Not breastfeeding. Breast milk can have HIV in it. In the United States, infant formula is safe and readily available. So the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that if you have HIV, you should feed your baby formula instead of breastfeeding. What if I want to get pregnant and my partner has HIV? If you are trying to get pregnant, it's important for your partner to also get tested for HIV. If your partner does have HIV and you do not, talk to your provider about taking PrEP . PrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. This means taking medicines to prevent HIV.

People who get early treatment can live longer and healthier lives .",MedlinePlus
HIV Medicines,https://medlineplus.gov/hivmedicines.html,"What is HIV? HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It harms your immune system by destroying CD4 cells. These are a type of white blood cells that fight infection. The loss of these cells makes it hard for your body to fight off infections and certain HIV-related cancers. Without treatment, HIV can gradually destroy the immune system and advance to AIDS. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS. What is antiretroviral therapy (ART)? The treatment of HIV with medicines is called antiretroviral therapy (ART). It involves taking a combination of medicines every day. ART is recommended for everyone who has HIV. The medicines do not cure HIV infection, but help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. They also reduce the risk of spreading the virus to others. How do HIV medicines work? HIV medicines reduce the amount of HIV (viral load) in your body, which helps by: Giving your immune system a chance to recover. Even though there is still some HIV in your body, your immune system should be strong enough to fight off infections and certain HIV-related cancers. Reducing the risk that you will spread HIV to others. What are the types of HIV medicines? There are many different types (called classes) of HIV medicines. Some work by blocking or changing enzymes that HIV needs to make copies of itself. This prevents HIV from copying itself, which reduces the amount of HIV in the body. Several types of medicines do this: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) block an enzyme called reverse transcriptase Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) bind to and later change reverse transcriptase Integrase inhibitors , also called integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), block an enzyme called integrase Protease inhibitors (PIs) block an enzyme called protease Some types of HIV medicines interfere with HIV's ability to infect CD4 immune system cells: Fusion inhibitors block HIV from entering the cells CCR5 antagonists and post-attachment inhibitors block different molecules on the CD4 cells. To infect a cell, HIV has to bind to two types of molecules on the cell's surface. Blocking either of these molecules prevents HIV from entering the cells. Attachment inhibitors bind to a specific protein on the outer surface of HIV. This prevents HIV from entering the cell. Pharmacokinetic enhancers are another type of medicine. They are sometimes taken along with certain other HIV medicines. Pharmacokinetic enhancers increase the effectiveness of the other medicine. They work by slowing the breakdown of the other medicine. This allows that medicine to stay in the body longer at a higher concentration. There are also multidrug combinations , which include a combination of two or more different types of HIV medicines. When do I need to start taking HIV medicines? It's important to start taking HIV medicines as soon as possible after your diagnosis, especially if you: Are pregnant Have AIDS Have certain HIV-related illnesses and infections Have an early HIV infection (the first 6 months after infection with HIV) What else do I need to know about taking HIV medicines? You and your health care provider will work together to come up with a personal treatment plan. This plan will be based on many factors, including: The possible side effects of HIV medicines Potential drug interactions with any other medicines you take How many medicines you will need to take every day Any other health problems you may have It's important to take your medicines every day, according to the instructions from your provider. If you miss doses or don't follow a regular schedule, your treatment may not work, and the HIV virus may become resistant to the medicines. HIV medicines can cause side effects. Most of these side effects are manageable, but a few can be serious. Tell your provider about any side effects that you are having. Don't stop taking your medicine without first talking to your provider. There may be steps you can take to help manage the side effects. In some cases, your provider may decide to change your medicines. What are HIV PrEP and PEP medicines? HIV medicines are not just used for treatment. Some people take them to prevent HIV .

HIV: PrEP and PEP,https://medlineplus.gov/hivprepandpep.html,"What are PrEP and PEP? PrEP and PEP are medicines to prevent HIV . Each type is used in a different situation: PrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. It is for people who don't already have HIV but are at risk of getting it. PrEP is medicine that can reduce this risk. It can either be a pill that you take every day or an injection that you get every two months. With PrEP, if you do get exposed to HIV, the medicine can stop HIV from taking hold and spreading throughout your body. PEP stands for post-exposure prophylaxis. PEP is for people who have possibly been exposed to HIV. It is only for emergency situations. PEP must be started within 72 hours after a possible exposure to HIV. PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) Who should consider taking PrEP? PrEP can help protect you if you don't have HIV and any of these applies to you: You have had anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and: Have a sexual partner with HIV, Have not consistently used a condom, OR Have been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the past 6 months You inject drugs and: Share needles or other equipment to inject drugs OR Have an injection partner with HIV You have been prescribed PEP and: Continue engaging in high-risk behaviors OR Have used multiple courses of PEP If you have a partner who is HIV-positive and are considering getting pregnant, talk to your health care provider about PrEP. Taking it may help protect you and your baby from getting HIV infection while you try to get pregnant, during pregnancy , or while breastfeeding. How well does PrEP work? PrEP is very effective when you take it consistently. It reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99%. In people who inject drugs, it reduces the risk of HIV by at least 74%. PrEP is much less effective if you do not take it consistently. PrEP does not protect against other STIs, so you should still use latex condoms every time you have sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. You must have an HIV test every 3 months while taking PrEP, so you'll have regular follow-up visits with your provider. If you are having trouble taking PrEP every day or if you want to stop taking PrEP, talk to your provider. Does PrEP cause side effects? Some people taking PrEP may have side effects, like nausea. The side effects are usually not serious and often get better over time. If you are taking PrEP, tell your provider if you have a side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) Who should consider taking PEP? If you are HIV-negative and you think you may have been recently exposed to HIV, contact your health care provider immediately or go to an emergency room right away. You may be prescribed PEP if you are HIV negative or don't know your HIV status, and in the last 72 hours you may have been exposed to HIV: During sex, for example if a condom broke during sex with someone who could have HIV, Through the sharing of needles or drug preparation equipment, OR Through sexual assault Your provider or emergency room doctor will help to decide whether PEP is right for you. PEP may also be given to a health care worker after a possible exposure to HIV at work, for example, from a needlestick injury. When should I start PEP and how long do I need to take it? PEP must be started within 72 hours (3 days) after a possible exposure to HIV. The sooner you start it, the better; every hour counts. You need to take the PEP medicines every day for 28 days. You will have to see your provider at certain times during and after taking the PEP, so you can have an HIV screening test and other testing. Does PEP cause side effects? Some people taking PEP may have side effects, like nausea. The side effects are usually not serious and often get better over time. If you are taking PEP, tell your provider if you have a side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. PEP medicines may also interact with other medicines that a person is taking (called a drug interaction ). So it's important to tell your provider about any other medicines that you take. Can I take PEP every time I have unprotected sex? PEP is only for emergency situations. It is not the right choice for people who may be exposed to HIV frequently - for example, if you often have sex without a condom with a partner who is HIV-positive.

Hormone Replacement Therapy,https://medlineplus.gov/hormonereplacementtherapy.html,"Menopause is the time in a woman's life when her period stops. It is a normal part of aging.  In the years before and during menopause, the levels of female hormones can go up and down. This can cause symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, pain during sex, and vaginal dryness. For some women, the symptoms are mild, and they go away on their own. Other women take hormone replacement therapy (HRT), also called menopausal hormone therapy, to relieve these symptoms. HRT may also protect against osteoporosis . HRT is not for everyone. You should not use HRT if you: Think that you are pregnant Have problems with vaginal bleeding Have had certain kinds of cancers Have had a stroke or heart attack Have had blood clots Have liver disease There are different types of HRT. Some have only one hormone, while others have two. Most are pills that you take every day, but there are also skin patches, vaginal creams, gels, and rings. Taking HRT has some risks. For some women, hormone therapy may increase their chances of getting blood clots , heart attacks , strokes , breast cancer , and gallbladder disease . Certain types of HRT have a higher risk, and each woman's own risks can vary, depending upon her medical history and lifestyle. You and your health care provider need to discuss the risks and benefits for you. If you do decide to take HRT, it should be the lowest dose that helps and for the shortest time needed.

How to Lower Cholesterol,https://medlineplus.gov/howtolowercholesterol.html,"What is cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that that's found in all the cells in your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly.  But if you have too much of it in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases . Cholesterol is made by your liver. It travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type of lipoprotein, LDL , is sometimes called the ""bad"" cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Another type, HDL , is sometimes called the ""good"" cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Then your liver removes the cholesterol from your body. There are steps that you can take to lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol and raise your HDL (good) cholesterol. By keeping your cholesterol levels in range , you can lower your risk of heart diseases .

Early diagnosis and heart-healthy lifestyle changes can keep high blood pressure from seriously damaging your health. What is blood pressure? Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into your arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to the tissues and organs in your body). Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Blood pressure is measured as two numbers: Systolic pressure (the first and higher number) measures pressure inside your arteries when your heart beats Diastolic pressure (the second and lower number) measures the pressure inside your arteries when your heart rests between beats As an example, a blood pressure reading of 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80. How is high blood pressure diagnosed? High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. They will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis: Blood Pressure Category Systolic Blood Pressure Diastolic Blood Pressure Normal Less than 120 and Less than 80 Elevated 120 - 129 and Less than 80 High Blood Pressure Stage 1 130 - 139 or 80 - 89 High Blood Pressure Stage 2 140 or higher or 90 or higher Hypertensive Crisis (dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away) Higher than 180 and Higher than 120 For children and teens, the provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age, height, and sex. Who is more likely to develop high blood pressure? Anyone can develop high blood pressure, but there are certain factors that can increase your risk: Age. Blood pressure tends to rise with age. Race/Ethnicity . High blood pressure is more common in Black adults. They also tend to have higher average blood pressure numbers and get high blood pressure earlier in life. Sex.

Family history and genetics . High blood pressure often runs in families. Many genes are linked to small increases in high blood pressure risk. Social and economic factors: Research shows that factors such as income, education level, where you live, and the type of job you have may raise your risk of high blood pressure. For example, working early or late shifts can raise your risk. Experiencing discrimination and poverty has been linked to high blood pressure. Also, some research has shown that trauma in childhood may raise the risk of high blood pressure. Certain medicines. Some medicines can raise your blood pressure, including: Certain antidepressants Decongestants (medicines to relieve a stuffy nose) Hormonal birth control pills Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are a type of pain reliever Having certain other medical conditions, such as: Some tumors Chronic kidney disease Diabetes Metabolic syndrome Overweight and obesity Sleep apnea Thyroid problems How can I prevent high blood pressure?

HPV,https://medlineplus.gov/hpv.html,"What is HPV? Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of related viruses. They can cause warts on different parts of your body. There are more than 200 types. About 40 of them are spread through direct sexual contact with someone who has the virus. They can also spread through other intimate, skin-to-skin contact. Some of these types can cause cancer. There are two categories of sexually transmitted HPV. Low-risk HPV can cause warts on or around your genitals , anus, mouth, or throat. High-risk HPV can cause various cancers: Cervical cancer Anal cancer Some types of oral and throat cancer Vulvar cancer Vaginal cancer Penile cancer Most HPV infections go away on their own and don't cause cancer. But sometimes the infections last longer. When a high-risk HPV infection lasts for many years, it can lead to cell changes. If these changes are not treated, they may get worse over time and become cancer. Who is at risk for HPV infections? HPV infections are very common. Nearly all sexually active people are infected with HPV soon after they become sexually active. What are the symptoms of HPV infections? Some people develop warts from certain low-risk HPV infections, but the other types (including the high-risk types) have no symptoms. If a high-risk HPV infection lasts for many years and causes cell changes, you may have symptoms. You may also have symptoms if those cell changes develop into cancer. Which symptoms you have depends on which part of the body is affected. How are HPV infections diagnosed? Health care providers can usually diagnose warts by looking at them. For women, there are cervical cancer screening tests which can find changes in the cervix that might lead to cancer.  As part of the screening, women may have Pap tests , HPV tests , or both. What are the treatments for HPV infections? An HPV infection itself cannot be treated. There are medicines that you can apply to a wart. If they don't work, your health care provide could freeze, burn, or surgically remove it. There are treatments for the cell changes caused by infection with high-risk HPV. They include medicines that you apply to the area that is affected and various surgical procedures. People who have HPV-related cancers usually get the same types of treatment as people who have cancers that are not caused by HPV. An exception to this is for people who have certain oral and throat cancers. They may have different treatment options. Can HPV infections be prevented? Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading HPV. If your or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex. Vaccines can protect against several types of HPV, including some that can cause cancer. The vaccines provide the most protection when people get them before they are exposed to the virus. This means that it is best for people to get them before they become sexually active. NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus
Huntington's Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/huntingtonsdisease.html,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited disease that causes certain nerve cells in the brain to waste away. People are born with the defective gene, but symptoms usually don't appear until middle age. Early symptoms of HD may include uncontrolled movements, clumsiness, and balance problems. Later, HD can take away the ability to walk, talk, and swallow. Some people stop recognizing family members. Others are aware of their environment and are able to express emotions. If one of your parents has Huntington's disease, you have a 50% chance of getting it. A blood test can tell you if have the HD gene and will develop the disease.

Hydrocephalus,https://medlineplus.gov/hydrocephalus.html,"Hydrocephalus is the buildup of too much cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Normally, this fluid cushions your brain. When you have too much, though, it puts harmful pressure on your brain. Hydrocephalus can be congenital, or present at birth. Causes include genetic problems and problems with how the fetus develops. An unusually large head is the main sign of congenital hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus can also happen after birth. This is called acquired hydrocephalus. It can occur at any age. Causes can include head injuries, strokes, infections, tumors, and bleeding in the brain. Symptoms include: Headache Vomiting and nausea Blurry vision Balance problems Bladder control problems Thinking and memory problems Hydrocephalus can permanently damage the brain, causing problems with physical and mental development. If untreated, it is usually fatal. With treatment, many people lead normal lives with few limitations. Treatment usually involves surgery to insert a shunt.

Hyperglycemia,https://medlineplus.gov/hyperglycemia.html,"What is blood glucose? Blood glucose , or blood sugar, is the main sugar found in your blood. It is your body's primary source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy. For people with diabetes , your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. What is hyperglycemia? Hyperglycemia means high blood glucose. It most often affects people who have diabetes. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it the right way. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. What causes hyperglycemia? A key part of managing diabetes is controlling your blood glucose levels. To do this, you need to follow a diabetes meal plan and get regular physical activity . You might also need to take diabetes medicines. You have to balance all of these to keep your blood glucose at the right levels. But if you eat too much food or the wrong foods, don't take your medicines correctly, or don't get physical activity, you can get hyperglycemia. It can also happen if you are stressed or sick. Less commonly, people who don't have diabetes can also get hyperglycemia. It can be caused by conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood. They include problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands , certain medicines, and severe illnesses. What are the symptoms of hyperglycemia? The symptoms of hyperglycemia include: Feeling thirsty Feeling tired or weak Headaches Urinating (peeing) often Blurred vision If you are diabetic and you often have high blood glucose levels or the symptoms of hyperglycemia, talk with your health care team. You may need a change in your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, or diabetes medicines. If you don't have diabetes and you are having these symptoms, see your provider to find out the cause and how to treat it. What other problems can hyperglycemia cause? If hyperglycemia is not treated, it can cause other problems. In people with diabetes, long-term hyperglycemia can lead to serious health problems (diabetes complications). If your blood glucose levels get very high, you can develop diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA). It happens when your body doesn't have enough insulin to allow blood glucose into your cells for use as energy. Instead, your liver breaks down fat for fuel. This process produces acids called ketones. When too many ketones are produced too fast, they can build up to dangerous levels in your body. This can be life-threatening. The symptoms of DKA may include: Trouble breathing Nausea or vomiting Pain in your abdomen (belly) Confusion Feeling very tired or sleepy If you have an an at-home test for ketones, check your ketone level every 4 to 6 hours when your blood glucose is very high or when you are having these symptoms. If the test shows that your ketones are moderate or high, or if you don't have a ketones test, contact your health care provider right away or get emergency medical help. How is hyperglycemia diagnosed? If you have diabetes, you'll most likely need to check your blood glucose every day and make sure that it's not too high. You can do this with a blood glucose meter or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. There are also blood tests that providers can use to check if your blood glucose is too high. What are the treatments for hyperglycemia? If you have diabetes and often have high blood glucose, your health care team may make changes to your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, and/or diabetes medicines. If you have severe hyperglycemia and are having symptoms of DKA, you will need treatment at the hospital. The treatment often includes I.V. (intravenous) fluids and insulin. Can hyperglycemia be prevented? If you have diabetes, managing your diabetes can help prevent hyperglycemia. To manage your diabetes, it's important to: Follow your diabetes meal plan Get regular physical activity If you need diabetes medicines, take them correctly Regularly check your blood glucose level Get regular checkups with your health care team",MedlinePlus
Hyperthyroidism,https://medlineplus.gov/hyperthyroidism.html,"What is hyperthyroidism? Hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs. Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions. For example, they affect your breathing, heart rate, weight, digestion, and moods. If not treated, hyperthyroidism can cause serious problems with your heart, bones, muscles, menstrual cycle, and fertility. But there are treatments that can help. What causes hyperthyroidism? Hyperthyroidism has several causes. They include: Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder in which your immune system attacks your thyroid and causes it to make too much hormone. This is the most common cause. Thyroid nodules, which are growths on your thyroid. They are usually benign (not cancer). But they may become overactive and make too much thyroid hormone. Thyroid nodules are more common in older adults. Thyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid. It causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of your thyroid gland. Too much iodine. Iodine is found in some medicines, cough syrups, seaweed and seaweed-based supplements. Taking too much of them can cause your thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone. Too much thyroid medicine. This can happen if people who take thyroid hormone medicine for hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) take too much of it. Who is at risk for hyperthyroidism? You are at higher risk for hyperthyroidism if you: Are a woman Are older than age 60 Have been pregnant or had a baby within the past 6 months Have had thyroid surgery or a thyroid problem, such as goiter Have a family history of thyroid disease Have pernicious anemia , in which the body cannot make enough healthy red blood cells because it does not have enough vitamin B12 Have type 1 diabetes or primary adrenal insufficiency, a hormonal disorder Get too much iodine, from eating large amounts of foods containing iodine or using iodine-containing medicines or supplements What are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism? The symptoms of hyperthyroidism can vary from person to person and may include: Nervousness or irritability Fatigue Muscle weakness Trouble tolerating heat Trouble sleeping Tremor , usually in your hands Rapid and irregular heartbeat Frequent bowel movements or diarrhea Weight loss Mood swings Goiter, an enlarged thyroid that may cause your neck to look swollen. Sometimes it can cause trouble with breathing or swallowing. Adults over age 60 may have different symptoms than younger adults. For example, they may lose their appetite or withdraw from other people. Sometimes this can be mistaken for depression or dementia . What other problems can hyperthyroidism cause? If hyperthyroidism isn't treated, it can cause some serious health problems, including: An irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots , stroke , heart failure , and other heart problems An eye disease called Graves' ophthalmopathy. It can cause double vision, light sensitivity, and eye pain. In rare cases, it can lead to vision loss . Thinning bones and osteoporosis Fertility problems in women Complications in pregnancy, such as premature birth , low birth weight , high blood pressure in pregnancy , and miscarriage How is hyperthyroidism diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, including asking about symptoms A physical exam Thyroid tests , such as TSH , T3 , T4 , and thyroid antibody  blood tests Imaging tests , such as a thyroid scan, ultrasound , or radioactive iodine uptake test.  A radioactive iodine uptake test measures how much radioactive iodine your thyroid takes up from your blood after you swallow a small amount of it. What are the treatments for hyperthyroidism? The treatments for hyperthyroidism include medicines, radioiodine therapy, and thyroid surgery: Medicines for hyperthyroidism include Antithyroid medicines, which cause your thyroid to make less thyroid hormone. You probably need to take the medicines for 1 to 2 years. In some cases, you might need to take the medicines for several years. This is the simplest treatment, but it is often not a permanent cure. Beta blocker medicines, which can reduce symptoms such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. They work quickly and can help you feel better until other treatments take effect. Radioiodine therapy is a common and effective treatment for hyperthyroidism. It involves taking radioactive iodine by mouth as a capsule or liquid. This slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormone. It does not affect other body tissues. Almost everyone who has radioactive iodine treatment later develops hypothyroidism. This is because the thyroid hormone-producing cells have been destroyed. But hypothyroidism is easier to treat and causes fewer long-term health problems than hyperthyroidism. Surgery to remove part or most of the thyroid gland is done in rare cases. It might be an option for people with large goiters or pregnant women who cannot take antithyroid medicines. If you have all of your thyroid removed, you will need to take thyroid medicines for the rest of your life. Some people who have part of their thyroid removed also need to take medicines. If you have hyperthyroidism, it's important not to get too much iodine. Talk to your health care provider about which foods, supplements, and medicines you need to avoid.

Hypoglycemia means low glucose. It happens when the level of glucose in your blood drops below what is healthy for you: For many people with diabetes, this means a blood glucose level lower than 70 mg/dL. Your number might be different, so check with your health care team to find out what blood glucose level is too low for you. For people who don't have diabetes, hypoglycemia is typically a blood glucose level lower than 55 mg/dL. What causes hypoglycemia? Hypoglycemia is common in people who have diabetes type 1 or who have diabetes type 2 and take insulin or other diabetes medicines . It can happen: As a side effect of insulin or some other medicines that help your pancreas release insulin into your blood. These medicines can lower your blood glucose level. If you don't eat or drink enough carbohydrates (carbs). Carbs are the main source of glucose for your body. If you get a lot more physical activity than usual. If you drink too much alcohol without enough food. When you are sick and can't eat enough food or keep food down. Although it's rare, you can still get low blood glucose without having diabetes. The causes can include conditions such as liver disease , kidney disease , and hormone deficiencies (lack of certain hormones). It can also happen in people who have had certain types of weight loss surgery . Some medicines, such as certain heart medicines and antibiotics , can also cause it. See your health care provider to find out the cause of your low blood glucose and how to treat it. What are the symptoms of hypoglycemia? The symptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly. The symptoms can be different for everyone, but they may include: Shaking Sweating Nervousness or anxiety Irritability or confusion Dizziness Hunger How is hypoglycemia diagnosed? If you have diabetes, you'll most likely need to check your blood glucose every day and make sure that it's not too low.

If you don't have diabetes and you have hypoglycemia, your provider will likely order other tests to try to figure out the cause. What are the treatments for hypoglycemia? If you have mild or moderate hypoglycemia, eating or drinking something with carbohydrates can help. But severe hypoglycemia can cause serious complications, including passing out, coma, or even death. Severe hypoglycemia can be treated with glucagon, a hormone that raises blood glucose levels. It can be given as nasal spray or injection. If you have diabetes, your provider can prescribe you a glucagon kit for use in case of an emergency. If you have diabetes and you often have mild or moderate low blood glucose, your health care team may make changes to your diabetes meal plan , physical activity plan, and/or diabetes medicines. If you don't have diabetes and you keep having low blood glucose, the treatment will depend on what is causing it to happen. Can hypoglycemia be prevented? If you have diabetes and you take insulin or other medicines that lower blood glucose, you can help prevent hypoglycemia if you: Follow your diabetes meal plan. Eat and drink enough carbs to keep your blood glucose in your target range. Also carry a source of fast-acting carbohydrate, such as glucose tablets or a juice box, with you in case your blood glucose gets too low. Be safe during physical activity.

Immune System and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/immunesystemanddisorders.html,"What is the immune system? Your immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs. Together they help the body fight infections and other diseases. When germs such as bacteria or viruses invade your body, they attack and multiply. This is called an infection. The infection causes the disease that makes you sick. Your immune system protects you from the disease by fighting off the germs. What are the parts of the immune system? The immune system has many different parts, including: Your skin, which can help prevent germs from getting into the body Mucous membranes, which are the moist, inner linings of some organs and body cavities. They make mucus and other substances which can trap and fight germs. White blood cells, which fight germs Organs and tissues of the lymph system , such as the thymus, spleen , tonsils, lymph nodes, lymph vessels, and bone marrow .  They produce, store, and carry white blood cells. How does the immune system work? Your immune system defends your body against substances it sees as harmful or foreign. These substances are called antigens. They may be germs such as bacteria and viruses. They might be chemicals or toxins. They could also be cells that are damaged from things like cancer or sunburn . When your immune system recognizes an antigen, it attacks it. This is called an immune response. Part of this response is to make antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that work to attack, weaken, and destroy antigens. Your body also makes other cells to fight the antigen. Afterwards, your immune system remembers the antigen. If it sees the antigen again, it can recognize it. It will quickly send out the right antibodies, so in most cases, you don't get sick. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity. What are the types of immunity? There are three different types of immunity: Innate immunity is the protection that you are born with. It is your body's first line of defense. It includes barriers such as the skin and mucous membranes. They keep harmful substances from entering the body. It also includes some cells and chemicals which can attack foreign substances. Active immunity , also called adaptive immunity, develops when you are infected with or vaccinated against a foreign substance. Active immunity is usually long-lasting. For many diseases, it can last your entire life. Passive immunity happens when you receive antibodies to a disease instead of making them through your own immune system. For example, newborn babies have antibodies from their mothers. People can also get passive immunity through blood products that contain antibodies. This kind of immunity gives you protection right away. But it only lasts a few weeks or months. What can go wrong with the immune system? Sometimes a person may have an immune response even though there is no real threat. This can lead to problems such as allergies , asthma , and autoimmune diseases . If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Other immune system problems happen when your immune system does not work correctly. These problems include immunodeficiency diseases. If you have an immunodeficiency disease, you get sick more often. Your infections may last longer and can be more serious and harder to treat. They are often genetic disorders . There are other diseases that can affect your immune system. For example, HIV is a virus that harms your immune system by destroying your white blood cells. If HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). People with AIDS have badly damaged immune systems. They get an increasing number of severe illnesses.",MedlinePlus

The infection comes from a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection that spreads from another part of the body.  Symptoms of infectious arthritis include: Intense pain in the joint Joint redness and swelling Chills and fever Inability to move the area with the infected joint One type of infectious arthritis is reactive arthritis. The reaction is to an infection somewhere else in your body. The joint is usually the knee, ankle, or toe.  Sometimes, reactive arthritis is set off by an infection in the bladder, or in the urethra, which carries urine out of the body. In women, an infection in the vagina can cause the reaction. For both men and women, it can start with bacteria passed on during sex. Another form of reactive arthritis starts with eating food or handling something that has bacteria on it. To diagnose infectious arthritis, your health care provider may do tests of your blood, urine, and joint fluid. Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgery.",MedlinePlus
Infectious Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/infectiousdiseases.html,"What are infectious diseases? Germs, or microbes, are found everywhere - in the air, soil, and water.  There are also germs on your skin and in your body.  Many of them are harmless, and some can even be helpful. But some of them can make you sick. Infectious diseases are diseases that are caused by germs. What are the different types of germs that cause infectious diseases? There are four main types of germs: Bacteria are one-celled germs that multiply quickly. They may give off toxins, which are harmful chemicals that can make you sick. Strep throat and urinary tract infections are common bacterial infections. Viruses are tiny capsules that contain genetic material. They invade your cells so that they can multiply. This can kill, damage, or change the cells and make you sick. Viral infections include HIV and the common cold . Fungi are primitive plant-like organisms such as mushrooms, mold, mildew, and yeasts. Athlete's foot and yeast infections are common fungal infections. Parasites are animals or plants that survive by living on or in other living things. Malaria and head lice are infections that are caused by parasites. How can you get infectious diseases? There are many different ways that you can get an infectious disease, depending on the type of germ. They can include: Through direct contact with a person who is sick. This includes kissing, touching, sneezing, coughing, and sexual contact. If you are pregnant , you can pass some germs to your fetus. Through indirect contact, when you touch something that has germs on it. For example, you could get germs if someone who is sick touched a door handle, and then you touch it. Through insect or animal bites. Through contaminated food , water, soil, or plants. What are the symptoms of infectious diseases? Infectious diseases can cause many different symptoms. Some are so mild that you may not even notice any symptoms, while others can be life-threatening. What are the treatments for infectious diseases? There are treatments for some infectious diseases, such as antibiotic , antiviral, antifungal and anti-parasitic medicines. But for other infections, such as some caused by viruses, you can only treat your symptoms while you wait for your immune system to fight off the germ. Can infectious diseases be prevented? You can take steps to help prevent many infectious diseases: Get vaccinated . Wash your hands often . Pay attention to food safety . Avoid contact with wild animals. Use a latex condom every time you have sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. Don't share items such as toothbrushes, combs, and straws.",MedlinePlus
Infectious Mononucleosis,https://medlineplus.gov/infectiousmononucleosis.html,"What is infectious mononucleosis (mono)? Infectious mononucleosis (mono) is a disease caused by viruses .The most common cause is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Mono is contagious, which means it can spread from person to person. It is common among teenagers and young adults, especially college students. What causes infectious mononucleosis (mono)? Mono can be caused by many different viruses. But it is most often caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is found all over the world. Most people get an EBV infection at some point in their lives, but only some of them will get the symptoms of mono. EBV infections often happen during childhood or when someone is a young adult. EBV infections in children usually do not cause symptoms. And when they do, it's hard to tell the difference between the symptoms of mono and the symptoms of other common childhood illnesses such as the flu . Teens and young adults who get EBV are more likely to have symptoms that are typical of mono. EBV and the other viruses that cause mono are usually spread through body fluids, especially saliva (spit). This means that you can get it through kissing. That's why mono is sometimes called ""the kissing disease."" But you can also get these viruses if you share food, drinks, forks, spoons, or lip balm with someone who has mono. Other less common ways of getting an infection are through blood transfusions , organ transplants , and blood and semen during sexual contact. What are the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis (mono)? The symptoms of mono usually start four to six weeks after you get the infection. But they may start sooner in young children. The symptoms often develop slowly, and they may not all happen at the same time. They can include: Extreme fatigue Fever Sore throat Head and body aches Swollen lymph glands in your neck and armpits Rash Swollen liver, spleen, or both (these are less common symptoms) Most people get better in two to four weeks. However, some people may feel fatigued for several more weeks. Occasionally, the symptoms can last for six months or longer. How is infectious mononucleosis (mono) diagnosed? Your healthcare provider may diagnose mono based on your symptoms and a physical exam. The exam will include checking to see if your lymph nodes, tonsils, liver, or spleen are swollen. In some cases, your provider might also order a mono test to confirm the diagnosis. What are the treatments for infectious mononucleosis (mono)? Drinking plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration . Getting lots of rest. Taking over-the-counter medications for pain and fever. But don't give aspirin to children or teens because it may cause Reye syndrome . This syndrome is a rare, serious illness that can affect the brain and liver. If you have severe symptoms, your provider may suggest additional treatment based on which organs in your body are affected by the mono. Antibiotics don't treat viral infections, so they do not help with mono. Some people do get bacterial infections such as strep throat along with mono. In that case, you probably need antibiotics to treat the bacterial infection. But you should not take penicillin antibiotics like ampicillin or amoxicillin. Those antibiotics can cause a rash in people who have mono. Mono can cause an enlarged spleen, which could rupture and cause a medical emergency. To try to protect the spleen, providers recommend avoiding intense exercise and contact sports until you fully recover (about a month). Can infectious mononucleosis (mono) be prevented? There is no vaccine to protect against mono. To lower your chance of getting or spreading mono: Don't share food, drinks, forks, spoons, or lip balm with anyone, especially if you or the other person has mono. Don't kiss someone if you or the other person has mono. Wash your hands often with soap and water. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus

Iron,https://medlineplus.gov/iron.html,"What is iron? Iron is a mineral that our bodies need for growth and development. Your body uses iron to make hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. Hemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. Iron is also important for healthy muscles, bone marrow, and organ function. Your body also needs iron to make some hormones . How do you get iron? Iron is found naturally in many foods and is added to some fortified food products. Foods that are high in iron include: Lean meat, seafood, and poultry Iron-fortified breakfast cereals and breads White beans, lentils, spinach, kidney beans, and peas Nuts and some dried fruits, such as raisins Iron is available in supplements, either on its own or as part of many multivitamin/mineral supplements.

Another cause is stenosis, or narrowing of the artery. This can happen because of atherosclerosis , a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted briefly. Having a TIA can mean you are at risk for having a more serious stroke. Symptoms of stroke are: Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body) Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination Sudden severe headache with no known cause It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible.

Jaundice,https://medlineplus.gov/jaundice.html,"Jaundice causes your skin and the whites of your eyes to turn yellow. Too much bilirubin causes jaundice.  Bilirubin is a yellow chemical in hemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen in your red blood cells. As red blood cells break down, your body builds new cells to replace them. The old ones are processed by the liver. If the liver cannot handle the blood cells as they break down, bilirubin builds up in the body and your skin may look yellow. Many healthy babies have some jaundice during the first week of life.  It usually goes away.   However, jaundice can happen at any age and may be a sign of a problem.

Jaw Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/jawinjuriesanddisorders.html,"Your jaw is a set of bones that holds your teeth. It includes: The maxilla, which is the upper part of your jaw. It holds your top teeth in place and doesn't move. It also supports the muscles involved in chewing and facial expressions. The mandible, which is the lower part of your jaw. You move it when you talk or chew. It also holds your lower teeth in place. The temporomandibular joints (TMJs), which are two joints (one on each side) that connect your mandible to your skull. Jaw problems can include: Fractures (broken bones). Dislocations , which are joint injuries that force the ends of your bones out of position. Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), which are conditions that affect your TMJs. Osteonecrosis , which happens when the blood flow to part of your bone is disrupted. It can cause the bone to break down. Jaw tumors, which can be benign (not cancer) or cancer. Jaw defects, which are birth defects in which your jaw could be missing or deformed.

Joint Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/jointdisorders.html,"What are joints? Your joints are places where two or more bones come together. Your shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and knuckles are all joints. Your spine has joints, too. But joints are more than bones. They include the soft tissues around them, such as cartilage, tendons and ligaments. Cartilage is the hard slippery flexible tissue that covers the ends of your bones at a joint. Tendons are tough, flexible bands that connect your muscles to your bones so you can move your joints. Ligaments connect the bones of the joint to each other to keep them stable when you move. What are joint disorders? Joint disorders are diseases or injuries that affect your joints. Injuries can happen because of overuse of a joint. Or you could have a sudden injury, such as an accident or a sports injury . What diseases can affect the joints? Many diseases can affect the joints. They often cause joint pain and make your joints stiff, red, or swollen. Most of them are chronic. That means they last a long time. Some may never go away completely. Some of the diseases that affect the joints include: Arthritis . Arthritis may cause joint pain and swelling. There are many types of this disease. Osteoarthritis is the most common type. Over time, arthritis can cause severe joint damage. It can affect people of all ages. A joint injury when you're young may cause osteoarthritis later in life. Lupus . This autoimmune disease affects many parts of the body and can cause joint and muscle pain. Some types of lupus often cause arthritis. Sjögren's Syndrome . This autoimmune disease affects glands that make moisture in many parts of the body. The main symptoms are dry eyes and mouth, but it often causes joint pain, too. Treatments are different depending on the disease. But most treatments include medicines and therapies to relieve pain and other symptoms. What types of joint disorders happen from sudden injuries? Joint disorders from sudden injuries include: Sprains and strains . Sprains are stretched or torn ligaments. Acute strains are stretched or torn muscles or tendons that happen from a sudden injury or movement, such as lifting a heavy object. Dislocated joints . A joint is dislocated when the bones are pushed or pulled out of position. A joint dislocation is a medical emergency. Treatment depends on the type of injury. You can treat many sports injuries at home. But you should call your health care provider if you: Have a lot of joint pain, swelling or numbness Can't put weight on the joint Have pain from an old injury with more swelling, an unstable joint, or a joint that isn't normal in another way What types of joint disorders happen from overuse? Overuse injuries usually damage the soft tissues of the joint. They can happen when you work a joint too hard by doing the same movements over and over. For example, you could get an overuse injury from playing a musical instrument, playing sports, or doing certain jobs, such as carpentry or painting. Joint overuse injuries include: Bursitis . The bursa is a small fluid-filled sac. It works as a pad between the bones of a joint and the moving parts around it, such as muscles, tendons and skin. With bursitis, the bursa becomes irritated and swollen with extra fluid. Overuse is the most common cause, but injuries, infections and other conditions, such as arthritis, can cause bursitis. Tendinitis . This condition happens when you overuse a tendon. It swells and makes the joint painful to move. Chronic strain. A strain becomes chronic when your muscles or tendons stretch or tear slowly over time from repeating the same movements. The treatments for bursitis, tendinitis, and chronic strain are often the same. They usually include rest, keeping the injured joint higher than your heart, and taking medicine to reduce swelling. Your provider may recommend gentle exercise and other treatment. In some cases, your provider may suggest an injection (a shot) of medicine into the joint. If these do not help, you may need surgery. How can I keep my joints healthy? Getting enough physical activity is one of the most important things you can do to prevent or slow joint disorders. Activity strengthens the muscles around your joints and helps them work better. When you play sports, wear the right equipment to protect your joints, such as knee pads. If you already have joint problems, ask your provider what type of activities are best for you. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases",MedlinePlus
Juvenile Arthritis,https://medlineplus.gov/juvenilearthritis.html,"What is juvenile arthritis? Juvenile arthritis (JA) is arthritis that happens in children. It causes joint inflammation (swelling), pain, stiffness, and loss of motion. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. It can affect any joint, but it is more common in the knees, hands, and feet. JA can affect your child's growth and development, and in some cases, it can also affect other organs. Finding JA early and starting treatment can help manage symptoms and reduce joint damage. Who is more likely to get juvenile arthritis? There are several other forms of arthritis affecting children. The most common type of JA in children under age 16 is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). There are multiple types of JIA. Symptoms and the number of joints affected help determine the type. Some types of JIA are more common in girls. What causes juvenile arthritis? The exact cause of JA is unknown. Most types are autoimmune disorders . This means that your immune system, which normally helps your body fight infection, attacks your body's tissues. What are the symptoms of juvenile arthritis? Symptoms can vary depending on the type of JA. The symptoms of most types include joint pain, swelling, warmth, and stiffness. Your child may not complain of pain or stiffness, but one early sign of JA may be limping or clumsiness in the morning or after resting. Larger joints, such as the knee, may be swollen. Certain types of JA can cause a high fever , swollen lymph nodes, a rash, growth problems, or eye inflammation in some children. Symptoms can come and go. Some children have just one or two flare-ups. Others have symptoms that never go away. How is juvenile arthritis diagnosed? There is no single test for JA, so it can be hard to diagnose. Your health care provider may: Ask about medical history and symptoms. Do a physical exam. Order blood tests or imaging studies . What are the treatments for juvenile arthritis? A team of providers usually treats JA. Treatment will depend on your child's age, the type of JA, and how bad it is. Treatment can include medicines and physical therapy to help maintain movement and reduce swelling and pain. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases",MedlinePlus
Kaposi Sarcoma,https://medlineplus.gov/kaposisarcoma.html,"What is Kaposi sarcoma? Kaposi sarcoma, sometimes called KS, is a type of cancer. It causes lesions (abnormal tissue) to grow in different parts of the body, including: The skin Lymph nodes Mucous membranes (the lining of the mouth, nose, and throat) Other organs These lesions are usually red or purple. They are made of cancer cells, new blood vessels, and blood cells. The lesions may begin in more than one place in the body at the same time. This makes Kaposi sarcoma different from other cancers. What causes Kaposi sarcoma and who is more likely to develop it? Kaposi sarcoma is caused by infection with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). This virus is also called Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Most people infected with this virus don't get Kaposi sarcoma. But certain people who get this virus are more likely to develop one of the types of Kaposi sarcoma: People with weakened immune systems due to HIV can develop epidemic (HIV-associated) Kaposi sarcoma. People with weakened immune systems due to medicines they need to take after an organ transplant can develop iatrogenic (transplant-related) Kaposi sarcoma. Older men of Mediterranean or Eastern European Jewish heritage can develop classic Kaposi sarcoma. Young men in Africa can develop endemic (African) Kaposi sarcoma. What are the symptoms of Kaposi sarcoma? Kaposi sarcoma usually starts out as one or more red, purple, or brown skin lesions on the legs and feet. They are most often on the ankles or soles of the feet. Over time, lesions may form in other parts of the body. The lesions may not cause symptoms. But sometimes the lesions can cause problems, especially as you get more of them and they grow bigger. For example: Pressure from the lesions may block the flow of lymph and blood in the legs and cause painful swelling If lesions grow in your stomach or intestines, they can bleed and may cause abdominal (belly) pain and diarrhea Lesions in the lungs can also bleed and may cause shortness of breath How is Kaposi sarcoma diagnosed? To find out whether you have Kaposi sarcoma, your health care provider: Will ask about your medical and family history Will do a physical exam May order a chest x-ray to look for Kaposi sarcoma in the lungs May do a biopsy to check for Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the skin May do an endoscopy to check for Kaposi sarcoma in the stomach and intestines May do a bronchoscopy to check for Kaposi sarcoma in the lungs If you do have Kaposi sarcoma, you will likely need blood and imaging tests to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. What are the treatments for Kaposi sarcoma? Which treatment(s) you get will depend on The type of Kaposi sarcoma you have How many lesions you have and where in the body they are What kinds of problems the lesions are causing Your overall health For people who have epidemic (HIV-associated) Kaposi sarcoma, taking HIV medicines may be enough to treat the Kaposi sarcoma. For people who have iatrogenic (transplant-related) Kaposi sarcoma, changing the dose of the medicines or switching medicines may be helpful. But some people with these types of Kaposi sarcoma will need additional treatment. The treatment options for Kaposi sarcoma may include: Radiation therapy Surgery Cryosurgery, a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue Chemotherapy Immunotherapy NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus
Kawasaki Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/kawasakidisease.html,"What is Kawasaki disease? Kawasaki disease is a rare illness that usually affects small children. Other names for the disease are Kawasaki syndrome and mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. It is a type of vasculitis , which is inflammation of the blood vessels. Kawasaki disease is serious, but most children can fully recover if they are treated right away. What causes Kawasaki disease? Kawasaki disease happens when the immune system injures the blood vessels by mistake. Researchers do not fully know why this happens. But when it does, the blood vessels become inflamed and can narrow or close off. Genetics may play a role in Kawasaki disease. There may also be environmental factors, such as infections. It does not seem to be contagious. This means that it cannot be passed from one child to another. Who is more likely to develop Kawasaki disease? Kawasaki disease usually affects children under the age of 5. But older children and adults can sometimes get it. It is more common in boys than girls. It can affect children of any race, but those with Asian or Pacific Islander descent are more likely to get it. What are the symptoms of Kawasaki disease? The symptoms of Kawasaki disease may include: High fever lasting at least five days A rash , often on the back, chest, and groin Swollen hands and feet Redness of the lips, lining of the mouth, tongue, palms of the hand, and soles of the feet Pink eye (conjunctivitis) Swollen lymph nodes in the neck Contact your child's health care provider if your child has a fever for 4 days, especially if they have any other symptoms of Kawasaki disease. What other problems can Kawasaki disease cause? Sometimes Kawasaki disease can affect the walls of the coronary arteries. These arteries bring blood and oxygen to your heart. This can lead to: An aneurysm (bulging and thinning of the walls of the arteries). This can raise the risk of blood clots in the arteries. If the blood clots are not treated, they could lead to a heart attack or internal bleeding. Inflammation in the heart. Heart valve problems . Kawasaki disease can also affect other parts of the body, including the brain and nervous system, the immune system, and the digestive system. How is Kawasaki disease diagnosed? There is no specific test for Kawasaki disease. To find out if your child has Kawasaki disease, your child's provider: Will do a physical exam, which includes looking at the signs and symptoms Will likely order blood and urine tests to rule out other diseases and check for signs of inflammation May order tests to check for damage to the heart, such as an echocardiogram and electrocardiogram (EKG) What are the treatments for Kawasaki disease? Kawasaki disease is usually treated in the hospital with an intravenous (IV) dose of immunoglobulin (IVIG) antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight infections. Aspirin may also be part of the treatment. But do not give your child aspirin unless the health care provider tells you to. Aspirin can cause Reye syndrome in children. This is a rare, serious illness that can affect the brain and liver. Treatment usually works. But if it is not working well enough, the provider may also give your child other medicines to fight the inflammation. If the disease affects your child's heart, they might need additional medicines, surgery, or other medical procedures.",MedlinePlus

Klinefelter Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/klinefeltersyndrome.html,"What is Klinefelter syndrome (KS)? Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a genetic condition that happens when a male is born with an extra copy of the X chromosome. KS can affect different stages of physical, language, and social development. It also usually causes infertility . What causes Klinefelter syndrome (KS)? KS is not inherited. It's caused by a random error that happens when a sperm or egg is formed. This error causes a male to be born with an extra X chromosome. Chromosomes are tiny ""packages"" in your cells that contain your genes. Genes carry information, called DNA, that controls what you look like and how your body works. Normally, you're born with a set of 46 chromosomes in each cell, two of which are the sex chromosomes. Females usually have two X chromosomes (XX), and males usually have one X and one Y (XY). In KS, the male usually has two X chromosomes and one Y (XXY). In rare cases, a male could have XY in some cells and XXY in other cells. This is called mosaic Klinefelter syndrome. Males with mosaic Klinefelter syndrome may have fewer symptoms, depending on the number of XY cells they have in their bodies and where those cells are located. What are the symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome (KS)? Some males with KS may have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. So they might not know that they have KS, or they might not get diagnosed with it right away. In other cases, the symptoms can be more severe. Boys with KS may be taller than other boys their age, with more fat around the belly. After puberty, they may have: Smaller testes and penis Breast growth (called gynecomastia) Less facial and body hair Reduced muscle tone Narrower shoulders and wider hips Weaker bones Decreased sexual interest Lower energy Many of these symptoms happen because of low testosterone in the body. Testosterone is the main male sex hormone . Boys with KS may also have learning or language problems. These problems may affect them socially, so they may be shy and quiet and can have trouble fitting in. Most males with KS are infertile because they make little or no sperm. How is Klinefelter syndrome (KS) diagnosed? A genetic test called a karyotype test can diagnose KS. This test can show if there are abnormal chromosomes, including if there is an extra X chromosome. What are the treatments for Klinefelter syndrome (KS)? There is no cure for KS, but treatments are available. The sooner the treatment is started, the better.  If treatment is started by early puberty, it will likely help in reducing the symptoms. Treatments for KS may include: Testosterone replacement therapy Surgery to remove or reduce breasts Physical, speech, behavioral, and occupational therapy In some cases, fertility treatments may help men with KS father children.

Knee Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/kneeinjuriesanddisorders.html,"Your knee joint is made up of bone, cartilage, ligaments and fluid. Muscles and tendons help the knee joint move. When any of these structures is hurt or diseased, you have knee problems. Knee problems can cause pain and difficulty walking. Knee problems are very common, and they occur in people of all ages. Knee problems can interfere with many things, from participation in sports to simply getting up from a chair and walking. This can have a big impact on your life. The most common disease affecting the knee is osteoarthritis . The cartilage in the knee gradually wears away, causing pain and swelling. Injuries to ligaments and tendons also cause knee problems. A common injury is to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). You usually injure your ACL by a sudden twisting motion. ACL and other knee injuries are common sports injuries .

Knee Replacement,https://medlineplus.gov/kneereplacement.html,"What is knee replacement surgery? Knee replacement surgery is a surgery to replace parts of your knee joint with new, artificial parts. You may need a knee replacement if you have knee damage that causes severe pain and difficulty doing daily activities, such as walking and climbing stairs. It is usually done when other treatments for knee pain haven't helped enough. The goal of a knee replacement is to relieve pain and help you move better. People of all ages may have knee replacement surgery. But it is more common in older people. The decision whether to have surgery is based on your overall health and how much your knee bothers you. What conditions does knee replacement surgery treat? Knee replacement surgery treats conditions that cause the cartilage of the knee joint to wear away. These include: Knee osteoarthritis . This is the most common reason for knee replacement surgery. It usually develops over time after an injury or with aging. Knee damage from other types of arthritis . Problems from knee joints that aren't formed correctly . What happens during knee replacement surgery? During the surgery, a surgeon removes damaged cartilage and some bone from the surfaces of your knee joint. Cartilage is tissue that covers your bones where they meet. Healthy cartilage is smooth and helps the bones glide over each other when you move. When cartilage becomes rough and wears away, the bones rub against each other, causing pain. After removing the damaged knee cartilage and bone, the surgeon attaches the artificial parts to your bones. The artificial parts are made of metal and plastic. They will give your knee new, smooth surfaces. Knee replacement surgery may replace all the damaged parts of your knee (total knee replacement) or just part of your knee (partial knee replacement). In a total knee replacement, the surgeon replaces 3 surfaces: The end of the shinbone The end of the thighbone The back of the kneecap What happens after knee replacement surgery? Some people go home the same day they have surgery. Other people will stay in the hospital a few days. To help prevent blood clots , you'll most likely take blood thinners and wear special socks or coverings on your legs for a short time after surgery. The success of your surgery depends a lot on what you do at home to help yourself recover. A physical therapist will teach you exercises to make your knee stronger and help it bend. It is important to do these exercises regularly. You may need to use a cane or walker for several weeks after the surgery. It will probably also be several weeks before you can drive. Your doctor will tell you when you can start driving again. Most people who follow their recovery instructions can get back to nearly all of their normal daily activities within 3 to 6 weeks after surgery. What is life like after a knee replacement? After recovering from surgery, most people can move better with less pain than before surgery. But having an artificial knee is not the same as having a normal, healthy knee. You need to protect your new knee by: Staying at a healthy weight . Getting regular physical activity . Not doing any high-impact activities, such as jogging, running, and jumping. Instead, you can try low-impact activities that are good for your knee, such as walking, biking, and swimming What are the risks of knee replacement surgery? The chance of having problems after knee replacement surgery is low. But there are risks after any surgery. Possible problems after knee replacement surgery include: Infection Blood clots Heart attack Stroke Nerve damage Scarring that limits how far you can bend your knee Your age, general health, and how active you are can all affect your risk of having a problem after knee replacement surgery. How long does a knee replacement last? A knee replacement doesn't last forever. After 15 to 20 years, the artificial knee parts may become loose or worn. If that happens, you may need another surgery on the same knee. If you're thinking about having knee replacement surgery, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits.

LDL and HDL have different purposes: LDL stands for low-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the ""bad"" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. HDL stands for high-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the ""good"" cholesterol because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body. How can a high LDL level raise my risk of coronary artery disease and other diseases? If you have a high LDL level, this means that you have too much LDL cholesterol in your blood. This extra LDL, along with other substances, forms plaque. The plaque builds up in your arteries; this is a condition called atherosclerosis . Coronary artery disease happens when the plaque buildup is in the arteries of your heart. It causes the arteries to become hardened and narrowed, which slows down or blocks the blood flow to your heart. Because your blood carries oxygen to your heart, this means that your heart may not be able to get enough oxygen. This can cause angina (chest pain), or if the blood flow is completely blocked, a heart attack . How do I know what my LDL level is? A blood test can measure your cholesterol levels, including LDL. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are: For people who are age 19 or younger: : The first test should be between ages 9 to 11 Children should have the test again every 5 years Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke For people who are age 20 or older: : Younger adults should have the test every 5 years Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years For people who are older than 65: They should have the test every year. You may need to get your cholesterol checked more often if you have heart disease , diabetes , or a family history of high cholesterol. What can affect my LDL level? Things that can affect your LDL level include: Diet. Saturated fat and cholesterol in the food you eat make your LDL level rise Weight. Being overweight tends to raise your LDL level, lower your HDL level, and increase your total cholesterol level Physical Activity. A lack of physical activity can lead to weight gain, which can raise your LDL level Smoking. Cigarette smoking lowers your HDL cholesterol. Since HDL helps to remove LDL from your arteries, if you have less HDL, that can contribute to you having a higher LDL level. Age and Sex. As women and men get older, their cholesterol levels rise. Before the age of menopause, women have lower total cholesterol levels than men of the same age. After the age of menopause, women's LDL levels tend to rise. Genetics. Your genes partly determine how much cholesterol your body makes. High cholesterol can run in families. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited form of high blood cholesterol. Medicines. Certain medicines, including steroids , some blood pressure medicines , and HIV medicines , can raise your LDL level. Other medical conditions. Diseases such as chronic kidney disease , diabetes, and HIV can cause a higher LDL level. Race or ethnicity. People from certain racial or ethnic groups may have an increased risk of high blood cholesterol. For example, African Americans typically have higher HDL and LDL cholesterol levels than White Americans. Asian Americans are more likely to have higher LDL levels than other groups. What should my LDL level be? With LDL cholesterol, lower numbers are better, because a high LDL level can raise your risk for coronary artery disease and related problems. The general ranges for healthy adults are: LDL (Bad) Cholesterol Level LDL Cholesterol Category Less than 100 mg/dL Optimal 100-129 mg/dL Near optimal/above optimal 130-159 mg/dL Borderline high 160-189 mg/dL High 190 mg/dL and above Very High If you have coronary artery disease or are at high risk for it, your health care provider may have different goals for your LDL level. How can I lower my LDL level? There are two main ways to lower your LDL cholesterol level: Heart-healthy lifestyle changes, which include: Heart-healthy eating. A heart-healthy eating plan limits the amount of saturated and trans fats that you eat. Examples of eating plans that can lower your LDL level include the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet and the DASH eating plan . Weight management . If you are overweight, losing weight can help lower your LDL level. Physical Activity. Everyone should get regular physical activity . Drug Treatment. If lifestyle changes alone do not lower your LDL level enough, you may also need to take medicines. There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including statins . The medicines work in different ways and can have different side effects. Talk to your provider about which one is right for you.  While you are taking medicines to lower your LDL level, you still should continue with the lifestyle changes. Some people with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) may receive a treatment called lipoprotein apheresis. This treatment uses a filtering machine to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood. Then the machine returns the rest of the blood back to the person. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Lead Poisoning,https://medlineplus.gov/leadpoisoning.html,"Lead is a metal that occurs naturally in the earth's crust.  Lead can be found in all parts of our environment. Much of it comes from human activities such as mining and manufacturing. Lead used to be in paint; older houses may still have lead paint. You could be exposed to lead by: Eating food or drinking water that contains lead. Water pipes in older homes may contain lead. Working in a job where lead is used Using lead in a hobby, such as making stained glass or lead-glazed pottery Using folk remedies such as herbs or foods that contain lead Breathing air, drinking water, eating food, or swallowing or touching dirt that contains lead can cause many health problems. Lead can affect almost every organ and system in your body. In adults, lead can increase blood pressure and cause infertility, nerve disorders, and muscle and joint pain. It can also make you irritable and affect your ability to concentrate and remember. Lead is especially dangerous for children. A child who swallows large amounts of lead may develop anemia, severe stomachache, muscle weakness, and brain damage. Even at low levels, lead can affect a child's mental and physical growth.

Learning Disabilities,https://medlineplus.gov/learningdisabilities.html,"What is a learning disability? Learning disabilities are conditions that affect the ability to learn. They can cause problems with: Understanding what people are saying Speaking Reading Writing Doing math Paying attention Often, children have more than one kind of learning disability. They may also have another condition, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  This can make learning even more of a challenge. The sooner a learning disability is identified and addressed, the better a child is likely to perform in school. What causes learning disabilities? Learning disabilities don't have anything to do with how smart your child is. They are caused by differences in the brain, and they affect the way the brain takes in and uses information. These differences are usually present at birth. But there are certain factors that can play a role in the development of a learning disability, including: Genetics Environmental exposures, such as lead Using substances while pregnant How are learning disabilities diagnosed? The earlier you can find and treat a learning disability, the better. Unfortunately, learning disabilities are usually not found until a child is in school. If you notice that your child is struggling, talk to your child's teacher or health care provider about having your child evaluated for a learning disability. The evaluation may include: Doing a physical exam to check for a medical problem that might make learning more difficult. Asking about your family history. Test your child's intellectual and school performance. What are the treatments for learning disabilities? The most common treatment for learning disabilities is special education. A teacher or other learning specialist can help your child learn skills by building on their strengths and finding ways to make up for their weaknesses. They may suggest ways you can help your child when they do homework. Instructors may try special teaching methods, make changes to the classroom, or use technologies that can assist your child's learning needs. Some children also get help from tutors or speech or language therapists. A child with a learning disability may struggle with low self-esteem, frustration, and other problems. Mental health professionals can help your child understand these feelings, develop coping tools, and build healthy relationships. If your child has another condition, such as ADHD, they will need treatment for that condition as well. NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development",MedlinePlus
Leg Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/leginjuriesanddisorders.html,"Your legs are made up of bones, blood vessels, muscles, and other connective tissue.

Legionnaires' Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/legionnairesdisease.html,"What is Legionnaires' Disease? Legionnaires' disease is a serious type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria . The disease got its name when a group of people at an American Legion convention became ill with this type of pneumonia. Legionella is found naturally in freshwater, such as lakes and rivers. It can also be found in soil. But people usually only get sick from it when if it grows and spreads in man-made water systems. These systems can include hot tubs, fountains, and the plumbing systems of large buildings, such as hotels or nursing homes. Legionella can also cause Pontiac fever. This is a milder, flu-like illness that doesn't infect your lungs. What causes Legionnaires' disease? You can get the infection by breathing in mist or small drops of water that contain the bacteria. The mist may come from hot tubs, showers, or large building air conditioning units. You usually can't get infected by drinking water that contains the bacteria unless you aspirate it (accidentally breathe the water into your lungs). The bacteria don't spread from person to person. Disease outbreaks happen when many people are exposed to the same water source that contains the bacteria. Who is more likely to develop Legionnaires' disease? Most healthy people who come in contact with the bacteria do not become sick. You are more likely to develop an infection if you: Are over the age of 50 Are a current or former smoker Have a chronic (long-lasting) disease such as diabetes or kidney failure Have a chronic lung disease such as COPD or emphysema Have a weakened immune system due to a disease such as HIV or cancer or are taking medicines that suppress your immune system Live in a long-term care facility Have recently stayed in a hospital or had surgery requiring anesthesia What are the symptoms of Legionnaires' disease? The symptoms usually show up 2 to 14 days after you were exposed to Legionella bacteria. Most of the symptoms are similar to those of other types of pneumonia. But Legionnaires' disease may also cause gastrointestinal symptoms and mental changes. The symptoms of Legionnaires' disease may include: Cough High fever Chills Headache Chest pain Shortness of breath Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Confusion What other problems can Legionnaires' disease cause? Legionnaires' disease can cause life-threatening complications such as respiratory failure , kidney failure, and sepsis . About 1 out of every 10 people who get sick with Legionnaires' disease will die from complications of the illness. How is Legionnaires' disease diagnosed? To find out if you have Legionnaires' disease, your health care provider will probably order a chest x-ray to see if you have pneumonia. If you do have it, lab tests such as a urine or sputum test can check for the Legionella bacteria. Your provider may also order a blood test to see if you have been exposed to the bacteria. What are the treatments for Legionnaires' disease? If you have Legionnaires' disease, you will likely need care in a hospital. The treatment is with antibiotics . Most people will recover, especially if they were healthy when they got the disease. Getting treatment early can increase the chances of getting better. Can Legionnaires' disease be prevented? You can lower your risk of getting Legionnaires' disease if you: Clean all your water-related devices regularly. This could include portable humidifiers, water heaters, air conditioners, and nasal rinses. If you haven't used your faucets and showerheads for a week or more, flush them by letting the hot and cold faucets run for at least two minutes before use. Avoid exposure to water sources such as decorative foundations or hot tubs if you don't know how well they are maintained. Use windshield cleaner in your wiper fluid tank in your car instead of water. Ask about how well your buildings' water systems are maintained. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus
Leishmaniasis,https://medlineplus.gov/leishmaniasis.html,"Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease spread by the bite of infected sand flies. There are several different forms of leishmaniasis. The most common are cutaneous and visceral.  The cutaneous type causes skin sores. The visceral type affects internal organs such as the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. People with this form usually have fever, weight loss, and an enlarged spleen and liver. Leishmaniasis is found in parts of about 88 countries. Most of these countries are in the tropics and subtropics. It is possible but very unlikely that you would get this disease in the United States. But you should be aware of it if you are traveling to the Middle East or parts of Central America, South America, Asia, Africa or southern Europe. Treatment is with medicines that contain antimony, a type of metal, or with strong antibiotics.

Leukemia,https://medlineplus.gov/leukemia.html,"What is leukemia? Leukemia is a term for cancers of the blood cells. Leukemia starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job: White blood cells help your body fight infection Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs Platelets help form clots to stop bleeding When you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work. What are the types of leukemia? There are different types of leukemia. Which type of leukemia you have depends on the type of blood cell that becomes cancer and whether it grows quickly or slowly. The type of blood cell could be: Lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell Myeloid cells, immature cells that become white blood cells, red blood cells, or platelets The different types can grow quickly or slowly: Acute leukemia is fast growing. It usually gets worse quickly if it's not treated. Chronic leukemia is slow growing. It usually gets worse over a longer period of time. The main types of leukemia are: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) , which is the most common type of cancer in children. It can also affect adults. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) , which is more common in older adults but can also affect children Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) , which is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults. It often occurs during or after middle age. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) , which usually occurs in adults during or after middle age What causes leukemia? Leukemia happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown. Who is at risk for leukemia? For the specific types, there are different factors which can raise your risk of getting that type. Overall, your risk of leukemia goes up as you age. It is most common over age 60. What are the symptoms of leukemia? Some of the symptoms of leukemia may include: Feeling tired Fever or night sweats Easy bruising or bleeding Weight loss or loss of appetite Petechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding. Other leukemia symptoms can be different from type to type. Chromic leukemia may not cause symptoms at first. How is leukemia diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose leukemia: A physical exam A medical history Blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) Bone marrow tests . There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing. Genetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes Once the provider makes a diagnosis, there may be additional tests to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and a lumbar puncture, which is a procedure to collect and test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). What are the treatments for leukemia? The treatments for leukemia depend on which type you have, how severe the leukemia is, your age, your overall health, and other factors. Some possible treatments might include: Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus
Leukodystrophies,https://medlineplus.gov/leukodystrophies.html,"What are leukodystrophies? Leukodystrophies are a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is made up of your brain and spinal cord.  Leukodystrophies damage the white matter of your CNS. The white matter includes: Nerve fibers, also called axons, which connect your nerve cells Myelin, a layer of proteins and fatty materials that covers and protects the nerve fibers. It also helps speed up signals between the nerve cells. When the white matter is damaged, it can slow down or block the signals between nerve cells. This can cause many different symptoms, including trouble with movement , vision , hearing , and thinking. There are over 50 types of leukodystrophies. Some types are present at birth, while others may not cause symptoms until a child becomes a toddler. A few types mainly affect adults. Most types get worse over time. What causes leukodystrophies? Leukodystrophies are caused by genetic changes. These changes are usually inherited, meaning that they are passed from parent to child. What are the symptoms of leukodystrophies? The symptoms of leukodystrophies depend on the type; they can include a gradual loss of: Muscle tone Balance and mobility Walking Speech Ability to eat Vision Hearing Behavior There can also be other symptoms, such as: Learning disabilities Bladder issues Breathing problems Developmental disabilities Muscle control disorders Seizures How are leukodystrophies diagnosed? Leukodystrophies can be hard to diagnose because there are so many different types which can have different symptoms.

Lewy Body Dementia,https://medlineplus.gov/lewybodydementia.html,"What is Lewy body dementia (LBD)? Lewy body dementia (LBD) is one of the most common types of dementia in older adults. Dementia is a loss of mental functions that is severe enough to affect your daily life and activities. These functions include: Memory Language skills Visual perception (your ability to make sense of what you see) Problem solving Trouble with everyday tasks The ability to focus and pay attention What are the types of Lewy body dementia (LBD)? There are two types of LBD: dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia. Both types cause the same changes in the brain. And, over time, they can cause similar symptoms. The main difference is in when the cognitive (thinking) and movement symptoms start. Dementia with Lewy bodies causes problems with thinking ability that seem similar to Alzheimer's disease . Later, it also causes other symptoms, such as movement symptoms, visual hallucinations, and certain sleep disorders . It also causes more trouble with mental activities than with memory. Parkinson's disease dementia starts as a movement disorder. It first causes the symptoms of Parkinson's disease : slowed movement, muscle stiffness, tremor, and a shuffling walk. Later on, it causes dementia. What causes Lewy body dementia (LBD)? LBD happens when Lewy bodies build up in parts of the brain that control memory, thinking, and movement.  Lewy bodies are abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein. Researchers don't know exactly why these deposits form. But they do know that other diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, also involve a build-up of that protein. Who is at risk for Lewy body dementia (LBD)? The biggest risk factor for LBD is age; most people who get it are over age 50. People who have a family history of LBD are also at higher risk. What are the symptoms of Lewy body dementia (LBD)? LBD is a progressive disease. This means that the symptoms start slowly and get worse over time. The most common symptoms include changes in cognition, movement, sleep, and behavior: Dementia , which is a loss of mental functions that is severe enough to affect your daily life and activities Changes in concentration, attention, alertness, and wakefulness. These changes usually happen from day to day. But sometimes they can also happen throughout the same day. Visual hallucinations , which means seeing things that are not there Problems with movement and posture , including slowness of movement, difficulty walking, and muscle stiffness. These are called parkinsonian motor symptoms. REM sleep behavior disorder , a condition in which a person seems to act out dreams. It may include vivid dreaming, talking in one's sleep, violent movements, or falling out of bed. This may be the earliest symptom of LBD in some people. It can appear several years before any other LBD symptoms. Changes in behavior and mood , such as depression , anxiety , and apathy (a lack of interest in normal daily activities or events) In the early stages of LBD, symptoms can be mild, and people can function fairly normally. As the disease gets worse, people with LBD need more help due to problems with thinking and movement. In the later stages of the disease, they often cannot care for themselves. How is Lewy body dementia (LBD) diagnosed? There isn't one test that can diagnose LBD. It is important to see an experienced doctor to get a diagnosis. This would usually be a specialist such as a neurologist. The doctor will: Do a medical history, including taking a detailed account of the symptoms. The doctor will talk to both the patient and caregivers. Do physical and neurological exams Do tests to rule out other conditions that could cause similar symptoms. These could include blood tests and brain imaging tests . Do neuropsychological tests to evaluate memory and other cognitive functions LBD can be hard to diagnose, because Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease cause similar symptoms. Scientists think that Lewy body disease might be related to these diseases, or that they sometimes happen together. It's also important to know which type of LBD a person has, so the doctor can treat that type's particular symptoms. It also helps the doctor understand how the disease will affect the person over time. The doctor makes a diagnosis based on when certain symptoms start: If cognitive symptoms start within a year of movement problems, the diagnosis is dementia with Lewy bodies If cognitive problems start more than a year after the movement problems, the diagnosis is Parkinson's disease dementia What are the treatments for Lewy body dementia (LBD)? There is no cure for LBD, but treatments can help with the symptoms: Medicines may help with some of the cognitive, movement, and psychiatric symptoms Physical therapy can help with movement problems Occupational therapy may help find ways to more easily do everyday activities Speech therapy may help with swallowing difficulties and trouble speaking loudly and clearly Mental health counseling can help people with LBD and their families learn how to manage difficult emotions and behaviors. It can also help them plan for the future. Music or art therapy may reduce anxiety and improve well-being Support groups can also be helpful for people with LBD and their caregivers. Support groups can give emotional and social support. They are also a place where people can share tips about how to deal with day-to-day challenges.

Lipid Metabolism Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/lipidmetabolismdisorders.html,"Metabolism is the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Food is made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Chemicals in your digestive system (enzymes) break the food parts down into sugars and acids, your body's fuel. Your body can use this fuel right away, or it can store the energy in your body tissues. If you have a metabolic disorder , something goes wrong with this process. Lipid metabolism disorders, such as Gaucher disease and Tay-Sachs disease , involve lipids. Lipids are fats or fat-like substances. They include oils, fatty acids, waxes, and cholesterol. If you have one of these disorders, you may not have enough enzymes to break down lipids. Or the enzymes may not work properly and your body can't convert the fats into energy. They cause a harmful amount of lipids to build up in your body. Over time, that can damage your cells and tissues, especially in the brain, peripheral nervous system, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Many of these disorders can be very serious, or sometimes even fatal. These disorders are inherited. Newborn babies get screened for some of them, using blood tests. If there is a family history of one of these disorders, parents can get genetic testing to see whether they carry the gene. Other genetic tests can tell whether the fetus has the disorder or carries the gene for the disorder. Enzyme replacement therapies can help with a few of these disorders.

Low Blood Pressure,https://medlineplus.gov/lowbloodpressure.html,"You've probably heard that high blood pressure is a problem. Sometimes blood pressure that is too low can also cause problems. Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps out blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is the diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually they're written one above or before the other, such as 120/80.

The more years you smoke and the more cigarettes you smoke each day, the more your risk goes up.  Your risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked. Secondhand smoke , which is the combination of the smoke that comes from a cigarette and the smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you breathe in secondhand smoke, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts. A family history of lung cancer. Being exposed to asbestos , arsenic , chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace. Being exposed to radiation , for example from: Radiation therapy to the breast or chest Radon in the home or workplace Certain imaging tests such as CT scans HIV infection . Your risk is higher if you have HIV. However, smoking rates are higher in people who have HIV, so it's not clear whether the increased risk is from the HIV infection or from smoking. Air pollution . Studies show that living in areas with higher levels of air pollution increases your risk of lung cancer. What are the symptoms of lung cancer? Lung cancer may not cause any signs or symptoms until the cancer is advanced. Sometimes the cancer is found during a chest x-ray done for another condition. The symptoms of lung cancer may include: Chest pain or discomfort A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time Coughing up blood Trouble breathing Wheezing Hoarseness Loss of appetite Weight loss for no known reason Feeling very tired Trouble swallowing Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck How is lung cancer diagnosed? To find out if you have lung cancer, your health care provider: Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms Will ask about your family history Will do a physical exam May order certain imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan May order lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum May do a procedure to take a biopsy of the lung If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out if it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need. If you have small-cell lung cancer, your provider may also do genetic testing to look for certain gene changes ( variants ) in your cancer cells. The results of the testing may help guide treatment. What are the treatments for lung cancer? For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer. Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment. The treatments for small cell lung cancer may include: Surgery. Chemotherapy . Radiation therapy. Immunotherapy . Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells. Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue. The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer may include: Surgery. Radiation therapy. Chemotherapy. Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. Immunotherapy. Laser therapy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells. Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue. Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue. Can lung cancer be prevented? Avoiding the risk factors may help prevent lung cancer. For example, you can: Quit smoking . And if you don't smoke, don't start. Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work. Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test. NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus
Lung Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/lungdiseases.html,"When you breathe, your lungs take in oxygen from the air and deliver it to the bloodstream. The cells in your body need oxygen to work and grow.  During a normal day, you breathe nearly 25,000 times. People with lung disease have difficulty breathing. Millions of people in the U.S. have lung disease. If all types of lung disease are lumped together, it is the number three killer in the United States.

Lung Transplantation,https://medlineplus.gov/lungtransplantation.html,"A lung transplant removes a person's diseased lung and replaces it with a healthy one.  The healthy lung comes from a donor who has died. Some people get one lung during a transplant. Other people get two. Lung transplants are used for people who are likely to die from lung disease within 1 to 2 years. Their conditions are so severe that other treatments, such as medicines or breathing devices, no longer work.

Lupus,https://medlineplus.gov/lupus.html,"What is lupus? Lupus is a chronic (long-lasting) type of autoimmune disease .Autoimmune diseases happen when your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This attack causes inflammation. It can also damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, and brain. There are several types of lupus: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body. Cutaneous lupus affects the skin. It causes a rash or sores, usually after your skin is exposed to sunlight . The two major types of cutaneous lupus are discoid lupus and subacute cutaneous lupus. Drug-induced lupus is caused by a reaction to some medicines. The symptoms may start 3 to 6 months after starting the medicine. The symptoms usually go away when you stop taking the medicine. Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is caused by certain antibodies that are passed from the pregnant parent to the baby. What causes lupus? The cause of lupus is unknown. Researchers are studying what might cause or trigger the disease, such as: Genetics Environmental factors, such as viral infections , sunlight, certain medicines, and smoking Problems with the immune system Who is more likely to get lupus? Anyone can get lupus, but women get it much more often than men. Lupus is more common in African Americans than in White people. It is also more common in people of American Indian and Asian descent.  African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus. What are the symptoms of lupus? Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones are: Arthritis , causing painful and swollen joints and morning stiffness Fever Fatigue or feeling tired often Red rashes , most often on the face (also called the ""butterfly rash"") Chest pain when taking a deep breath Hair loss Pale or purple fingers or toes, from cold and stress ( Raynaud phenomenon ) Sensitivity to the sun Swelling in legs or around eyes Mouth ulcers Swollen glands Headache and dizziness Confusion and memory problems Symptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time. What other problems can lupus cause? Lupus causes inflammation throughout your body. This can cause problems in your organs, including: Kidney damage (lupus nephritis). Heart problems , including inflammation in the heart (myocarditis), heart valves , or lining of the heart muscle ( pericarditis ). Inflammation of blood vessels ( vasculitis ). Blood clots Inflammation of the tissue that surrounds the lungs ( pleurisy ). This can make it painful to breathe. Some people with lupus may be more likely to develop other conditions, such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis . How is lupus diagnosed? There is no specific test for lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases that cause similar symptoms. So it may take a while to get a diagnosis. To find out if you have lupus, your health care provider: Will ask about your symptoms, medical history, and family health history Will do a complete physical exam May order blood tests, such as ANA (antinuclear antibody) , antibodies, complete blood count , and complement tests May order other tests, such as urine tests May do biopsies : Skin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope) Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope) What are the treatments for lupus? There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it. People with lupus often need to see different providers. You will most likely have a primary care provider and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in diseases of the joints and muscles). Which other specialists you will depend on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus is damaging your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases). Your primary care provider should coordinate care between all of your other providers and treat other problems as they come up. You and your primary care provider will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You will both review the plan often to make sure that it is working. You should report new symptoms to your provider right away so that your treatment plan can be changed, if needed. The goals of a treatment plan are to: Prevent flares Treat flares when they occur Reduce organ damage and other problems Improve your quality of life Treatments may include drugs to: Reduce fever, swelling, and pain Reduce inflammation in your body Prevent or reduce flares Reduce or prevent damage to joints Suppress (lower) the activity of your immune system Besides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol , high blood pressure , or infection. Alternative and complementary therapies are therapies that are not part of standard treatments. Some people try alternative and complementary therapies to improve their lupus symptoms. But research has not clearly shown whether these treatments may help or treat lupus. Talk to your provider before trying any new treatments. How can I cope with lupus? It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe. It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.

Lyme Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/lymedisease.html,"What is Lyme disease? Lyme disease is a bacterial infection you get from the bite of an infected tick . At first, Lyme disease usually causes symptoms such as a rash , fever , headache , and fatigue .  But if it is not treated early, the infection can spread to your joints, heart, and nervous system. Prompt treatment can help you recover quickly. What causes Lyme disease? Lyme disease is caused by bacteria. In the United States, this is usually a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi . It spreads to humans through the bite of an infected tick. The ticks that spread it are blacklegged ticks (or deer ticks). They are usually found in the: Northeast Mid-Atlantic Upper Midwest Pacific coast, especially northern California These ticks can attach to any part of your body. But they are often found in hard-to-see areas such as your groin, armpits, and scalp. Usually, the tick must be attached to you for more than 24 hours to spread the bacterium to you. Who is more likely to get Lyme disease? Most tick bites happen in the warmer months (April-September), when ticks are most active and people spend more time outdoors. But you can also get bitten during the rest of the year, especially if the temperatures are warmer than usual. Most tick bites happen in the summer months when ticks are most active and people spend more time outdoors. But you can get bitten in the warmer months of early fall, or even late winter if temperatures are unusually high. And if there is a mild winter, ticks may come out earlier than usual. What are the symptoms of Lyme disease? Early symptoms of Lyme disease start between 3 to 30 days after an infected tick bites you. The symptoms can include: A red rash called erythema migrans (EM). Most people with Lyme disease get this rash. It gets bigger over several days and may feel warm. It is usually not painful or itchy. As it starts to get better, parts of it may fade. Sometimes this makes the rash look like a ""bull's-eye."" Fever Chills Headache Fatigue Muscle and joint aches Swollen lymph nodes (""swollen glands"") If the infection is not treated, it can spread to your joints, heart, and nervous system. The symptoms may include: Severe headaches and neck stiffness. More EM rashes on other areas of your body. Facial palsy, which is a weakness in your facial muscles. It can cause drooping on one or both sides of your face. Arthritis with severe joint pain and swelling, especially in your knees and other large joints. Pain that comes and goes in your tendons, muscles, joints, and bones. Heart palpitations, which are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, pounding, or beating too hard or too fast. An irregular heart beat (Lyme carditis). Episodes of dizziness or shortness of breath. Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Nerve pain. Shooting pains, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet. How is Lyme disease diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will consider: Your symptoms How likely it is that you were exposed to infected blacklegged ticks How likely it is that you could have other illnesses that cause similar symptoms The results of any lab tests Most Lyme disease tests check for antibodies made by the body in response to infection. These antibodies can take several weeks to develop. If you are tested right away, it may not show that you have Lyme disease, even if you have it. So you may need to have another test later. What are the treatments for Lyme disease? Lyme disease is treated with antibiotics . The earlier you are treated, the better; it gives you the best chance of fully recovering quickly. After treatment, some patients may still have pain, fatigue, or difficulty thinking that lasts more than 6 months. This is called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Researchers don't know why some people have PTLDS. There is no proven treatment for PTLDS; long-term antibiotics have not been shown to help. However, there are ways to help with the symptoms of PTLDS. If you have been treated for Lyme disease and still feel unwell, contact your health care provider about how to manage your symptoms. Most people do get better with time. But it can take several months before you feel better. Can Lyme disease be prevented? To prevent Lyme disease, you should lower your risk of getting a tick bite: Avoid areas where ticks live, such as grassy, brushy, or wooded areas. If you are hiking, walk in the center of the trail to avoid brush and grass. Use an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent when you go outdoors. They are evaluated to make sure they are safe and effective. Make sure that the repellant has one of these ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or para-menthane-diol. It is important to follow the instructions on the label. Treat your clothing and gear with a repellant containing 0.5% permethrin Wear light-colored protective clothing, so you can easily see any ticks that get on you Wear a long-sleeved shirt and long pants. Also tuck your shirt into your pants and your pant legs into your socks. Check yourself, your children, and your pets daily for ticks. Carefully remove any ticks you find. Take a shower and wash and dry your clothes at high temperatures after being outdoors Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus

Lymphoma,https://medlineplus.gov/lymphoma.html,"Lymphoma is a cancer of a part of the immune system called the lymph system.  There are many types of lymphoma.  One type is Hodgkin disease .  The rest are called non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas begin when a type of white blood cell, called a T cell or B cell, becomes abnormal. The cell divides again and again, making more and more abnormal cells. These abnormal cells can spread to almost any other part of the body. Most of the time, doctors don't know why a person gets non-Hodgkin lymphoma. You are at increased risk if you have a weakened immune system or have certain types of infections. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can cause many symptoms, such as : Swollen, painless lymph nodes in the neck, armpits or groin Unexplained weight loss Fever Soaking night sweats Coughing, trouble breathing or chest pain Weakness and tiredness that don't go away Pain, swelling or a feeling of fullness in the abdomen Your doctor will diagnose lymphoma with a physical exam, blood tests, a chest x-ray, and a biopsy.  Treatments include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, biological therapy, or therapy to remove proteins from the blood. Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer.

Macular Degeneration,https://medlineplus.gov/maculardegeneration.html,"Macular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older. It is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving. AMD affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt, but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. You gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked. Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision.

Health care providers use mammograms to look for early signs of breast cancer . There are two types of mammograms: screening mammograms and diagnostic mammograms. What is a screening mammogram? A screening mammogram is a mammogram usually done for women who have no signs or symptoms of breast cancer. Regular screening mammograms can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer among women ages 40 to 74. This is because they can find breast cancer early and treatment can start earlier, maybe before it has spread. But screening mammograms can also have risks. They can sometimes find something that looks abnormal but isn't cancer. This leads to further testing and can cause you anxiety. Sometimes mammograms can miss cancer when it is there. It also exposes you to radiation . You should talk to your provider about the benefits and drawbacks of mammograms. Together, you can decide when to start and how often to have a mammogram. What is a diagnostic mammogram? A diagnostic mammogram is done for people who have a lump or other signs or symptoms of breast cancer. The signs can include breast pain, thickening of the skin of the breast, nipple discharge, or a change in breast size or shape. But these signs can also be caused by a breast condition that is benign (not cancer). A mammogram, along with other tests, can help your provider figure out whether you have cancer. How is a mammogram done? When you have a mammogram, you stand in front of an x-ray machine. The person who takes the x-rays places your breast between two plastic plates. The plates press your breast and make it flat. This may be uncomfortable, but it helps get a clear picture. You will get both breasts x-rayed from the front and from the side. Afterwards, a radiologist (a doctor with special training) will read the mammogram. The doctor will look at the x-ray for early signs of breast cancer or other problems. You will usually get the results within a few weeks, although it depends on the clinic or medical office that you went to. If your results are not normal, you should hear back earlier. Contact your provider or the office where you had the mammogram if you do not receive a report of your results within 30 days. What happens if my mammogram is not normal? An abnormal (not normal) mammogram does not always mean that there is cancer. You will need to have additional mammograms, tests, or exams before your provider can tell for sure. You may also be referred to a breast specialist or a surgeon. But it does not necessarily mean you have cancer or need surgery.

Medicines and Children,https://medlineplus.gov/medicinesandchildren.html,"Children aren't just small adults. It is especially important to remember this when giving medicines to children. Giving a child the wrong dose or a medicine that is not for children can have serious side effects. The drug labels for prescription medicines have a section on ""Pediatric Use."" It says whether the medicine has been studied for its effects on children. It also tells you which age groups were studied. Some over-the-counter (OTC) medicines , like those that treat fever and pain, have been studied for effectiveness, safety, or dosing in children.  But many other OTC medicines have not. It is important to read the labels carefully, to make sure that the medicine is right for your child. Here are some other tips for giving medicine safely to your child: Read and follow the label directions every time. Pay special attention to usage directions and warnings. Watch out for problems. Contact your health care provider or pharmacist right away if You notice any new symptoms or unexpected side effects in your child The medicine doesn't appear to be working when you expect it to. For example, antibiotics may take a few days to start working, but a pain reliever usually starts working soon after your child takes it. Know the abbreviations for the amounts of medicines: Tablespoon (tbsp.) Teaspoon (tsp.) Milligram (mg.) Milliliter (mL.) Ounce (oz.) Use the correct dosing device. If the label says two teaspoons and you're using a dosing cup with ounces only, don't try to guess how many teaspoons it would be. Get the proper measuring device. Don't substitute another item, such as a kitchen spoon. Check with your health care provider or pharmacist before giving two medicines at the same time. That way, you can avoid a possible overdose or an unwanted interaction. Follow age and weight limit recommendations. If the label says don't give to children under a certain age or weight, then don't do it. Always use the child-resistant cap and re-lock the cap after each use. Also, keep all medicines out of the reach of children. Ask your health care provider or pharmacist if you have any questions. Food and Drug Administration",MedlinePlus

Meningococcal disease is the name for any illness that is caused by Neisseria meningitidis bacteria (also called meningococcal bacteria). These illnesses are often severe and can sometimes be deadly. They include infections of the lining of the brain and spinal cord ( meningitis ) and in the bloodstream ( sepsis ). Vaccines can help prevent the disease. What causes meningococcal disease? Some people have Neisseria meningitidis , the bacteria that cause the disease, in the back of their nose and throat. They usually have the bacteria but don't get sick. This is called being a ""carrier."" But sometimes the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body and cause meningococcal disease. The bacteria can spread from person to person through saliva (spit). It usually happens through close or lengthy contact with a person who has it. Close contact can include things like kissing and coughing. You cannot catch the bacteria through casual contact with someone who has the disease. For example, you cannot get it by breathing air where that person has been. Who is more likely to get meningococcal disease? Anyone can get meningococcal disease, but you are more likely to get it if someone you live with has it. You are also more likely to get it if you have direct contact with the saliva of someone who has it (like through kissing). Also, certain groups of people are more likely to get the disease. They include: Children younger than 1 year old. Teens and young adults ages 16 through 23 years old. Adults 65 years and older. People with medical conditions that weaken their immune system , including those with HIV and certain rare immune system diseases. People who either don't have a spleen or have a spleen that does not function well. People who take complement inhibitor. These are immunotherapy medicines that are given to people with certain rare conditions. People who live in crowded settings, such as college dorms or military barracks. People who travel to areas where the disease is more common, such as certain parts of sub-Saharan Africa. What are the symptoms of meningococcal disease? There are different types of meningococcal disease. The most common types are meningitis and septicemia. Both types are very serious and can be deadly in a matter of hours. Meningococcal meningitis is a meningococcal infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord. The most common symptoms include: Fever Headache Stiff neck It can also cause symptoms such as: Nausea and vomiting Photophobia (your eyes being more sensitive to light) Confusion It may be hard to notice these symptoms in newborns and babies. They can also have different symptoms. They may: Be slow or inactive Be irritable Vomit Feed poorly Have a bulging of the soft spot of their skull Meningococcal septicemia is a meningococcal infection of the bloodstream. It's also called meningococcemia. When someone has this disease, the bacteria enter the bloodstream and multiply. This damages the walls of the blood vessels and causes bleeding into the skin and organs. The symptoms may include: Fever and chills Fatigue Vomiting Cold hands and feet Severe aches or pain in the muscles, joints, chest , or abdomen (belly) Rapid breathing Diarrhea A dark purple rash (in the later stages of the disease) Because it is so serious, you need to seek immediate medical attention if you or your child develops the symptoms of meningococcal disease. How is meningococcal disease diagnosed? The signs and symptoms of meningococcal disease are often similar to those of other illnesses. This can make it hard to diagnose. If your (or your child's) health care provider thinks that you or your child could have meningococcal disease, they will order tests that take samples of blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (fluid near the spinal cord). They will send the samples to a lab for testing. The testing will include bacteria culture testing , which can identify the specific type of bacteria that is causing the infection. Knowing this can help the provider decide on the best treatment. What are the treatments for meningococcal disease? Certain antibiotics can treat meningococcal disease. It is important that treatment is started as soon as possible. So if the provider thinks you have meningococcal disease, they will give you antibiotics right away (before the test results come back). People with serious disease may need additional treatments, such as: Breathing support Medicines to treat low blood pressure Surgery to remove dead tissue Wound care for parts of the body with damaged skin Some people with meningococcal disease will have long-term health problems and disabilities . These may include: Loss of limb(s) Deafness Nervous system problems Brain damage Even with treatment, 10 to 15 in 100 people will die from the disease. Can meningococcal disease be prevented? The best way to prevent meningococcal disease is to get vaccinated. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends meningococcal vaccination for: All preteens and teens Children at higher risk for meningococcal disease Adults at higher risk for meningococcal disease If you are a close contact of a person with meningococcal disease, you will likely be given antibiotics to prevent you from getting sick. This is called ""prophylaxis.""  Close contacts include people who are living together. They also include people who had direct contact with the saliva of a person who has the disease (such as from kissing). Although it's rare, you can get meningococcal disease more than once.

Menopause,https://medlineplus.gov/menopause.html,"What is menopause? Menopause is the time in your life when you stop having your period and can no longer get pregnant. You have reached menopause when you have not had a period for 12 months. The time leading up to menopause is called the menopausal transition, or perimenopause. This transition usually begins in when you are in your 40s, but sometimes it can start earlier. It can last for several years. The most common age for reaching menopause is between 45 and 55 years old. What is early menopause? Early, or premature menopause happens when your ovaries stop making hormones and periods stop before age 40. This can happen on its own (with no known cause). It can also happen because of surgery to remove the ovaries or uterus . Medical treatments such as chemotherapy or hormone therapy to treat breast cancer may also cause early menopause. A condition called primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) happens when your ovaries stop working normally before you are age 40. But this condition is different from early menopause. If you have POI, you may still have periods, even though they might not come regularly. And you might still be able to get pregnant. What are the symptoms of menopause? During the menopausal transition, your ovaries start to make less of the estrogen and progesterone hormones. The changes in these hormones cause the symptoms of menopause, which can include: A change in your periods; they may be: Irregular, with more or less time in between periods. Shorter or longer. Lighter or heavier. Hot flashes, a sudden warm feeling in your face, neck, and chest. They may cause you to sweat . If they happen at night and cause sweating, they are called night sweats. Trouble sleeping , such as trouble falling asleep or getting back to sleep when you wake up. Over time, a lack of sleep can lead to fatigue and memory problems . Vaginal dryness, which may cause pain or discomfort during sexual intercourse. Mood changes, which can make you feel moody, anxious, or more irritable. Bladder issues, such as urinary incontinence (loss of bladder control) and urinary tract infections (UTIs). You may also have other physical changes which could put you at risk for certain diseases. For example, the loss of estrogen can: Cause you to lose bone density . This can lead to osteoporosis , a condition that causes bones to become weak and break easily. Raise your cholesterol levels and increase your risk of heart disease and stroke . What are the treatments for the symptoms of menopause? You may not need treatment for the symptoms of menopause. But if you do, there are several different types of treatments: Lifestyle changes You may find that you can manage your symptoms with lifestyle changes. Here are some changes that might make you feel better: If you have hot flashes, dress in layers that can be removed at the start of a hot flash. You may want to carry a portable fan to use when you get a hot flash. Avoid alcohol , spicy foods, and caffeine . They can make your menopause symptoms worse. If you smoke, try to quit , not only for hot flashes, but for your overall health. Try to maintain a healthy weight . Being overweight or having obesity can make hot flashes worse. Have good sleep habits . Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool. Get regular exercise . It can help you sleep better, improve your mood, and help lower your risk for many age-related diseases. Lower stress , for example by using relaxation techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, and muscle relaxation exercises. If lifestyle changes are not enough to improve your symptoms, you may want to contact your health care provider. They will talk to you about your symptoms, family and medical history, and preferences. They also can explain the risks and benefits of the treatments. Non-hormone treatments There are various non-hormone treatments for menopause symptoms, such as: Medicines for hot flashes, including certain antidepressants , a medicine just for hot flashes, an antiseizure medicine, and a blood pressure medicine . Some of these medicines may also help with sleep problems. Medicines for urinary incontinence. Medicines to treat or help prevent osteoporosis. Low-dose birth control pills for very heavy bleeding or periods that are close together. Water-based lubricants to treat vaginal dryness. Medicines for painful intercourse that is caused by vaginal changes from menopause. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of talk therapy, for trouble sleeping. Hormone treatments Another treatment for menopause symptoms is menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). It may also be called hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This treatment is usually with estrogen or estrogen plus progestin (a type of progesterone that's made in a lab). MHT can be given in pills, skin patches, rings, implants, gels, or creams. It may be used to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness and to help prevent osteoporosis. Like all medicines, MHT has benefits and risks. Talk with your provider about whether it is safe for you. If you decide to take MHT, your provider may recommend taking the lowest dose that works for the shortest time needed. Supplements, herbs, and ""natural"" hormone creams There are various products that are marketed for menopause symptoms. They include supplements , herbs , and over-the-counter ""natural"" hormone creams. There has been research on many of these products. So far, none of them has clearly been shown to be helpful. Also, there is little information on the long-term safety of these products. Some supplements can have harmful side effects or interact with medicines.

It can also be mixed with liquid and injected into your body with a needle. Crystal meth is smoked in a small glass pipe. Meth at first causes a rush of good feelings, but then users feel edgy, overly excited, angry, or afraid.  Meth use can quickly lead to addiction. It causes medical problems including: Making your body temperature so high that you pass out Severe itching ""Meth mouth"" - broken teeth and dry mouth Thinking and emotional problems NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse",MedlinePlus
Migraine,https://medlineplus.gov/migraine.html,"What are migraines? Migraines are a recurring type of headache. They cause moderate to severe pain that is throbbing or pulsing. The pain is often on one side of your head. You may also have other symptoms, such as nausea and weakness. You may be sensitive to light and sound. What causes migraines? Researchers believe that migraine has a genetic cause. There are also a number of factors that can trigger a migraine. These factors vary from person to person, and they include: Stress Anxiety Hormonal changes in women Bright or flashing lights Loud noises Strong smells Medicines Too much or not enough sleep Sudden changes in weather or environment Overexertion (too much physical activity) Tobacco Caffeine or caffeine withdrawal Skipped meals Medication overuse (taking medicine for migraines too often) Some people have found that certain foods or ingredients can trigger headaches, especially when they are combined with other triggers. These foods and ingredients include: Alcohol Chocolate Aged cheeses Monosodium glutamate (MSG) Some fruits and nuts Fermented or pickled goods Yeast Cured or processed meats Who is at risk for migraines? About 12% of Americans get migraines. They can affect anyone, but you are more likely to have them if you: Are a woman. Women are three times more likely than men to get migraines. Have a family history of migraines. Most people with migraines have family members who have migraines. Have other medical conditions, such as depression , anxiety , bipolar disorder , sleep disorders , and epilepsy . What are the symptoms of migraines? There are four different phases of migraines. You may not always go through every phase each time you have a migraine.: Prodome. This phase starts up to 24 hours before you get the migraine. You have early signs and symptoms, such as food cravings, unexplained mood changes, uncontrollable yawning, fluid retention, and increased urination. Aura. If you have this phase, you might see flashing or bright lights or zig-zag lines. You may have muscle weakness or feel like you are being touched or grabbed. An aura can happen just before or during a migraine. Headache. A migraine usually starts gradually and then becomes more severe. It typically causes throbbing or pulsing pain, which is often on one side of your head. But sometimes you can have a migraine without a headache. Other migraine symptoms may include Increased sensitivity to light, noise, and odors Nausea and vomiting Worsened pain when you move, cough, or sneeze Postdrome (following the headache). You may feel exhausted, weak, and confused after a migraine. This can last up to a day. Migraines are more common in the morning; people often wake up with them. Some people have migraines at predictable times, such as before menstruation or on weekends following a stressful week of work. How are migraines diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will: Take your medical history Ask about your symptoms Do a physical and neurological exam An important part of diagnosing migraines is to rule out other medical conditions which could be causing the symptoms. So you may also have blood tests, an MRI or CT scan, or other tests. How are migraines treated? There is no cure for migraines. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing additional attacks. There are different types of medicines to relieve symptoms. They include triptan drugs, ergotamine drugs, and pain relievers . The sooner you take the medicine, the more effective it is. There are also other things you can do to feel better: Resting with your eyes closed in a quiet, darkened room Placing a cool cloth or ice pack on your forehead Drinking fluids There are some lifestyle changes you can make to prevent migraines: Stress management strategies, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, and biofeedback, may reduce the number and severity of migraines. Biofeedback uses electronic devices to teach you to control certain body functions, such as your heartbeat, blood pressure, and muscle tension. Make a log of what seems to trigger your migraines. You can learn what you need to avoid, such as certain foods and medicines. It also help you figure out what you should do, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule and eating regular meals. Hormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be linked to their menstrual cycle If you have obesity , losing weight may also be helpful If you have frequent or severe migraines, you may need to take medicines to prevent further attacks. Talk with your health care provider about which drug would be right for you. Certain natural treatments, such as riboflavin (vitamin B2) and coenzyme Q10, may help prevent migraines. If your magnesium level is low, you can try taking magnesium. There is also an herb, butterbur, which some people take to prevent migraines. But butterbur may not be safe for long-term use. Always check with your health care provider before taking any supplements. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",MedlinePlus
Mild Cognitive Impairment,https://medlineplus.gov/mildcognitiveimpairment.html,"Some forgetfulness can be a normal part of aging.   However, some people have more memory problems than other people their age. This condition is called mild cognitive impairment, or MCI. People with MCI can take care of themselves and do their normal activities. MCI memory problems may include: Losing things often Forgetting to go to events and appointments Having more trouble coming up with words than other people of the same age Memory problems can also have other causes, including certain medicines and diseases that affect the blood vessels that supply the brain. Some of the problems brought on by these conditions can be managed or reversed. Your health care provider can do thinking, memory, and language tests to see if you have MCI. You may also need to see a specialist for more tests. Because MCI may be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease , it's really important to see your health care provider every 6 to 12 months.

Miscarriage,https://medlineplus.gov/miscarriage.html,"A miscarriage is an unexpected loss of pregnancy before the 20th week of pregnancy. Most miscarriages happen very early in the pregnancy, often before a woman even knows she is pregnant. Factors that may contribute to miscarriage include: A genetic problem with the fetus Problems with the uterus or cervix Chronic diseases, such as polycystic ovary syndrome Signs of a miscarriage include vaginal spotting, abdominal pain or cramping, and fluid or tissue passing from the vagina. Bleeding can be a symptom of miscarriage, but many women also have it in early pregnancy and don't miscarry. To be sure, contact your health care provider right away if you have bleeding. Women who miscarry early in their pregnancy usually do not need any treatment. In some cases, there is tissue left in the uterus. Doctors use a procedure called a dilatation and curettage (D&C) or medicines to remove the tissue. Counseling may help you cope with your grief. Later, if you do decide to try again, work closely with your health care provider to lower the risks. Many women who have a miscarriage go on to have healthy babies.

Mitochondrial Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/mitochondrialdiseases.html,"Metabolism is the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Food is made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Chemicals in your digestive system (enzymes) break the food parts down into sugars and acids, your body's fuel. Your body can use this fuel right away, or it can store the energy in your body tissues. If you have a metabolic disorder , something goes wrong with this process. Mitochondrial diseases are a group of metabolic disorders. Mitochondria are small structures that produce energy in almost all of your cells. They make it by combining oxygen with the fuel molecules (sugars and fats) that come from your food. When the mitochondria are defective, the cells do not have enough energy. The unused oxygen and fuel molecules build up in the cells and cause damage. The symptoms of mitochondrial disease can vary. It depends on how many mitochondria are defective, and where they are in the body. Sometimes only one organ, tissue, or cell type is affected. But often the problem affects many of them. Muscle and nerve cells have especially high energy needs, so muscular and neurological problems are common. The diseases range from mild to severe. Some types can be fatal. Genetic mutations cause these diseases. They usually happen before age 20, and some are more common in infants. There are no cures for these diseases, but treatments may help with symptoms and slow down the disease. They may include physical therapy, vitamins and supplements, special diets, and medicines.",MedlinePlus
Mitral Valve Prolapse,https://medlineplus.gov/mitralvalveprolapse.html,"What is the mitral valve? The mitral valve is one of the four valves in your heart. Heart valves have flaps that open and close. The flaps make sure that blood flows in the right direction through your heart and to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats, they close to stop the blood from flowing backwards. The mitral valve opens to let blood flow from your heart's upper left chamber to the lower left chamber. When the lower left chamber contracts (squeezes) to pump blood to your body, the mitral valve closes tightly to keep any blood from flowing backwards. What is mitral valve prolapse (MVP)? Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) happens when the flaps of the mitral valve become floppy and don't close tightly. In some cases, blood may leak backwards through the valve to the chamber it came from. This is called backflow, or regurgitation. When there is a lot of mitral valve backflow, the heart can't push enough blood out to the body. But most people who have MVP don't have any backflow. In fact, MVP doesn't cause any health problems for most people who have it. Who is more likely to develop mitral valve prolapse (MVP)? Anyone can have MVP. Most people who have it were born with it. MVP tends to run in families, but researchers don't know the exact cause. You may be more likely to develop MVP if you: Are older. The risk of MVP increases as aging affects the valve. Had rheumatic fever, a disease that can develop after a strep throat infection and cause damage to the heart valves. Were born with a connective tissue disorder , such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome . Have Graves' disease , a type of thyroid condition. Have scoliosis (a side-to-side curve of the spine) or other problems with the bones of your body. Have some types of muscular dystrophy . Mitral valve prolapse with backflow is most common in men and people who have high blood pressure . What are the symptoms of mitral valve prolapse (MVP)? Most people who have MVP don't have any symptoms. But if it does cause symptoms, they may include: Heart palpitations (feeling that your heart is fluttering, skipping beats, or beating too hard or too fast) Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air) A cough Fatigue , dizziness , or anxiety Migraines Chest pain What other problems can mitral valve prolapse (MVP) cause? In rare cases, MVP can cause other problems. They're most often caused by backflow. They can include: Arrhythmia , a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat Endocarditis , an infection in the lining of the heart and heart valves Heart failure How is mitral valve prolapse (MVP) diagnosed? Health care providers often find MVP during routine health check-ups. If you have MVP, your provider may hear a clicking sound when listening to your heart with a stethoscope. If blood flows backwards through the valve, your heart may also make a whooshing sound called a heart murmur. You may also need certain heart tests . The most useful test is an echocardiogram, or echo. This is a type of ultrasound that uses sound waves to make a moving picture of your heart. What are the treatments for mitral valve prolapse (MVP)? Most people don't need any treatment for MVP. If you have symptoms with little or no backflow, you may only need medicine to relieve your discomfort. If the amount of backflow is significant, you may need treatment to prevent other heart problems from developing. Treatments may include: Medicines to help your heart work better. Heart surgery to repair or replace a very abnormal mitral valve with backflow. The goal of surgery is to improve your symptoms and reduce your risk of developing heart failure. When possible, valve repair is generally preferred over replacement. That's because repairs are less likely to weaken the heart muscle, and they're less likely to cause heart infection. Can mitral valve prolapse be prevented? You can't prevent mitral valve prolapse. But if you have mitral valve prolapse, you can help prevent the rare but serious problems it can cause by: Brushing and flossing your teeth regularly . That helps keep bacteria out of your bloodstream, which further reduces the rare risk of a heart infection. Asking your provider if you need to take antibiotics before dental work or surgery to lower your risk of heart infection. This mostly applies to people who have had valve repair or replacement surgery. Getting regular check-ups and taking any medicines that your provider may have prescribed.

Mosquito Bites,https://medlineplus.gov/mosquitobites.html,"Mosquitoes are insects that live all over the world. There are thousands of different species of mosquitoes; about 200 of those live in the United States. Female mosquitoes bite animals and humans and drink a very small amount of their blood. They need protein and iron from blood to produce eggs. After drinking blood, they find some standing water and lay their eggs in it. The eggs hatch into larvae, then pupae, and then they become adult mosquitos. The males live for about a week to ten days, and the females can live up to several weeks. Some female mosquitoes can hibernate in the winter, and they can live for months. What health problems can mosquito bites cause? Most mosquito bites are harmless, but there are times when they can be dangerous. The ways that mosquito bites can affect humans include: Causing itchy bumps , as an immune system response to the mosquito's saliva. This is the most common reaction. The bumps usually go away after a day or two. Causing allergic reactions , including blisters, large hives, and in rare cases, anaphylaxis . Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that affects the whole body. It is a medical emergency. Spreading diseases to humans . Some of these diseases can be serious. Many of them do not have any treatments, and only a few have vaccines to prevent them. These diseases are more of a problem in Africa and other tropical areas of the world, but more of them are spreading to the United States. One factor is climate change , which makes the conditions in some parts of the United States more favorable to certain types of mosquitoes. Other reasons include increased trade with, and travel to, tropical and subtropical areas. Which diseases can mosquitoes spread? Common diseases spread by mosquitoes include: Chikungunya , a viral infection that causes symptoms such as fever and severe joint pain. The symptoms usually last about a week, but for some, the joint pain may last for months. Most cases of chikungunya in the United States are in people who traveled to other countries. There have been a few cases where it has spread in the United States. Dengue , a viral infection that causes a high fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, vomiting, and a rash. Most people get better within a few weeks. In some cases, it can become very severe, even life-threatening. Dengue is rare in the United States. Malaria , a parasitic disease that causes serious symptoms such as high fevers, shaking chills, and flu-like illness. It can be life-threatening, but there are drugs to treat it. Malaria is a major health problem in many tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Almost all cases of malaria in the United States are in people who traveled to other countries. West Nile Virus (WNV), a viral infection that often has no symptoms. In those that do have symptoms, they are usually mild, and include fever, headache, and nausea. In rare cases, the virus can enter the brain, and it can be life-threatening. WNV has spread across the continental United States. Zika Virus , a viral infection that often does not cause symptoms. One in five infected people do get symptoms, which are usually mild. They include a fever, rash, joint pain, and pink eye. Besides being spread by mosquitoes, Zika can spread from mother to baby during pregnancy and cause serious birth defects. It can also spread from one partner to another during sex. There have been a few outbreaks of Zika in the southern United States. Can mosquito bites be prevented? Use an insect repellent when you go outdoors. Choose an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent. They are evaluated to make sure they are safe and effective. Make sure that the repellant has one of these ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or para-menthane-diol. It is important to follow the instructions on the label. Cover up. Wear long sleeves, long pants, and socks when outdoors. Mosquitoes may bite through thin fabric, so spray thin clothes with an EPA-registered repellent like permethrin. Don't apply permethrin directly to skin. Mosquito-proof your home. Install or repair screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out. Use air conditioning if you have it. Get rid of mosquito breeding sites. Regularly empty standing water from your house and yard. The water could be in flowerpots, gutters, buckets, pool covers, pet water dishes, discarded tires, or birdbaths. If you plan to travel, get information about the areas you will be going to. Find out whether there is a risk of diseases from mosquitoes, and if so, whether there is a vaccine or medicine to prevent those diseases.

Mpox,https://medlineplus.gov/mpox.html,"What is mpox? Mpox, which used to be called monkeypox, is a disease caused by the monkeypox virus. This virus is in the same family of viruses as the smallpox virus. Mpox can be spread between animals and people, but it's mainly spread through close contact with someone who has it. It is found regularly in parts of Central, Eastern and West Africa. The virus that causes it has been found in small rodents, monkeys, and other mammals that live in these areas. Some outbreaks of mpox have affected people in many countries around the world, including the United States. What are the types of monkeypox viruses? There are two types of monkeypox viruses: Clade I is regularly found in Central and Eastern Africa. It causes more severe illness and deaths than clade II. Clade II is regularly found in West Africa. Infections from clade II are less severe. Most people who get this type will survive. This type is the cause of the global mpox outbreak that peaked in 2022 but has continued to decrease. How does mpox spread? Mpox spreads in different ways: Through close, personal contact with someone who has the virus: Through direct contact with their rash, scabs, or body fluids By breathing in the virus during prolonged, face-to-face contact During intimate physical contact such as kissing, cuddling, hugging, massage or sex During pregnancy, from the mother to the fetus. From touching items (such as clothes, bedding, or towels) that were used by someone who has the virus From infected animals: By being scratched or bitten by the animal By preparing or eating meat or using products from the animal Someone who has mpox can spread it from the time their symptoms start until their rash has fully healed, all scabs have fallen off, and a fresh layer of skin has formed.  This usually takes 2-4 weeks. Researchers have found that some people can spread mpox to others from 1 to 4 days before their symptoms appear. It is not known how often this happens. What are the symptoms of mpox? The symptoms of mpox usually start within 3 weeks from the time you were exposed to the virus. The symptoms may include: A rash with sores that can look like pimples or blisters. It could be on the face, inside the mouth, and on other parts of the body, like the hands, feet, chest, genitals, or anus. It goes through different stages, including scabs, before healing. This can take 2-4 weeks. Fever . Chills. Swollen lymph nodes (""swollen glands""). Exhaustion. Headache . Muscle aches and backache. Respiratory symptoms, such as a sore throat, nasal congestion, or cough . You may have all or only a few symptoms: You may get a rash first, followed by other symptoms You may have flu-like symptoms and then develop a rash 1-4 days later You may only get a rash How is mpox diagnosed? To find out if you have mpox, your health care provider: Will ask about your symptoms and medical history. Will look at your rash. Will take a sample of tissue from one of the sores so it can be tested for the monkeypox virus. May do blood tests to check for monkeypox virus or for antibodies to the virus. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight foreign substances such as viruses and bacteria . What are the treatments for mpox? There are no treatments specifically for mpox, but many people get better on their own. Since mpox and smallpox are similar, antiviral medicines that treat smallpox may also help treat mpox. Antiviral medicines may be recommended for people have severe mpox or are at risk of severe mpox, for example because they: Have immune system , for example from HIV or other conditions Are pregnant Are children, especially those under age 1 Have certain active skin conditions that can cause widespread infection, such as eczema , impetigo , or psoriasis If you have mpox, it is recommended that you stay home from the time you have symptoms until your mpox rash has healed and a new layer of skin has formed. It would be best to stay in a separate room from your family members and pets if you can. Can mpox be prevented? JYNNEOS is a vaccine that can help prevent mpox (and smallpox). The vaccine is given in two doses 4 weeks apart. Getting both doses gives the best protection. The vaccine is recommended for people who are at risk of mpox, for example because they: Had or think they could've had exposure to someone with mpox Are a man who has sex with men, who in the last 6 months had: One or more sexually transmitted infections (STIs) More than one sexual partner Sex at a commercial sex venue (like a sex club or bathhouse) Sex at a large public event where people had spread mpox Had a sex partner who is at risk of mpox Expect to be in any of these situations Are at risk of exposure at work, for example at a lab or healthcare facility Will be traveling to an area where there is an outbreak and, while there, will likely have sex: With a new partner At a commercial sex venue or large public event In exchange for money or drugs Check with your provider to see if the vaccine is recommended for you. There are also other steps you can take to help prevent mpox: Avoid close, skin-to-skin contact with the mpox rash. So, while a person is sick with mpox: Do not touch their rash or scabs Do not kiss, hug, cuddle, or have sex with them Avoid contact with items that were used by someone who has mpox: Do not touch the bedding, towels, or clothing of a person who has mpox Do not share eating utensils or cups with them If you or someone you live with has mpox, clean and disinfect your home Wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, especially after contact with sick people.

If you have symptoms, you may have chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, radiation, or targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus
Multiple Sclerosis,https://medlineplus.gov/multiplesclerosis.html,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a nervous system disease that affects your brain and spinal cord.  It damages the myelin sheath, the material that surrounds and protects your nerve cells. This damage slows down or blocks messages between your brain and your body, leading to the symptoms of MS. They can include: Visual disturbances Muscle weakness Trouble with coordination and balance Sensations such as numbness, prickling, or ""pins and needles"" Thinking and memory problems No one knows what causes MS. It may be an autoimmune disease, which happens when your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Multiple sclerosis affects women more than men. It often begins between the ages of 20 and 40.  Usually, the disease is mild, but some people lose the ability to write, speak, or walk. There is no specific test for MS.  Doctors use a medical history, physical exam, neurological exam, MRI, and other tests to diagnose it. There is no cure for MS, but medicines may slow it down and help control symptoms. Physical and occupational therapy may also help. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",MedlinePlus

Muscular Dystrophy,https://medlineplus.gov/musculardystrophy.html,"What is muscular dystrophy (MD)? Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of more than 30 genetic diseases . They cause weakness of the muscles. Over time, the weakness gets worse and can cause trouble walking and doing daily activities. Some types of MD can also affect other organs. What are the types of muscular dystrophy (MD)? There are many different types of MD. Some of the more common types include: Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is the most common childhood form. It is severe and affects boys more often than girls. The symptoms usually start between ages 3 and 6. Becker muscular dystrophy, which is similar to Duchenne but is less severe and gets worse more slowly. It often starts in the teenage years. Congenital muscular dystrophies, which are present at birth or before age 2. They can be mild or severe. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, which often starts in the teenage years. At first, it affects the muscles of the face, shoulders, and upper arms. Each of the types of MD can be different in many ways, such as: Who is more likely to get them Which muscles they affect When they appear, such as in infancy, childhood, middle age, or later What the symptoms are How serious the symptoms are How quickly they get worse Whether they run in families Whether they affect other organs Even within the same type of MD, people can have different symptoms. What causes muscular dystrophy (MD)? MD is genetic, meaning that it caused by a change in one or more genes. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. The gene changes in MD affect proteins that strengthen and protect muscles. There are different gene changes that cause each type of MD. And sometimes people who have the same type of MD can  have different gene changes. Muscular dystrophy can run in families, or you can be the first in your family to have a muscular dystrophy. How is muscular dystrophy (MD) diagnosed? To find out if you or your child has MD, your health care provider may use: A medical and family history A physical exam Blood and urine tests, including genetic tests and tests for certain enzymes that may be released by damaged muscles Muscle biopsies Electromyography and nerve conduction studies to find out if muscles are responding the right way to nerve signals Heart testing , such as an electrocardiogram (EKG), since some types of MD can cause heart problems Exercise tests to measure muscle strength and breathing and detect any increased rates of certain chemicals following exercise Imaging tests such as an MRI to look at muscle quality and bulk and measure fatty replacement of muscle tissue What are the treatments for muscular dystrophy (MD)? There is no cure for muscular dystrophy. Treatment can help with the symptoms and prevent complications. It usually includes a combination of therapies, such as: Physical therapy to help keep muscles flexible and strong Occupational therapy to relearn lost motor skills and learn ways to work around weakened muscles Respiratory care, such as breathing exercises, oxygen therapy , and ventilators Speech therapy to help with speech and swallowing problems Assistive devices , such as wheelchairs, splints and braces, and walkers Medicines to help delay damage to muscles or minimize the symptoms of MD Surgery to treat some of the conditions associated with MD, such as heart problems, scoliosis , and cataracts NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",MedlinePlus
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/myalgicencephalomyelitischronicfatiguesyndrome.html,"What is myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)? Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious, long-term illness that affects many body systems. Another name for it is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). ME/CFS can often make you unable to do your usual activities. Sometimes you may not even be able to get out of bed. What causes myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)? Researchers don't yet know what causes ME/CFS. There may be more than one potential cause. It is also possible that two or more triggers might work together to cause the illness. Researchers are studying many possible causes, including: Infections Immune system changes Physical or emotional stress Changes in the way cells in the body get their energy Genetics; the illness can sometimes run in families Who is more likely to develop myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)? Anyone can get ME/CFS, but it is most common in people between 40 and 60 years old. Adult women are more likely to develop it than adult men. What are the symptoms of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)? The primary, or core, symptoms of ME/CFS are: Not being able to do activities that you used to do before the illness, along with severe fatigue. The fatigue must last six months or longer, and it is not improved by rest. Post-exertional malaise (PEM), which means that your symptoms get worse after any physical or mental activity. Sleep problems . Along with the primary symptoms, to be diagnosed with ME/CFS, you need to have one or both of these symptoms: Problems with thinking and memory . Worsening of symptoms while standing or sitting upright. This is called orthostatic intolerance. It can cause you to feel lightheaded, dizzy , weak, or faint while standing or sitting up. Some of the other symptoms that ME/CFS can cause include: Pain , including muscle pain, joint pain, and headaches Sore throat Tender lymph nodes (glands) in the neck or armpits Digestive issues, like irritable bowel syndrome Chills and night sweats Allergies and sensitivities to foods, odors, chemicals, light, or noise ME/CFS can be unpredictable. Your symptoms may come and go. They may change over time; sometimes they might get better, and other times they may get worse. How is myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnosed? ME/CFS can be difficult to diagnose. There is no specific test for ME/CFS, and other illnesses can cause similar symptoms. Your health care provider has to rule out other diseases before making a diagnosis of ME/CFS. Your provider will do a thorough medical exam, which will include: Asking about your medical history and your family's medical history. Asking about your current illness, including your symptoms.  Some questions they may ask could include how often you have symptoms, how bad they are, how long they have lasted, and how they affect your life. Thorough physical and mental status exams. Blood, urine, or other tests to check for other illnesses which could be causing your symptoms. Your provider may also ask you to see a specialist to check for other conditions which can cause similar symptoms. What are the treatments for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)? There is no cure or approved treatment for ME/CFS, but you may be able to treat or manage some of your symptoms. You, your family, and your provider should work together to decide on a plan. You should figure out which symptom causes you the most problems and try to treat that first. For example, if sleep problems affect you the most, you might first try using good sleep habits . If those do not help, you may need to take medicines or see a sleep specialist. Strategies such as learning new ways to manage activity can also be helpful. You need to make sure that you do not ""push and crash."" This can happen when you feel better, do too much, and then get worse again. When you have ME/CFS, it can be hard to help develop a treatment plan. It can also be difficult to  try to take care of yourself.  So it's important that you have support from family members and friends. There are also various resources and strategies that might be helpful to you, such as: Getting counseling to help you cope with the illness and its impact on your life. Eating a healthy diet. Nutritional supplements, if your provider suggests them. Complementary therapies such as meditation, gentle massage, or relaxation therapy. Make sure to talk to your provider before you try any new treatments. Some treatments that are promoted as cures for ME/CFS are unproven, often costly, and could be dangerous.

Myasthenia Gravis,https://medlineplus.gov/myastheniagravis.html,"What is myasthenia gravis? Myasthenia gravis, sometimes called MG, is a chronic (long-lasting) disease that causes weakness in your voluntary muscles. The voluntary muscles are the ones that you can control. They include the muscles you use for: Eye and eyelid movement Facial expressions Chewing Talking Swallowing Breathing Moving your arms and legs You can also have weakness in other muscles. This weakness gets worse with activity, and better with rest. Myasthenia gravis is a type of autoimmune disease. In autoimmune diseases , your immune system attacks the healthy cells of your organs and tissues by mistake. What causes myasthenia gravis? Myasthenia gravis is caused by an error in how nerve signals are sent to muscles. These signals get blocked at the nerve-muscle junction. This junction is the place where the nerve endings connect with the muscles they control. Normally, this is how the signals work: The signals travel down a nerve that controls movement in the muscle The nerve endings release a substance called acetylcholine Acetylcholine binds to the muscle tissue at the nerve-muscle junction This causes the muscle to contract (move) But in someone with myasthenia gravis, the body's own immune system makes antibodies that block the binding of acetylcholine to the muscle. This makes the muscles weaker. The thymus gland, which is part of your immune system, may play a role in myasthenia gravis. Normally, your thymus gland is active and growing when you are a child. It makes white blood cells to fight infections. At puberty, it starts getting smaller and is replaced by fat. It is usually small by the time you are an adult. But in many adults with myasthenia gravis, the thymus gland stays large. And some people with myasthenia gravis can get thymomas, which are tumors of the thymus. The are usually benign (not cancer), but they can sometimes become cancerous . Who is more likely to develop myasthenia gravis? Although myasthenia gravis can affect people of any age, it is most common in young adult women (under age 40) and older men (over age 60). It is usually not inherited (passed down in families). Myasthenia gravis normally does not affect infants. But if you are pregnant and have myasthenia gravis it's possible to pass the antibodies to your fetus. The baby can then be born with neonatal myasthenia. This condition is usually temporary, and the symptoms typically go away within two to three months after birth. What are the symptoms of myasthenia gravis? The symptoms of myasthenia gravis will depend on which muscles are affected. The symptoms often include: Weakness of the eye muscles Drooping of one or both eyelids Blurred or double vision Changes in facial expressions Trouble swallowing Shortness of breath Speech problems Weakness in the arms, hands, fingers, legs, and neck Different people have different levels of muscle weakness. And the weakness can vary from day to day. Some days it might be mild, and other days it might be worse. Physical activity often makes the muscle weakness worse. Some people with myasthenia gravis can get severe weakness that  affects the muscles that control breathing. This is called a myasthenic crisis, and it is a life-threatening emergency. How is myasthenia gravis diagnosed? There are many other conditions that can cause muscle weakness, so myasthenia gravis can be hard to diagnose. To find out if you have myasthenia gravis, your health care provider: Will ask about your medical history and symptoms Will do a physical exam, including a neurological exam Will likely order tests for myasthenia gravis , including: Blood tests Imaging tests Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies What are the treatments for myasthenia gravis? There is no cure for myasthenia gravis, but treatments that can improve muscle weakness and help with symptoms. They include: Anticholinesterase medicines, which can improve nerve-to-muscle messages and make muscles stronger. Immunosuppressive medicines, which are medicines that decrease your body's immune system responses. They can lower your body's production of abnormal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies, which can also help decrease your body's immune system responses. Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) and intravenous immunoglobulin, which are procedures to remove abnormal antibodies from your blood. They are usually used in severe cases. They can help with symptoms for a few weeks or months. Thymectomy, surgery to remove the thymus gland. It can reduce the symptoms of myasthenia gravis, possibly by rebalancing the immune system. Lifestyle changes may be helpful for some people. The changes could include regular gentle exercise, getting enough rest, and eating healthy foods. Some people with myasthenia gravis go into remission. This means that they do not have symptoms. The remission is usually temporary, but sometimes it can be permanent.

The adrenal glands make important hormones that help control heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose (blood sugar), and the way the body reacts to stress. Neuroblastoma may also begin in the neck, chest or spinal cord. What causes neuroblastoma? Neuroblastoma is caused by changes in your genes . Gene changes also called gene variants or mutations. In most cases, the cause of the mutation is unknown. In some other cases, the mutation is passed from the parent to the child. What are the symptoms of neuroblastoma? Neuroblastoma often begins in early childhood . Sometimes it begins before a child is born.The most common symptoms are caused by the tumor pressing on nearby tissues as it grows or by cancer spreading to the bone.They include: A lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest Bulging eyes Dark circles around the eyes Bone pain Swollen stomach and trouble breathing in babies Painless, bluish lumps under the skin in babies Weakness or paralysis (loss of ability to move a body part) How is neuroblastoma diagnosed? To diagnose neuroblastoma, your child's health care provider will do various tests and procedures, which may include: A medical history. A neurological exam . Imaging test s, such as x-rays , a CT scan , an ultrasound , an MRI , or an MIBG scan. In an MIBG scan, a small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein. It travels through the bloodstream and attaches itself to any neuroblastoma cells. A scanner detects the cells. Blood and urine tests. Biopsy , in which a sample of tissue is removed and examined under a microscope. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, in which bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone are removed for testing. What are the treatments for neuroblastoma? The treatments for neuroblastoma include: Observation, also called watchful waiting, is where the health care provider does not give any treatments until your child's signs or symptoms appear or change. Surgery Radiation therapy . Chemotherapy . High-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell rescue. Your child will get high doses of chemotherapy and radiation. This kills the cancer cells, but it also kills healthy cells. So your child will get a stem cell transplant , usually of his or her own cells collected earlier. This helps to replace the healthy cells that were lost. Iodine 131-MIBG therapy, a treatment with radioactive iodine.

There are different acupuncture methods. The most common one involves inserting thin needles through the skin. Others include using pressure, electrical stimulation, and heat. Acupuncture is based on the belief that qi (vital energy) flows through the body along paths, called meridians. Practitioners believe that triggering the acupuncture points can rebalance the qi. Research suggests that acupuncture can help manage certain pain conditions. Biofeedback techniques use electronic devices to measure body functions such as breathing and heart rate. This teaches you to be more aware of your body functions so you can learn to control them. For example, a biofeedback device may show you measurements of your muscle tension. By watching how these measurements change, you can become more aware of when your muscles are tense and learn to relax them. Biofeedback may help to control pain, including chronic headaches and back pain. Electrical stimulation involves using a device to send a gentle electric current to your nerves or muscles. This can help treat pain by changing or blocking pain signals. Types include: Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) Implanted electric nerve stimulation Deep brain or spinal cord stimulation Massage therapy is a treatment in which the soft tissues of the body are kneaded, rubbed, tapped, and stroked. Among other benefits, it may help people relax, and relieve stress and pain. Meditation is a mind-body practice in which you focus your attention on something, such as an object, word, phrase, or breathing. This helps you to minimize distracting or stressful thoughts or feelings. Physical therapy uses techniques such as heat, cold, exercise, massage, and manipulation. It can help to control pain, condition muscles and restore strength. Psychotherapy (talk therapy) uses methods such as discussion, listening, and counseling to treat mental and behavioral disorders. It can also help people who have pain, especially chronic pain, by: Teaching them coping skills to better deal with the stress that pain can cause Addressing negative thoughts and emotions that can make pain worse Providing them with support Relaxation therapy can help reduce muscle tension and stress, lower blood pressure, and control pain. It may involve tensing and relaxing muscles throughout the body. It may be used with guided imagery (focusing the mind on positive images) and meditation. Surgery can sometimes be necessary to treat severe pain, especially when back problems or serious musculoskeletal injuries cause it. There are always risks to getting surgery, and it does not always work to treat pain. It is important to go through all the risks and benefits with your provider.",MedlinePlus

The type of vision loss and how severe it is depends on where the damage occurs. It may affect one or both eyes. There are many different types of optic nerve disorders, including: Glaucoma is a group of diseases that are the leading cause of blindness in the United States. Glaucoma usually happens when the fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly rises and damages the optic nerve. Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve. Causes include infections and immune-related illnesses such as multiple sclerosis . Sometimes the cause is unknown. Optic nerve atrophy is damage to the optic nerve. Causes include poor blood flow to the eye, disease, trauma, or exposure to toxic substances. Optic nerve head drusen are pockets of protein and calcium salts that build up in the optic nerve over time Contact your health care provider if you are having vision problems. Tests for optic nerve disorders may include eye exams, ophthalmoscopy (an examination of the back of your eye), and imaging tests . Treatment depends on which disorder that you have. With some optic nerve disorders, you may get your vision back. With others, there is no treatment, or treatment may only prevent further vision loss.",MedlinePlus
Oral Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/oralcancer.html,"What is oral cancer? Oral cancer is cancer of the mouth. It is a type of head and neck cancer . Most oral cancers are squamous cell cancers . They begin in the flat cells that cover the surfaces of your mouth, tongue, and lips. The cancer cells may spread into deeper tissue as the cancer grows. Most oral cancers are related to tobacco use, heavy alcohol use, or an HPV infection . Who is more likely to develop oral cancer? Anyone can get oral cancer, but you are more likely to develop it if you: Use tobacco or drink lots of alcohol. Your risk of developing oral cancer is even higher if you do both. Are male.

Osteoarthritis,https://medlineplus.gov/osteoarthritis.html,"What is osteoarthritis? Osteoarthritis, sometimes called OA, is a type of arthritis that only affects the joints, usually in the hands, knees, hips, neck, and lower back. It's the most common type of arthritis. In a healthy joint, the ends of the bones are covered with a smooth, slippery tissue called cartilage. The cartilage pads the bones and helps them glide easily when you move the joint. With osteoarthritis, the cartilage breaks down and becomes rough. Sometimes, all the cartilage wears away and the bones rub together. Bumps of extra bone called bone spurs may grow in the joint area. There is no cure for osteoarthritis. It usually gets worse slowly. But there's a lot you can do to manage the symptoms. What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis? Osteoarthritis affects people in different ways, and not everyone has pain. The most common symptoms are: Pain when you move, which often gets better with rest Stiffness, especially for the first 30 minutes after you get up from resting Swollen joints, especially after using the joint a lot Less movement in the joint than normal A joint that feels loose or unstable What causes osteoarthritis? Researchers aren't sure what causes osteoarthritis. They think that it could be caused by a combination of factors in the body and the environment. Your chance of developing osteoarthritis increases with age. They also know that some people are more likely to develop it than others. Who is more likely to develop osteoarthritis? Things that make you more likely to develop osteoarthritis include: Aging. Osteoarthritis can happen at any age, but the chance of getting it increases in middle-aged adults and older. After age 50, it is more common in women than in men. Being overweight. Extra weight puts more stress on your joints. Having a past injury or surgery on a joint. This is often the cause of osteoarthritis in younger adults. Doing a lot of activities that overuse the joint. This includes sports with a lot of jumping, twisting, running, or throwing. Having a joint that doesn't line up correctly. A family history of osteoarthritis. Some people inherit genetic changes that increase their chance of developing osteoarthritis. How is osteoarthritis diagnosed? There is no specific test for osteoarthritis. To find out if you have osteoarthritis, your provider: Will ask about your symptoms and medical history Will do a physical exam May use x-rays or other imaging tests to look at your joints May order lab tests to make sure that a different problem isn't causing your symptoms What are the treatments for osteoarthritis? The goal of treating osteoarthritis is to ease your pain, help you move better, and stop it from getting worse. Treatment usually begins with: Exercises to improve strength, flexibility and balance Weight loss, if needed, to improve pain, especially in your hips or knees Braces or shoe inserts (orthotics) that a health care provider fits for you You can buy some pain relievers and arthritis creams without a prescription. They can be helpful, but it's best to talk to your provider about using them. If they don't help enough, your provider may prescribe injections (shots) into the joint or prescription pain relievers. Complementary therapies may help some people. Massage can increase blood flow and bring warmth to the area. Some research shows that acupuncture may help relieve osteoarthritis pain. Simple things like heat and ice can help, too. If none of these treatments help enough, surgery may be an option. You and your provider can decide if it's right for you.

Osteogenesis Imperfecta,https://medlineplus.gov/osteogenesisimperfecta.html,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder in which bones fracture (break) easily. Sometimes the fractures happen for no known reason. OI can also cause weak muscles, brittle teeth, a curved spine, and hearing loss. OI is caused by one of several genes that aren't working properly.  When these genes don't work, it affects how you make collagen, a protein that helps make bones strong. OI can range from mild to severe, and symptoms vary from person to person. A person may have just a few or as many as several hundred fractures in a lifetime. There is no specific test for OI. Your doctor uses your medical and family history, physical exam, and imaging and lab tests to diagnose it. Your doctor may also test your collagen (from skin) or genes (from blood). There is no cure, but you can manage symptoms. Treatments include exercise, pain medicine, physical therapy, wheelchairs, braces, and surgery.

Osteonecrosis,https://medlineplus.gov/osteonecrosis.html,"Osteonecrosis is a disease caused by reduced blood flow to bones in the joints. In people with healthy bones, new bone is always replacing old bone. In osteonecrosis, the lack of blood causes the bone to break down faster than the body can make enough new bone. The bone starts to die and may break down. You can have osteonecrosis in one or several bones. It is most common in the upper leg. Other common sites are your upper arm and your knees, shoulders and ankles. The disease can affect men and women of any age, but it usually strikes in your thirties, forties or fifties. At first, you might not have any symptoms. As the disease gets worse, you will probably have joint pain that becomes more severe. You may not be able to bend or move the affected joint very well. No one is sure what causes the disease. Risk factors include : Long-term steroid treatment Alcohol misuse Joint injuries Having certain diseases, including arthritis and cancer Doctors use imaging tests and other tests to diagnose osteonecrosis. Treatments include medicines, using crutches, limiting activities that put weight on the affected joints, electrical stimulation and surgery.

Osteoporosis,https://medlineplus.gov/osteoporosis.html,"What is osteoporosis? Osteoporosis is a disease in which your bones become weak and are likely to fracture (break). The disease can develop when your bone mineral density and bone mass decrease. It can also happen if the structure and strength of your bones change. Osteoporosis is called a ""silent"" disease because it doesn't usually cause symptoms. You may not even know you have the disease until you break a bone. This could happen with any bone, but it's most common in the bones of your hip, vertebrae in the spine, and wrist. What causes osteoporosis? Your bones are made of living tissue. To keep them strong, your body breaks down old bone and replaces it with new bone. Osteoporosis develops when more bone is broken down than replaced. You lose bone mass and changes happen in the structure of your bone tissue. This can happen as you get older. Other risk factors can also lead to the development of osteoporosis or increase your chance of developing the disease. Who is more likely to develop osteoporosis? Anyone can develop osteoporosis, but you are more likely to develop it if you have one or more of risk factors: Your sex. Osteoporosis is more common in women. Your age. Your risk increases as you get older. It is most common in people over age 50. Your body size. It is more common in people who are slim and thin boned. Your race: White and Asian women are at highest risk. African American and Mexican American women have a lower risk. White men are at higher risk than African American and Mexican American men. Family history. Your risk of osteoporosis may be higher if one of your parents has osteoporosis or broke their hip. Changes to hormones . Low levels of certain hormones can increase your chance of developing osteoporosis. Diet. A diet that is low in calcium and/or vitamin D or does not include enough protein can raise your risk. Long-term use of certain medicines , such as: Corticosteroids Proton pump inhibitors (which treat GERD ) Medicines to treat epilepsy Having other medical conditions , such as: Endocrine diseases Certain digestive diseases Rheumatoid arthritis Certain types of cancer HIV Anorexia nervosa, a type of eating disorder Your lifestyle. Certain lifestyle factors can contribute to bone loss, such as: Smoking tobacco Long-term heavy alcohol use Physical inactivity or prolonged periods of bedrest What are the symptoms of osteoporosis? Osteoporosis usually doesn't cause symptoms. You may not know that you have it until you break a bone. How is osteoporosis diagnosed? Health care providers usually diagnose osteoporosis during routine screening for the disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for: Women over age 65 Women of any age who have factors that increase the chance of developing osteoporosis The Task Force does not recommend regular screening for men. To find out if you have osteoporosis, your provider: Will ask about your medical history and whether you have ever broken a bone May do a physical exam, which could include checking for: A loss of height and/or weight Changes in your posture Balance and gait (the way you walk) Your muscle strength Will likely order a bone density scan What are the treatments for osteoporosis? The goals for treating osteoporosis are to slow or stop bone loss and to prevent fractures. Your provider may recommend: A healthy, balanced diet that includes enough calcium, vitamin D, and protein Lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and limiting alcohol Regular physical activity Fall prevention to help prevent fractures Medicines, such as: Medicines that slow down bone loss Medicines that help rebuild bone In addition to managing your osteoporosis, it's important to avoid activities that may cause a fracture. These can include movements that involve: Twisting your spine, like swinging a golf club Bending forward from the waist, like sit ups and toe touches You can also help reduce the risk of breaking a bone by preventing falls. Can osteoporosis be prevented? To help keep bones strong and help prevent osteoporosis, the best thing to do is to eat a healthy diet rich in calcium and vitamin D. Getting regular physical activity, limiting alcohol, and not smoking can also help. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases",MedlinePlus
Ostomy,https://medlineplus.gov/ostomy.html,"An ostomy is surgery to create an opening (stoma) from an area inside the body to the outside. It treats certain diseases of the digestive or urinary systems. It can be permanent, when an organ must be removed.  It can be temporary, when the organ needs time to heal.  The organ could be the small intestine, colon, rectum, or bladder. With an ostomy, there must be a new way for wastes to leave the body. There are many different types of ostomy. Some examples are: Ileostomy - the bottom of the small intestine (ileum) is attached to the stoma. This bypasses the colon, rectum and anus. Colostomy - the colon is attached to the stoma.

Ovarian Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/ovariancancer.html,"What is ovarian cancer? Cancer is a disease in which abnormal cells in the body grow out of control and form a tumor. Ovarian cancer is a cancerous tumor that forms in the tissues of an ovary. The ovaries are a pair of female reproductive glands that make eggs and female hormones . What are the types of ovarian cancer? There are a few different types of ovarian cancer. The most common type is epithelial cancer. It begins in the cells that cover the ovary. There are also two related types of epithelial cancer that can spread to the ovaries: Fallopian tube cancer forms in the tissue lining a fallopian tube. The fallopian tubes are a pair of long, slender tubes on each side of the uterus. The uterus is the female reproductive organ where a fetus grows during pregnancy. Primary peritoneal cancer forms in the tissue lining the peritoneum. Your peritoneum is a tissue lining that covers the organs in the abdomen (belly). These two cancers are like ovarian cancer, and they have the same treatments. So some medical experts also consider those two types as ovarian cancer. Some other rarer types of ovarian cancer are malignant germ cell tumors and stromal tumors. What causes ovarian cancer? Ovarian cancer happens when there are changes (mutations) in the genetic material (DNA). Often, the exact cause of these genetic changes is unknown. Most ovarian cancers are caused by genetic changes that happen during your lifetime. But sometimes these genetic changes are inherited, meaning that you are born with them. Ovarian cancer that is caused by inherited genetic changes is called hereditary ovarian cancer. There are also certain genetic changes that can raise your risk of ovarian cancer, including changes called BRCA1 and BRCA2 . These two changes also raise your risk of breast and other cancers. Besides genetics, your lifestyle and the environment can affect your risk of ovarian cancer. Who is more likely to develop ovarian cancer? Certain people are more likely to develop ovarian cancer. They include those who: Have a family history of ovarian cancer in a mother, aunt, grandmother, or sister Have inherited changes in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes Have certain other genetic conditions, such as Lynch syndrome Have endometriosis Took hormone replacement therapy Are overweight or have obesity Are tall Are older, especially those who have gone through menopause Have never been pregnant What are the symptoms of ovarian cancer? Ovarian cancer may not cause early signs or symptoms. By the time you do have signs or symptoms, the cancer is often advanced. The signs and symptoms may include: Pain, swelling, or a feeling of pressure in the abdomen (belly) or pelvis Sudden or frequent urge to urinate (pee) Trouble eating or feeling full A lump in the pelvic area Gastrointestinal problems, such as gas , bloating, or constipation How is ovarian cancer diagnosed? To find out if you have ovarian cancer, your health care provider: Will ask about your medical history , including your symptoms Will ask about your family health history , including relatives who have had ovarian cancer Will do a physical exam , including a pelvic exam Will likely do imaging tests May do blood tests such as a CA-125 blood test Often the only way to know for sure that you have ovarian cancer is by having a biopsy of the tissue. A biopsy is done during surgery to remove the tumor. What are the treatments for ovarian cancer? Treatments for ovarian cancer may include: Surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible Chemotherapy Targeted therapy , which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells Your provider may suggest that you have genetic testing to look for the gene changes that raise the risk for ovarian cancer. Knowing whether you have the gene change may help your provider decide on your treatment plan. NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus
Ovarian Cysts,https://medlineplus.gov/ovariancysts.html,"The ovaries are part of the female reproductive system. They produce a woman's eggs and make female hormones . Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs in or on an ovary. They usually form during ovulation, when the ovary releases an egg. They are usually harmless and go away by themselves. Most women have them sometime during their lives. Most ovarian cysts are small and don't cause symptoms. Women may not find out that they have them until they have a pelvic exam. If there are symptoms, they may include: Pressure Bloating Swelling Pain in the lower abdomen, on the side where the cyst is If your health care provider finds a cyst, you may be able to wait to see if it gets bigger. You may need surgery if you have pain, are past menopause, or if the cyst does not go away. If a cyst bursts or causes bleeding, you should get medical help right away. Birth control pills can help prevent new cysts. Rarely, ovarian cysts can become cancerous. This risk increases as you get older.

Oxygen Therapy,https://medlineplus.gov/oxygentherapy.html,"What is oxygen? Oxygen is a gas that your body needs to work properly. Your cells need oxygen to make energy. Your lungs absorb oxygen from the air you breathe. The oxygen enters your blood from your lungs and travels to your organs and body tissues. Certain medical conditions can cause your blood oxygen levels to be too low. Low blood oxygen may make you feel short of breath , tired, and confused. It can also damage your body. Oxygen therapy can help you get more oxygen. What is oxygen therapy? Oxygen therapy is a treatment that provides you with extra oxygen to breathe in. It is also called supplemental oxygen. It is only available through a prescription from your health care provider. You may get it in the hospital, another medical setting, or at home. Some people only need it for a short period of time. Others will need long-term oxygen therapy. There are different types of devices that can give you oxygen. Some use tanks of liquid or gas oxygen. Others use an oxygen concentrator, which pulls oxygen out of the air. You will get the oxygen through a nose tube (cannula), a mask, or a tent. The extra oxygen is breathed in along with normal air. There are portable versions of the tanks and oxygen concentrators. They can make it easier for you to move around while using your therapy. Who needs oxygen therapy? You may need oxygen therapy if you have a condition that causes low blood oxygen, such as: COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Pneumonia COVID-19 A severe asthma attack Late-stage heart failure Cystic fibrosis Sleep apnea What are the risks of using oxygen therapy? Oxygen therapy is generally safe, but it can cause side effects. They include a dry or bloody nose, tiredness, and morning headaches. Oxygen poses a fire risk, so you should never smoke or use flammable materials when using oxygen. If you use oxygen tanks, make sure your tank is secured and stays upright. If it falls and cracks or the top breaks off, the tank can fly like a missile. What is hyperbaric oxygen therapy? Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a different type of oxygen therapy. It involves breathing oxygen in a pressurized chamber or tube. That allows your lungs to gather up to three times more oxygen than you would get by breathing oxygen at normal air pressure. The extra oxygen moves through your blood and to your organs and body tissues. HBOT is used to treat certain serious wounds , burns , injuries, and infections. It also treats air or gas embolisms (bubbles of air in your bloodstream), decompression sickness suffered by divers, and carbon monoxide poisoning . But some treatment centers claim that HBOT can treat almost anything, including Alzheimer's disease , autism , cancer , and Lyme disease . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not cleared or approved the use of HBOT for these conditions. There are risks to using HBOT, so always check with your provider before you try it.",MedlinePlus

Pacemakers and Implantable Defibrillators,https://medlineplus.gov/pacemakersandimplantabledefibrillators.html,"An arrhythmia is any disorder of your heart rate or rhythm. It means that your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern. Most arrhythmias result from problems in the electrical system of the heart. If your arrhythmia is serious, you may need a cardiac pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).  They are devices that are implanted in your chest or abdomen. A pacemaker helps control abnormal heart rhythms. It uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. It can speed up a slow heart rhythm, control a fast heart rhythm, and coordinate the chambers of the heart. An ICD monitors heart rhythms. If it senses dangerous rhythms, it delivers shocks. This treatment is called defibrillation. An ICD can help control life-threatening arrhythmias, especially those that can cause sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Most new ICDs can act as both a pacemaker and a defibrillator. Many ICDs also record the heart's electrical patterns when there is an abnormal heartbeat. This can help the doctor plan future treatment. Getting a pacemaker or ICD requires minor surgery. You usually need to stay in the hospital for a day or two, so your doctor can make sure that the device is working well.

Paget's Disease of Bone,https://medlineplus.gov/pagetsdiseaseofbone.html,"What is Paget's disease of bone? Paget's disease of bone is a chronic bone disorder. Normally, there is a process in which your bones break down and then regrow. In Paget's disease, this process is abnormal. There is excessive breakdown and regrowth of bone. Because the bones regrow too quickly, they are bigger and softer than normal. They may be misshapen and easily fractured (broken). Paget's usually affects just one or a few bones. What causes Paget's disease of bone? Researchers do not know for sure what causes Paget's disease. Environmental factors may play a role. In some cases, the disease runs in families, and several genes have been linked to the disease. Who is at risk for Paget's disease of bone? The disease is more common in older people and those of northern European heritage. If you have a close relative who has Paget's, you are much more likely to have it. What are the symptoms of Paget's disease of bone? Many people do not know that they have Paget's, because it often has no symptoms. When there are symptoms, they are similar to those of arthritis and other disorders. The symptoms include: Pain , which may be due to the disease or to arthritis, which can be a complication of Paget's Headaches and hearing loss , which can happen when Paget's disease affects the skull Pressure on the nerves , which can happen when Paget's disease affects the skull or spine Increased head size, bowing of a limb, or curvature of the spine. This can happen in advanced cases. Hip pain , if Paget's disease affects the pelvis or thighbone Damage to the cartilage of your joints , which may lead to arthritis Usually, Paget's disease gets worse slowly over time. It does not spread to normal bones. What other problems can Paget's disease of bone cause? Paget's disease can lead to other complications, such as: Arthritis, because the misshapen bones can cause increased pressure and more wear and tear on the joints Heart failure . In severe Paget's disease, the heart has to work harder to pump blood to affected bones. Heart failure is more likely if you also have hardening of the arteries . Kidney stones , which can happen when the excessive breakdown of the bone leads to extra calcium in the body Nervous system problems , since the bones can cause pressure on the brain, spinal cord, or nerves. There may also be reduced blood flow to the brain and spinal cord. Osteosarcoma, cancer of the bone Loose teeth, if Paget's disease affects the facial bones Vision loss , if Paget's disease in the skull affects the nerves. This is rare. How is Paget's disease of bone diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A physical exam An x-ray of the affected bones. Paget's disease is almost always diagnosed using x-rays. An alkaline phosphatase blood test A bone scan Sometimes the disease is found by accident when one of these tests is done for another reason. What are the treatments for Paget's disease of bone? To avoid complications, it is important to find and treat Paget's disease early. The treatments include: Medicines. There are several different medicines to treat Paget's disease. The most common type is bisphosphonates. They help reduce bone pain and stop or slow down the progress of the disease. Surgery is sometimes needed for certain complications of the disease. There are surgeries to Allow fractures (broken bones) to heal in a better position Replace joints such as the knee and hip when there is severe arthritis Realign a deformed bone to reduce the pain in weight-bearing joints, especially the knees Reduce pressure on a nerve, if enlargement of the skull or spine injuries effects the nervous system Diet and exercise do not treat Paget's, but they can help to keep your skeleton healthy. If you do not have kidney stones, you should make sure to get enough calcium and vitamin D through your diet and supplements. Besides keeping your skeleton healthy, exercise can prevent weight gain and maintain the mobility of your joints. Talk with your health care provider before you start a new exercise program.

Pain,https://medlineplus.gov/pain.html,"What is pain? Pain is a signal in your nervous system that something may be wrong. It is an unpleasant feeling, such as a prick, tingle, sting, burn, or ache. Each person feels pain differently, even if the reason for the pain is the same.  Pain may be sharp or dull. It may be mild or severe. Pain may come and go, or it may be constant. You may feel pain in one area of your body, such as your back , abdomen , chest , or pelvis , or you may feel it all over. Pain can help alert you that there is a problem. If you never felt pain, you might seriously hurt yourself without knowing it, or you might not realize you have a medical problem that needs treatment. Finding out what's causing your pain will help your health care provider determine the best way to manage or treat it. What are the types of pain? Patterns and types of pain are named based on how long and how often you have pain. These include: Acute pain usually happens suddenly because of a disease, injury, or inflammation (irritation, redness, and/or swelling). This type of pain is often sharp and acts as a warning that something is wrong. It usually goes away when the cause is treated or healed, though sometimes it can turn into chronic pain . Some examples of causes of acute pain include broken bones or dental issues . Chronic pain lasts for longer than three months or the time in which you should have healed.  It can affect all aspects of daily life, including your mood and relationships. Some conditions that might cause chronic pain include arthritis or back problems. Episodic pain can happen from time to time and may occur with long-term medical conditions. Some conditions that might cause episodic pain include sickle cell disease or chronic migraines . Pain may also be categorized by what is likely to be the cause of the pain. Pain may be described as nociceptive (caused by tissue damage or inflammation), neuropathic (caused by nerve damage), or nociplastic (caused by changes in how your nervous system processes pain). What causes pain? Understanding what causes pain and why people feel it differently may be difficult. Often, it's easier to find the cause of acute pain due to an injury than the cause of chronic pain, or you may have an ongoing cause of pain, such as cancer . In some cases, there is no clear cause. Environmental factors and psychological factors such as stress and beliefs about pain may affect the way you feel pain and respond to treatment. How is pain diagnosed? You are the only one who knows how your pain feels. Your provider can best measure your pain by how you report it. They may ask you: Where is the pain in your body? How long have you had the pain? How does the pain feel, such as stinging, burning, or sharp? How often do you have pain? When do you feel pain, such as in the morning, evening, or all the time? What relieves the pain? How does pain affect your daily life? Is the pain mild, moderate, or severe? To rate the pain on a scale. If the cause of your pain is unknown, your provider may also do a physical exam and order blood tests or other medical tests to help find the cause. What are the treatments for pain? Pain is not always curable, but there are many ways to manage and treat it. Treatment depends on the cause and type of pain. Treatments may include medicines, such as pain relievers . There are also non-drug treatments , such as acupuncture , physical therapy, and sometimes surgery. Depending on the cause of your pain and your symptoms, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes. These may include suggestions for: Eating a healthy diet Adding exercise Losing weight Managing stress Improving mental health NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",MedlinePlus
Pain Relievers,https://medlineplus.gov/painrelievers.html,"What are pain relievers? Pain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve headaches , sore muscles, arthritis , or other aches and pains .  There are many different pain medicines, and each with advantages and risks. Some types of pain respond better to certain medicines than others. Each person may also have a slightly different response to a pain reliever. What are the types of over-the-counter pain relievers? Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are good for many types of pain. Two types of OTC pain medicines are usually recommended for mild to moderate pain. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is used in many OTC and prescription medicines. It's often considered safer than other pain relievers. Unfortunately, it's common for people to take too much  accidentally . Be careful not to take too much each day or use more than one medicine with acetaminophen. Check with your health care provider before taking medicines containing acetaminophen for more than ten days or five days for your child. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) include aspirin, naproxen (Aleve), and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). These pain relievers are often most effective if you have pain and inflammation (swelling), such as for arthritis or menstrual cramps . If you take more than the recommended amount, NSAIDs may cause nausea , stomach pain, or ulcers. What are prescription pain relievers? If OTC pain relievers don't relieve your pain, your provider may prescribe something stronger. Many NSAIDs are also available at higher prescription doses. The most powerful pain relievers are opioids, sometimes called narcotics. They include strong prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, or morphine. Opioids are sometimes used to treat moderate to severe pain. Your provider may give you a prescription to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. Opioids are very effective, but they can sometimes have serious side effects. There is also a risk of addiction . Because of the risks, you must use them only under your provider's supervision. What are some non-drug treatments for pain? Pain relievers are just one part of a pain treatment plan. Environmental factors, stress , and beliefs about pain may affect the way you feel about pain and respond to treatment. There are many things you can do to help ease pain. Treatment depends on the cause and type of pain. It's important to check with your provider before trying any of them.

Some risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer include: Smoking Long-term diabetes Chronic pancreatitis Certain hereditary disorders Pancreatic cancer is hard to catch early. It doesn't cause symptoms right away. When you do get symptoms, they are often vague or you may not notice them. They include yellowing of the skin and eyes, pain in the abdomen and back, weight loss and fatigue. Also, because the pancreas is hidden behind other organs, health care providers cannot see or feel the tumors during routine exams. Doctors use a physical exam, blood tests, imaging tests, and a biopsy to diagnose it. Because it is often found late and it spreads quickly, pancreatic cancer can be hard to treat.  Possible treatments include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.

Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. It happens when digestive enzymes start digesting the pancreas itself. Pancreatitis can be acute or chronic. Either form is serious and can lead to complications. Acute pancreatitis occurs suddenly and usually goes away in a few days with treatment. It is often caused by gallstones .  Common symptoms are severe pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, and vomiting.   Treatment is usually a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and medicines to relieve pain. Chronic pancreatitis does not heal or improve. It gets worse over time and leads to permanent damage. The most common cause is heavy alcohol use . Other causes include cystic fibrosis and other inherited disorders, high levels of calcium or fats in the blood, some medicines, and autoimmune conditions . Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and oily stools. Treatment may also be a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, medicines to relieve pain, and nutritional support.

Panic Disorder,https://medlineplus.gov/panicdisorder.html,"What is panic disorder? Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder .  It causes repeated panic attacks, which are sudden periods of intense fear, discomfort, or a sense of losing control. These attacks happen even though there is no real danger. They often cause physical symptoms. For example, you may have a rapid or pounding heartbeat and feel like you are having a heart attack . If you have panic attacks, it doesn't mean you will develop a panic disorder. Many people only have one or two panic attacks in their lifetime and get better without treatment.

Researchers think that certain factors may play a role: Genetics - panic disorder sometimes runs in families. But no one knows for sure why some family members have it while others don't. Brain biology and chemistry. Your environment. Major stress . Who is more likely to develop panic disorder? Panic disorder is more common in women than men. It often starts in the late teens or early adulthood. Sometimes it starts when a person is under a lot of stress. People who have had trauma, especially in childhood, are more likely to develop panic disorder. What are the symptoms of panic disorder?

Parathyroid Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/parathyroiddisorders.html,"Most people have four pea-sized glands, called parathyroid glands, on the thyroid gland in the neck. Though their names are similar, the thyroid and parathyroid glands are completely different. The parathyroid glands make parathyroid hormone (PTH), which helps your body keep the right balance of calcium and phosphorous. If your parathyroid glands make too much or too little hormone, it disrupts this balance. If they secrete extra PTH, you have hyperparathyroidism, and your blood calcium rises. In many cases, a benign tumor on a parathyroid gland makes it overactive. Or, the extra hormones can come from enlarged parathyroid glands. Very rarely, the cause is cancer. If you do not have enough PTH, you have hypoparathyroidism. Your blood will have too little calcium and too much phosphorous.

Period Pain,https://medlineplus.gov/periodpain.html,"What are painful periods? Menstruation , or period, is normal vaginal bleeding that happens as part of a woman's monthly cycle. Many women have painful periods, also called dysmenorrhea. The pain is most often menstrual cramps, which are a throbbing, cramping pain in your lower abdomen. You may also have other symptoms, such as lower back pain, nausea, diarrhea, and headaches. Period pain is not the same as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). PMS causes many different symptoms, including weight gain, bloating, irritability, and fatigue. PMS often starts one to two weeks before your period starts. What causes painful periods? There are two types of dysmenorrhea: primary and secondary. Each type has different causes. Primary dysmenorrhea is the most common kind of period pain. It is period pain that is not caused by another condition. The cause is usually having too many prostaglandins, which are chemicals that your uterus makes. These chemicals make the muscles of your uterus tighten and relax, and this causes the cramps. The pain can start a day or two before your period. It normally lasts for a few days, though in some women it can last longer. You usually first start having period pain when you are younger, just after you begin getting periods. Often, as you get older, you have less pain. The pain may also get better after you have given birth. Secondary dysmenorrhea often starts later in life. It is caused by conditions that affect your uterus or other reproductive organs, such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids . This kind of pain often gets worse over time. It may begin before your period starts and continue after your period ends. What can I do about period pain? To help ease your period pain, you can try: Using a heating pad or hot water bottle on your lower abdomen Getting some exercise Taking a hot bath Doing relaxation techniques, including yoga and meditation You might also try taking over-the-counter pain relievers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs include ibuprofen and naproxen. Besides relieving pain, NSAIDs reduce the amount of prostaglandins that your uterus makes and lessen their effects.  This helps to lessen the cramps. You can take NSAIDs when you first have symptoms, or when your period starts. You can keep taking them for a few days. You should not take NSAIDS if you have ulcers or other stomach problems, bleeding problems, or liver disease. You should also not take them if you are allergic to aspirin. Always check with your health care provider if you are not sure whether or not you should take NSAIDs. It may also help to get enough rest and avoid using alcohol and tobacco. When should I get medical help for my period pain? For many women, some pain during your period is normal. However, you should contact your health care provider if: NSAIDs and self-care measures don't help, and the pain interferes with your life Your cramps suddenly get worse You are over 25 and you get severe cramps for the first time You have a fever with your period pain You have the pain even when you are not getting your period How is the cause of severe period pain diagnosed? To diagnose severe period pain, your health care provider will ask you about your medical history and do a pelvic exam. You may also have an ultrasound or other imaging test . If your health care provider thinks you have secondary dysmenorrhea, you might have laparoscopy . It is a surgery that that lets your health care provider look inside your body. What are treatments for severe period pain? If your period pain is primary dysmenorrhea and you need medical treatment, your health care provider might suggest using hormonal birth control, such as the pill, patch, ring, or IUD.

Peripheral Nerve Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/peripheralnervedisorders.html,"What are peripheral nerves? Nerves are like wires that carry messages back and forth between your brain and your body. Your peripheral nerves branch off from your brain and spinal cord and connect to all parts of your body, including your muscles and organs. Peripheral nerves carry messages from your brain that control your movement, breathing, heartbeat, digestion, and more. They also carry messages from your body to your brain, so you can feel things, such as pain, heat, and cold. What are peripheral nerve disorders? Peripheral nerve disorders happen when one or more peripheral nerves are damaged. Damaged nerves may not carry messages correctly, or they may not work at all. As a result, you may have pain , trouble walking , or a variety of other problems, depending on which nerves are involved. Peripheral nerve disorders are very common. There are more than 100 different types. What causes peripheral nerve disorders? Many things can damage nerves and lead to peripheral nerve disorders: Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral nerve disorders. Most people with diabetes will develop diabetic nerve problems . Physical injury ( trauma ) that stretches, crushes, squeezes, cuts, or puts pressure on one or more nerves. Some examples of peripheral nerve disorders from physical injury include complex regional pain syndrome and brachial plexus injuries . Health conditions , including: Certain cancers and their treatment ( chemotherapy and radiation therapy ). Infections , such as HIV and Lyme disease . Problems with blood or blood vessels . Autoimmune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus . Kidney or liver disease . Certain medicines. Contact with certain toxic substances , such as lead or mercury . Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and smoking . Vitamin imbalances , especially a lack of vitamin B12 . Your genes , including changes in your genes or conditions that you inherit from your parents, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease . In certain cases, the cause of peripheral nerve disorder is not known. What are the symptoms of peripheral nerve disorders? The symptoms of peripheral nerve disorders depend on which nerves are affected, what is causing the damage, and how serious it is: Types of nerves Possible symptoms of nerve damage Motor nerves control your muscles and all your movement, such as walking, talking, and using your hands. Weak or aching muscles Problems with balance, walking, or using your arms and hands Cramps or twitching muscles Muscle shrinking Sensory nerves carry messages to your brain from your senses, including touch, hot and cold, and pain. Tingling, numbness, or pain often in the hands and feet Not being able to feel heat, cold, or pain, such as a cut on your foot Pain from even light touch Autonomic nerves send messages to your organs to control breathing, digestion, and other body functions that happen without thinking about them. A heartbeat that's too fast or too slow Trouble swallowing Sweating too much or too little Vomiting , diarrhea , or constipation Problems with urination or sexual function Symptoms may range from mild to very strong. They may develop quickly over days or slowly over months and years. But they are rarely life-threatening. How are peripheral nerve disorders diagnosed? To find out if you have a peripheral nerve disorder, your provider will: Ask about your medical history Ask about your family health history Do a physical exam Order tests, which may include: Blood tests Genetic tests Nerve tests that measure: Electrical activity in your nerves and muscles How well your autonomic nerves are working A biopsy of nerve or skin tissue CT or MRI scan to see what may be pressing on your nerves What are the treatments for peripheral nerve disorders? It's important to treat any conditions that are causing nerve damage. In certain cases, that will allow your nerves to heal over time. Treatment for symptoms depends on the type of peripheral nerve disorder you have, where it is, and how severe. Treatment options include: Braces or splints Over-the-counter patches and skin creams Prescription medicines Non-drug pain management , such as electrical stimulation or relaxation therapy Surgery to relieve pressure on a nerve Can peripheral nerve disorders be prevented?

What are the symptoms of personality disorders? The symptoms of each personality disorder are different. But each disorder involves problems and uncertainty with how people see themselves. The disorders also cause problems in relationships with other people. People with personality disorders may have trouble realizing that they have a problem. To them, their thoughts are normal. They may see others as the problem. So they may not seek help when they need it. Or, if they seek help, it may be because of another reason. They may be looking for help because of other mental health symptoms or problems with relationships and work. Sometimes someone else, such as a family member or social agency, may ask them to get help. How are personality disorders diagnosed? A mental health care provider can diagnose personality disorders. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems. To make a diagnosis, the provider will consider the person's symptoms, experiences, and family medical history. A thorough medical exam may also be done to help rule out other possible causes of the symptoms. How are personality disorders treated?

Your platelets will clot (clump together) to plug the hole in the blood vessel and stop the bleeding. You can have different problems with your platelets: If your blood has a low number of platelets , it is called thrombocytopenia. This can put you at risk for mild to serious bleeding . The bleeding could be external or internal. There can be various causes. If the problem is mild, you may not need treatment. For more serious cases, you may need medicines or blood or platelet transfusions . If your blood has too many platelets , you may have a higher risk of blood clots . When the cause is unknown, this is called thrombocythemia. It is rare. You may not need treatment if there are no signs or symptoms. In other cases, people who have it may need treatment with medicines or procedures. If another disease or condition is causing the high platelet count, it is thrombocytosis. The treatment and outlook for thrombocytosis depends on what is causing it. Another possible problem is that your platelets do not work as they should .

Pneumonia can range from mild to severe, depending on what caused it, your age, and your overall health. What causes pneumonia? Bacterial , viral , and fungal infections can cause pneumonia. Bacteria are the most common cause. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own. It can also develop after you've had certain viral infections such as a cold or the flu . Several different types of bacteria can cause pneumonia, including: Streptococcus pneumoniae Legionella pneumophila ; this type of pneumonia is often called Legionnaires' disease Mycoplasma pneumoniae Chlamydia pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) Viruses that infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. Viral pneumonia is often mild and goes away on its own within a few weeks. But sometimes it is serious enough that you need to get treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you are at risk of also getting bacterial pneumonia. The different viruses that can cause pneumonia include: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Some common cold and flu viruses SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 Fungal pneumonia is more common in people who have chronic health problems or weakened immune systems . Some of the types include: Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) Valley fever (Coccidioidomycosis) Histoplasmosis Cryptococcal pneumonia Aspiration can also cause pneumonia. It can happen when you aspirate (accidentally breathe in) food or fluid into the lungs. If you are not able to cough out the food or fluid, it may cause an infection. Who is more likely to develop pneumonia? Anyone can develop pneumonia, but certain factors can increase your risk: Age; the risk is higher for children who are age 2 and under and adults age 65 and older. Exposure to certain chemicals, pollutants, or toxic fumes. Lifestyle habits, such as smoking , heavy alcohol use , and malnourishment . Being in a hospital, especially if you are in the ICU . Being sedated and/or on a ventilator raises the risk even more. Having a lung disease . Having a weakened immune system. Have trouble coughing or swallowing , from a stroke or other condition. Recently having been sick with a cold or the flu. Other chronic (long-lasting) health conditions, including diabetes , heart failure , sickle cell disease , liver disease , and kidney disease .

The symptoms of pneumonia can range from mild to severe and include: Fever Chills Cough, usually with phlegm (a type of thick mucus made in your lungs) Shortness of breath Chest pain when you breathe or cough Nausea and/or vomiting Diarrhea The symptoms can vary for different groups. Newborns and infants may not show any signs of the infection. Others may vomit and have a fever and cough. They might seem sick, with no energy, or be restless. Older adults and people who have serious illnesses or weak immune systems may have fewer and milder symptoms. They may even have a lower-than-normal temperature. Older adults who have pneumonia sometimes may feel weak or suddenly get confused. What other problems can pneumonia cause? Sometimes pneumonia can cause serious complications such as: Bacteremia, which happens when the bacteria move into the bloodstream. It is serious and can lead to septic shock . Lung abscesses , which are collections of pus in cavities of the lungs. Pleural disorders , which are conditions that affect the pleura. The pleura is the tissue that covers the outside of the lungs and lines the inside of your chest cavity. Kidney failure . Respiratory failure . How is pneumonia diagnosed? Sometimes pneumonia can be hard to diagnose. This is because it can cause some of the same symptoms as a cold or the flu. It may take time for you to realize that you have a more serious condition. To find out if you have pneumonia, your health care provider: Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms Will do a physical exam, which includes listening to your lungs with a stethoscope May order various tests, such as: A chest x-ray Blood tests such as a complete blood count (CBC) to see if your immune system is actively fighting an infection A blood culture to find out whether you have a bacterial infection that has spread to your bloodstream If you are in the hospital, have serious symptoms, are older, or have other health problems, you may also have more tests, such as: Sputum test , which checks for bacteria in a sample of your sputum (mucus that is brought up from the lungs by coughing). Chest CT scan to see how much of your lungs are affected. It may also show if you have complications such as lung abscesses or pleural effusions (a buildup of fluid in the pleural space). Pleural fluid culture , which checks for bacteria in a fluid sample that was taken from the pleural space. Pulse oximetry or blood oxygen level test, to check how much oxygen is in your blood. Bronchoscopy, a procedure used to look inside your lungs' airways. What are the treatments for pneumonia? Treatment for pneumonia depends on the type of pneumonia, which germ is causing it, and how severe it is: Antibiotics treat bacterial pneumonia and some types of fungal pneumonia. They do not work for viral pneumonia. In some cases, your provider may prescribe antiviral medicines for viral pneumonia. Antifungal medicines treat other types of fungal pneumonia. You may need to be treated in a hospital if your symptoms are severe or if you are at risk for complications. While there, you may get additional treatments. For example, if your blood oxygen level is low, you may receive oxygen therapy . It may take time to recover from pneumonia. Some people feel better within a week. For other people, it can take a month or more. Can pneumonia be prevented? Vaccines can help prevent pneumonia caused by pneumococcal bacteria or the flu virus .

The paralysis may be lifelong and can sometimes be life-threatening. Because of vaccines, polio is rare in the United States. But polio does occur in some parts of the world, and travelers can spread the virus. How does polio spread? The poliovirus is very contagious. It spreads through contact with: The stool (poop) of person who has the infection Droplets from a sneeze or cough of someone who has the infection This contact can happen if: You get contaminated stool or droplets on your hands and then touch your mouth A child puts contaminated toys or other objects into their mouth You share food or utensils with someone who has the infection People who have the infection can spread it to others just before and up to several weeks after the symptoms appear. People who don't have symptoms can still spread the virus to others and make them sick. Who is more likely to develop polio? Polio mainly affects children under age 5. But people of any age (including adults) who are unvaccinated are at risk of developing polio. People who live in or travel to areas where there is polio are more likely to get polio. What are the symptoms of polio? Most people who get infected with poliovirus do not have any symptoms. But one out of four people who get polio will have flu-like symptoms. These symptoms usually last 2 to 5 days, and they include: Sore throat Fever Fatigue Nausea Headache Stomach pain In rare cases, polio can be very serious. It can lead to: Meningitis , an infection of the covering of your spinal cord and/or brain. Weakness or paralysis in your arms, legs, or both. This paralysis or weakness can last a lifetime. It is possible for the paralysis to become life-threatening if it affects the muscles that you use to breathe. Post-polio syndrome (PPS), which happens later in life. What is post-polio syndrome (PPS)? Post-polio syndrome (PPS) is a condition that affects polio survivors many years after they recovered from polio. It usually happens 15-40 years later. It is not contagious. People who get PPS start having new weakening in muscles that were previously affected by the polio infection.  Symptoms may range from mild to serious. The symptoms of PPS include: Muscle weakness Muscle atrophy (wasting away of muscles) Loss of muscle function Mental and physical fatigue Joint pain Curving of the spine ( scoliosis ) PPS is rarely life-threatening, but the symptoms can interfere with your daily life. How is polio diagnosed? If you think you or someone in your family has symptoms of polio, call your healthcare provider right away or go to an emergency room. To find out if you or your child has polio, the provider: Will do a physical exam. Will take a detailed medical history, including your vaccination history and history of any recent travel. Will collect samples of body fluids, such as stool, saliva, blood, urine, and spinal fluid. Poliovirus is most likely to be detected in stool specimens. May do an MRI to look at pictures of the spinal cord. What are the treatments for polio and post-polio syndrome (PPS)? There is no cure or specific treatment for polio. For a mild case, getting rest and drinking plenty of liquids may help with some of the symptoms. If the polio is more serious, you or your child may need: Physical or occupational therapy to help with arm or leg weakness. The earlier therapy is started, the better. Pain relievers to help with pain and treat fever. If your child is sick, do not give them aspirin unless their provider tells you to. A ventilator to help with breathing if the breathing muscles are weak or paralyzed. There is no cure for PPS. Treatments may help you manage your symptoms. They include: Non-fatiguing exercises (exercises that do not cause pain or fatigue that lasts more than 10 minutes). These exercises may improve muscle strength and reduce tiredness. Your provider can help you figure out which exercises are best for you. Mobility aids . Ventilation equipment. Lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, and not smoking. Can polio be prevented? There are two types of vaccine that can prevent polio: Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) given as an injection in the leg or arm, depending on how old you are. Since 2000, this has been the only polio vaccine used in the United States. Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is given as drops in the mouth. It is still used throughout much of the world. Children in the United States get four doses of PV as part of their routine childhood immunizations . Most adults in the United States were vaccinated against polio as children. There is a one-time IPV booster. It may be given to adults who have completed their polio vaccinations but are at higher risk of contact with poliovirus. You may be at higher risk if you are: Traveling to a country where the risk of getting polio is greater Working in a laboratory or healthcare setting and handling samples that might contain polioviruses A healthcare worker who has contact with patients who could have polio Another way to help prevent the spread of polio is to wash your hands often with soap and water. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers will not kill poliovirus. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/polycysticovarysyndrome.html,"What is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?

Obesity , weight gain, or trouble losing weight. Severe acne which may be hard to treat. Oily skin. Patches of thickened dark skin (called acanthosis nigricans). Infertility . PCOS is one of the most common causes of infertility. But many women with PCOS can still get pregnant. What other health problems are linked to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? PCOS is linked to many other health problems, including: Insulin resistance, which can lead to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes . Heart disease . Having PCOS increases your risk, and this risk goes up as you age. High blood pressure . High LDL (""bad"") cholesterol and low HDL (""good"") cholesterol . This increases your risk of heart disease . Sleep apnea , a disorder that causes you to repeatedly stop breathing during sleep. Depression and anxiety .

Porphyria,https://medlineplus.gov/porphyria.html,"Porphyrias are a group of genetic disorders caused by problems with how your body makes a substance called heme. Heme is found throughout the body, especially in your blood and bone marrow, where it carries oxygen. There are two main types of porphyrias. One affects the skin and the other affects the nervous system. People with the skin type develop blisters, itching, and swelling of their skin when it is exposed to sunlight. The nervous system type is called acute porphyria. Symptoms include pain in the chest, abdomen, limbs, or back; muscle numbness, tingling, paralysis, or cramping; vomiting; constipation; and personality changes or mental disorders. These symptoms come and go. Certain triggers can cause an attack, including some medicines, smoking, drinking alcohol, infections, stress, and sun exposure. Attacks develop over hours or days. They can last for days or weeks. Porphyria can be hard to diagnose. It requires blood, urine, and stool tests. Each type of porphyria is treated differently. Treatment may involve avoiding triggers, receiving heme through a vein, taking medicines to relieve symptoms, or having blood drawn to reduce iron in the body.

Pregnancy and Nutrition,https://medlineplus.gov/pregnancyandnutrition.html,"What is nutrition, and why is it important during pregnancy? Nutrition is about eating a healthy and balanced diet so your body gets the nutrients that it needs. Nutrients are substances in foods that our bodies need so they can function and grow. They include carbohydrates , fats , proteins , vitamins , minerals , and water. When you're pregnant , nutrition is more important than ever. You need more of many important nutrients than you did before pregnancy. Making healthy food choices every day will help you give your baby what they need to develop . It will also help make sure that you and your baby gain a healthy amount of weight. Do I have any special nutritional needs now that I am pregnant? You need more folic acid, iron, calcium, and vitamin D than you did before pregnancy: Folic acid is a B vitamin that may help prevent neural tube defects . Before pregnancy, you need 400 mcg (micrograms) per day. During pregnancy and when breastfeeding, you need 600 mcg per day from foods and/or vitamins. It is hard to get this amount from foods alone, so you will most likely need to take a supplement that contains folic acid. Iron is important for your baby's growth and brain development. During pregnancy, the amount of blood in your body increases, so you need more iron for yourself and your growing baby. You should get 27 mg (milligrams) of iron a day. Calcium during pregnancy can reduce your risk of preeclampsia . It's a serious medical condition that causes a sudden increase in your blood pressure. Calcium also builds up your baby's bones and teeth. Pregnant adults should get 1,000 mg (milligrams) of calcium a day Pregnant teenagers (ages 14-18) need 1,300 mg of calcium a day Vitamin D helps the calcium to build your baby's bones and teeth. All women, pregnant or not, should be getting 600 IU (international units) of vitamin D per day. Keep in mind that taking too much of a supplement can be harmful. For example, very high levels of vitamin A can cause birth defects . Only take vitamins and mineral supplements that your health care provider recommends. You also need more protein when you are pregnant. Healthy sources of protein include beans, peas, eggs, lean meats, seafood, and unsalted nuts and seeds. Getting enough fluids is another special nutritional concern during pregnancy. When you are pregnant, your body needs even more water to stay hydrated and support the life inside you. So it's important to drink enough fluids every day. How much weight should I gain during my pregnancy? How much weight you should gain depends on your health and how much you weighed before pregnancy: If you were at a normal weight before pregnancy, you should gain about 25 to 35 pounds If you were underweight before pregnancy, you should gain more If you were overweight or had obesity before you became pregnant, you should gain less Check with your provider to find out how much weight gain during pregnancy is healthy for you. You should gain the weight gradually during your pregnancy, with most of the weight gained in the last trimester. Do I need to eat more calories when I am pregnant? How many calories you need depends on your weight gain goals. Your provider can tell you what your goal should be, based on things like your weight before pregnancy, your age, and how fast you gain weight. The general recommendations are: In the first trimester of pregnancy, you probably do not need extra calories In the second trimester, you usually need about 340 extra calories In the last trimester, you may need around 450 extra calories per day During the final weeks of pregnancy, you may not need extra calories Keep in mind that not all calories are equal. You should eat healthy foods that are packed with nutrients - not ""empty calories"" such as those found in soft drinks, candies, and desserts. What foods should I avoid during pregnancy? During pregnancy, you should avoid: Alcohol. There is no known amount of alcohol that is safe for a woman to drink during pregnancy . Fish that may have high levels of mercury.

Foods that are more likely to contain germs that could cause foodborne illness , including Refrigerated smoked seafood like whitefish, salmon, and mackerel Undercooked meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood Refrigerated meat spreads Store-made salads, such as chicken, egg, or tuna salad Unpasteurized or raw milk Unpasteurized juices or cider Unpasteurized soft cheeses, such as unpasteurized feta, Brie, queso blanco, queso fresco, and blue cheeses Raw sprouts of any kind (including alfalfa, clover, radish, and mung bean) Raw cookie dough Unwashed fruits and vegetables Too much caffeine . Drinking high amounts of caffeine may be harmful for your baby. For most people, it's best to limit caffeine to less than 200 mg per day during pregnancy. But first check with your provider about whether you should have caffeine at all.",MedlinePlus
Pregnancy and Opioids,https://medlineplus.gov/pregnancyandopioids.html,"You may need to take medicines while you are pregnant . But not all medicines are safe during pregnancy. Many medicines carry risks for you, your baby, or both. Opioids, especially when misused, can cause problems for you and your baby while you are pregnant. What are opioids? Opioids, sometimes called narcotics, are a type of drug. They include strong prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. A health care provider may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some providers prescribe them for chronic pain . Prescription opioids used for pain relief are generally safe when taken for a short time and as prescribed by your provider. However, people who take opioids are at risk for opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose . These risks increase when these medicines are misused. Misuse can include taking your opioid medicines in greater amounts or more often than you are supposed to, using them to get high, or taking someone else's opioids. What are the risks of taking opioids during pregnancy? Taking opioids during pregnancy can cause problems for you and your baby. The possible risks include: Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) - withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, seizures, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and poor feeding in newborns Neural tube defects - birth defects of the brain, spine, or spinal cord Congenital heart defects - problems with the structure of the baby's heart Gastroschisis - a birth defect of the baby's abdomen, where the intestines stick outside of the body through a hole beside the belly button Loss of the baby, either miscarriage (before 20 weeks of pregnancy) or stillbirth (after 20 or more weeks) Preterm delivery - a birth before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy Stunted growth, leading to low birthweight Problems with the placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby) If your provider suggests that you take opioids during pregnancy, you should first discuss the risks and benefits. Then if you both decide that you need to take the opioids, you should work together to try to minimize the risks. Some of the ways to do this include: Taking them for the shortest time possible Taking the lowest dose that will help you Carefully following your provider's instructions for taking the medicines Contacting your provider if you have side effects Going to all your follow-up appointments If I am already taking opioids and I become pregnant, what should I do? If you have been taking opioids and you become pregnant, contact your provider. But don't stop taking the opioids on your own. If you suddenly stop taking opioids, it could cause severe health problems for you or your baby. In some cases, stopping suddenly during pregnancy may be more harmful than taking the medicines. Can I breastfeed while taking opioids? If you regularly take opioid medicines, you may be able to breastfeed. It depends on which medicine you are taking. But you should not breastfeed if you have HIV or take illegal drugs . Check with your provider before breastfeeding. What is the treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) in pregnancy? If you are pregnant and have an opioid use disorder, do not stop taking opioids suddenly. Instead, see your provider so you can get help. The treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is called medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). For MOUD during pregnancy, providers prescribe either buprenorphine or methadone. These medicines can reduce your cravings and help prevent withdrawal. Counseling, including behavioral therapies, can also help you to change your attitudes and behaviors related to drug use and build healthy life skills.",MedlinePlus
Pregnancy and Substance Use,https://medlineplus.gov/pregnancyandsubstanceuse.html,"During pregnancy , there are many things you can do to keep yourself and your baby healthy. They include getting regular prenatal care , eating healthy , and staying active. But it's also very important to avoid substances that could be harmful to you and your baby, such as tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. Tobacco Smoking during pregnancy passes nicotine, carbon monoxide , and many other harmful chemicals to your baby. Nicotine is not only a health danger for you, but it can also damage your developing baby's brain and lungs. Carbon monoxide can keep the developing baby from getting enough oxygen. If you smoke while pregnant, it raises the risk of your baby being born too small , too early , or with birth defects . During the first year of life, there is a higher risk of your baby dying from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). And later in life, your child may be more likely to have health problems, such as asthma and obesity . Other tobacco products, including e-cigarettes , also contain nicotine and are not safe to use during pregnancy. And some of the flavorings used in e-cigarettes may be harmful to developing babies. You will also want to try to avoid secondhand smoke , which has some of the same risks as smoking during pregnancy. Alcohol There is no known amount of alcohol that is safe for you to drink during pregnancy and while trying to get pregnant. All types of alcohol are equally harmful, including all wines and beer. The risks from drinking during pregnancy include problems with the growth of the developing baby and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). FASD is a life-long condition that can cause a mix of physical, behavioral, and learning problems. Illegal drugs Using illegal drugs, such as cocaine , methamphetamines , and club drugs , during pregnancy can cause problems for both you and your baby. They may cause low birth weight babies, birth defects, or miscarriage . Your child may be more likely to have learning and developmental disabilities. And if you are injecting the drugs, that puts you at risk for HIV . HIV can be passed along to your baby during pregnancy . Prescription drug misuse Misusing prescription drugs can also be harmful. Misuse can include taking more than your prescribed dose or taking it more often, using it to get high, or taking someone else's medicines. The possible effects of misusing a medicine during pregnancy will depend on which medicine you are misusing. Opioids One type of drug that is a concern during pregnancy is opioids . Opioids include strong prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. Taking opioids during pregnancy can cause problems for you and your baby. The risks include birth defects, preterm birth, the loss of the baby, and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS causes withdrawal symptoms in newborn babies. If you have pain and your health care provider suggests that you take prescription opioids during pregnancy, first discuss the risks and benefits with the provider. Then if you both decide that you need to take the opioids, you can work together to try to minimize the risks. Cannabis (marijuana) Cannabis (marijuana) is another drug that could be harmful to your baby. Some research shows that using cannabis during pregnancy is linked to developmental problems in children and teens. More research is needed, but the safest thing to do is stop using it if you are pregnant. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that people should not use cannabis while they are pregnant. Getting help If you are pregnant and using any of these substances, contact your provider. Together you and your provider can find the right treatment to help you quit. If you are taking opioids or are addicted to drugs, don't stop taking them suddenly. That can be dangerous to you and the baby. Instead, contact your provider for help with getting off the drugs safely.",MedlinePlus
Premature Babies,https://medlineplus.gov/prematurebabies.html,"Almost 1 of every 10 infants born in the United States are premature, or preemies. A premature birth is when a baby is born before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. A full-term pregnancy is 40 weeks. Important growth and development happen throughout pregnancy - especially in the final months and weeks. Because they are born too early, preemies weigh much less than full-term babies. They may have health problems because their organs did not have enough time to develop. Problems that a baby born too early may have include: Breathing problems Feeding difficulties Cerebral palsy Developmental delay Vision problems Hearing problems Preemies need special medical care in a neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe type of PMS. With PMDD, the symptoms are severe enough to interfere with your life.  PMDD much less common than PMS. What causes premenstrual syndrome (PMS)? Researchers don't know exactly what causes PMS. Changes in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle may play a role. These changing hormone levels may affect some women more than others. What are the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS)? PMS symptoms are different for everyone. You may get physical symptoms, emotional symptoms, or both. Your symptoms may also change throughout your life. Physical symptoms may include: Breast swelling and tenderness Acne Bloating and weight gain Headache Joint pain Backache Constipation or diarrhea Food cravings Emotional symptoms may include: Irritability Mood swings Crying spells Depression Anxiety Sleeping too much or too little Trouble with concentration and memory Less interest in sex How is premenstrual syndrome (PMS) diagnosed? You may wish to see your health care provider if your symptoms bother you or affect your daily life. There is no single test for PMS.

To be diagnosed with PMS, your symptoms must: Happen in the five days before your period for at least three menstrual cycles in a row End within four days after your period starts Keep you from enjoying or doing some of your normal activities Your provider may wish to do tests to rule out other conditions which may cause similar symptoms. What are the treatments for premenstrual syndrome (PMS)? No single PMS treatment works for everyone. If your symptoms are not severe, you may be able to manage them with: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen, to help ease cramps, headaches, backaches, and breast tenderness Getting regular exercise Getting enough sleep Eating healthy foods Avoiding salt , caffeine , sugar, and alcohol in the two weeks before your period Some studies have shown that certain vitamins may help with some symptoms of PMS. They include calcium and vitamin B6 . Some women take certain herbal supplements for PMS symptoms. But there is not enough evidence to prove that supplements are effective for PMS. Check with your provider before taking any vitamins or supplements. If you are not able to manage your PMS symptoms, your provider may suggest prescription medicines. These medicines may also be used to treat PMDD. They include: Hormonal birth control , which may help with the physical symptoms of PMS. But sometimes they may make the emotional symptoms worse. You may need to try several different types of birth control before you find the right one. Antidepressants , such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which may help with emotional symptoms. Diuretics (""water pills"") to reduce symptoms of bloating and breast tenderness.

At your first prenatal visit , your health care provider will test for a number of things, including problems with your blood, signs of infections , and whether you are immune to rubella (German measles) and chickenpox . Throughout your pregnancy, your health care provider may suggest a number of other tests, too. Some tests are suggested for all women, such as screenings for gestational diabetes , Down syndrome , and HIV . Other tests might be offered based on your: Age Personal or family medical history Ethnic background Results of routine tests There are two types of tests: Screening tests are tests that are done to see if you or your baby might have certain problems. They evaluate risk, but do not diagnose problems. If your screening test result is abnormal, it does not mean that there is a problem. It means that more information is needed.

Primary Ovarian Insufficiency,https://medlineplus.gov/primaryovarianinsufficiency.html,"What is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)? Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as premature ovarian failure, happens when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40. Many women naturally experience reduced fertility when they are about 40 years old. They may start getting irregular menstrual periods as they transition to menopause. For women with POI, irregular periods and reduced fertility start before the age of 40. Sometimes it can start as early as the teenage years. POI is different from premature menopause . With premature menopause, your periods stop before age 40. You can no longer get pregnant. The cause can be natural or it can be a disease, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. With POI, some women still have occasional periods. They may even get pregnant.  In most cases of POI, the cause is unknown. What causes primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)? In about 90% of cases, the exact cause of POI is unknown. Research shows that POI is related to problems with the follicles. Follicles are small sacs in your ovaries. Your eggs grow and mature inside them. One type of follicle problem is that you run out of working follicles earlier than normal. Another is that the follicles are not working properly. In most cases, the cause of the follicle problem is unknown. But sometimes the cause may be: Genetic disorders such as Fragile X syndrome and Turner syndrome A low number of follicles Autoimmune diseases, including thyroiditis and Addison disease Chemotherapy or radiation therapy Metabolic disorders Toxins, such as cigarette smoke , chemicals, and pesticides Who is at risk for primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)? Certain factors can raise a woman's risk of POI: Family history. Women who have a mother or sister with POI are more likely to have it. Genes. Some changes to genes and genetic conditions put women at higher risk for POI. For example, women Fragile X syndrome or Turner syndrome are at higher risk. Certain diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and viral infections Cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy Age. Younger women can get POI, but it becomes more common between the ages of 35-40. What are the symptoms of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)? The first sign of POI is usually irregular or missed periods. Later symptoms may be similar to those of natural menopause: Hot flashes Night sweats Irritability Poor concentration Decreased sex drive Pain during sex Vaginal dryness For many women with POI, trouble getting pregnant or infertility is the reason they go to their health care provider. What other problems can primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) cause? Since POI causes you to have lower levels of certain hormones, you are at greater risk for other health conditions, including: Anxiety and depression. Hormonal changes caused by POI can contribute to anxiety or lead to depression . Dry eye syndrome and eye surface disease. Some women with POI have one of these eye conditions. Both can cause discomfort and may lead to blurred vision. If not treated, these conditions can cause permanent eye damage. Heart disease. Lower levels of estrogen can affect the muscles lining the arteries and can increase the buildup of cholesterol in the arteries. These factors increase your risk of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Infertility. Low thyroid function. This problem also is called hypothyroidism . The thyroid is a gland that makes hormones that control your body's metabolism and energy level. Low levels of thyroid hormones can affect your metabolism and can cause very low energy, mental sluggishness, and other symptoms. Osteoporosis. The hormone estrogen helps keep bones strong. Without enough estrogen, women with POI often develop osteoporosis . It is a bone disease that causes weak, brittle bones that are more likely to break . How is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) diagnosed? To diagnose POI, your health care provider may do: A medical history, including asking whether you have relatives with POI A pregnancy test, to make sure that you are not pregnant A physical exam, to look for signs of other disorders that could be causing your symptoms Blood tests, to check for certain hormone levels. You may also have a blood test to do a chromosome analysis. A chromosome is the part of a cell that contains genetic information. A pelvic ultrasound, to see whether or not the ovaries are enlarged or have multiple follicles How is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) treated? Currently, there is no proven treatment to restore normal function to a woman's ovaries.  But there are treatments for some of the symptoms of POI. There are also ways to lower your health risks and treat the conditions that POI can cause: Hormone replacement therapy (HRT). HRT is the most common treatment. It gives your body the estrogen and other hormones that your ovaries are not making. HRT improves sexual health and decreases the risks for heart disease and osteoporosis. You usually take it until about age 50; that's about the age when menopause usually begins. Calcium and vitamin D supplements. Because women with POI are at higher risk for osteoporosis, you should take calcium and vitamin D every day. In vitro fertilization (IVF). If you have POI and you wish to become pregnant, you may consider trying IVF . Regular physical activity and a healthy body weight. Getting regular exercise and controlling your weight can lower your risk for osteoporosis and heart disease. Treatments for associated conditions. If you have a condition that is related to POI, it is important to treat that as well. Treatments may involve medicines and hormones.

Progressive Supranuclear Palsy,https://medlineplus.gov/progressivesupranuclearpalsy.html,"What is progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)? Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare brain disease . It happens because of damage to nerve cells in the brain. PSP affects your movement , including control of your walking and balance . It also affects your thinking and eye movement . PSP is progressive, which means that it gets worse over time. What causes progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)? The cause of PSP is unknown. In rare cases, the cause is a mutation in a certain gene. One sign of PSP is abnormal clumps of tau in nerve cells in the brain. Tau is a protein in your nervous system, including in nerve cells. Some other diseases also cause a buildup of tau in the brain, including Alzheimer's disease . Who is at risk for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)? PSP usually affects people over 60, but in some cases it can start earlier. It is more common in men. What are the symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)? Symptoms are very different in each person, but they may include: A loss of balance while walking. This is often the first symptom. Speech problems Trouble swallowing A blurring of vision and problems controlling eye movement Changes in mood and behavior, including depression and apathy (a loss of interest and enthusiasm) Mild dementia How is progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) diagnosed? There is no specific test for PSP. It can be difficult to diagnose, because the symptoms are similar to other diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will take your medical history and do physical and neurological exams. You may have an MRI or other imaging tests. What are the treatments for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)? There is currently no effective treatment for PSP. Medicines may reduce some symptoms. Some non-drug treatments, such as walking aids and special glasses, may also help. People with severe swallowing problems may need gastrostomy. This is a surgery to insert a feeding tube into the stomach. PSP gets worse over time. Many people become severely disabled within three to five years after getting it. PSP isn't life-threatening on its own. It can still be dangerous because it increases your risk of pneumonia , choking from swallowing problems, and injuries from falling . But with good attention to medical and nutritional needs, many people with PSP can live 10 or more years after the first symptoms of the disease.

Prostate Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/prostatecancer.html,"What is prostate cancer? Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. Prostate cancer begins in the cells of the prostate. The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder. It makes fluid that is part of semen. Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. It often grows very slowly. If it does not spread to other parts of the body, it may not cause serious problems. But sometimes prostate cancer can grow quickly and spread to other parts of the body. This kind of prostate cancer is serious. What causes prostate cancer? Researchers don't know for sure what causes prostate cancer. They do know that it happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA). Sometimes these genetic changes are inherited, meaning that you are born with them. There are also certain genetic changes that happen during your lifetime that can raise your risk of prostate cancer. But often the exact cause of these genetic changes is unknown. Who is more likely to develop prostate cancer? Anyone who has a prostate can develop prostate cancer. But certain factors can make you more likely to develop it: Age. Your chance of developing prostate cancer increases as you get older. Prostate cancer is rare in people under age 50. Family health history. Your risk of prostate cancer is higher if you have a parent, sibling, or child who has or has had prostate cancer. Race. African Americans are more likely to get prostate cancer.  They're also more likely to: Get prostate cancer at a younger age. Have more serious prostate cancer. Die from prostate cancer. What are the symptoms of prostate cancer? Prostate cancer doesn't always cause symptoms, especially at first. If it does cause symptoms, they may include: Problems urinating (peeing), such as: A urine stream that's weak, hard to start, or starts and stops Suddenly needing to urinate right away Urinating often, especially at night Pain or burning when urinating Blood in your urine or semen Pain in your lower back , hips, or pelvis that does not go away Painful ejaculation (the release of semen through the penis during orgasm) But many of these symptoms may be from other common prostate problems that aren't cancer, such as an enlarged prostate . You should discuss your prostate health with your health care provider if you: Have symptoms that could be prostate cancer Have a high risk for developing prostate cancer Had a screening test that suggests you could have prostate cancer What are prostate tests and how is prostate cancer diagnosed? Tests which check for prostate cancer include: A digital rectal exam (DRE). In this exam, your provider feels your prostate for lumps or anything unusual by inserting a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum. A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. A high PSA blood level may be a sign of prostate cancer. But many other things can cause high PSA levels, too. Imaging tests. These tests may use ultrasound or MRI to make pictures of your prostate. If these tests show that you might have prostate cancer, the next step is usually a prostate biopsy . A biopsy is the only way to diagnose prostate cancer. During a biopsy, a doctor uses a hollow needle to remove some prostate tissue. The tissue is studied under a microscope to look for cancer cells. What are the treatments for prostate cancer? Your treatment options usually depend on your age, your general health, and how serious the cancer is. Your treatment may include one or more options: Observation ,which is mostly used if you are older, your prostate cancer isn't likely to grow quickly, and you don't have symptoms or you have other medical conditions. Your doctor will keep checking on your cancer over time so to see whether you will need to start treatment for the cancer. There are two types of observation: Watchful waiting means having little or no testing. If symptoms begin or change, you will get treatment to relieve them, but not to treat the cancer. Active surveillance means having regular tests to see if your prostate cancer has changed. If the tests show the cancer is starting to grow or if you develop symptoms, then you will have treatment to try to cure the cancer. Surgery to remove your prostate gland may be an option if your cancer hasn't spread outside of your prostate. Radiation therapy uses high energy to kill cancer cells or prevent them from growing. Hormone therapy blocks cancer cells from getting the hormones they need to grow. It may include taking medicines or having surgery to remove the testicles. Chemotherapy uses medicines to kill cancer cells, slow their growth, or stop them from spreading. You might take the drugs by mouth, as an injection (shot), as a cream, or intravenously (by IV). Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells. This treatment causes less harm to healthy cells than radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Immunotherapy helps your own immune system to fight cancer. Can prostate cancer be prevented? Making healthy lifestyle changes may help to prevent some prostate cancers. These changes include: Being at a healthy weight Quitting smoking Getting enough exercise Eating healthy foods NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus
Prostate Cancer Screening,https://medlineplus.gov/prostatecancerscreening.html,"What is cancer screening? Cancer is a disease when the cells of the body grow out of control. Cancer screening is having tests to look for signs of cancer before you have any symptoms. By the time cancer causes symptoms, it may have already spread to other parts of your body. A screening test may help find cancer early, when it may be easier to treat. Cancer screening only tells you whether you might have cancer. It doesn't diagnose cancer. If a screening test shows signs of cancer, you'll need to have other tests to find out if you do have cancer and how serious it may be. What is prostate cancer screening? Prostate cancer screening looks for signs of cancer in the prostate. The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder. It makes fluid that is part of semen. Prostate cancer is most common in people over age 50. It usually grows slowly and doesn't cause health problems. In fact, it's possible to live a long life with prostate cancer and never know you have it. But in certain cases, prostate cancer may spread to other parts of the body and can be very serious. The goal of prostate cancer screening is to find prostate cancers that may be more likely to spread so they can be treated early. What tests screen for prostate cancer? Two tests are commonly used to screen for prostate cancer: A prostate-specific antigen test , also called a PSA blood test. PSA is a protein made by your prostate. A high level of PSA in your blood may mean you have prostate cancer, but it's not proof of cancer.  That's because many other things may cause high PSA levels, including: Having an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH) Having other common prostate problems Taking certain medicines In general, the higher your PSA, the more likely it is that you have cancer. But a low PSA blood level isn't a guarantee that you don't have cancer. Digital Rectal Examination (DRE). The DRE is a prostate exam.  In this exam, your health care provider inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum to feel your prostate for lumps or anything unusual. A DRE can check only one side of the prostate. A PSA test or a DRE may be able to detect prostate cancer at an early stage. But it is not clear whether early detection and treatment lower the risk of dying from prostate cancer. You should talk with your provider about the benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening. What are the possible benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening? The possible benefits of prostate cancer screening include: Finding and treating prostate cancer early before it spreads Getting a better sense of your prostate cancer risk (based on your PSA test) Peace of mind if your screening shows you're unlikely to have prostate cancer now The option to choose further testing and closely monitor your prostate if your screening shows you may have cancer The possible harms of prostate cancer screening include: Getting a false positive result. This means that your PSA test shows you may have prostate cancer when you really don't. A false positive may lead to: Worry while you have more tests to look for signs of cancer. A prostate biopsy .  In a biopsy, a doctor removes tissue from your prostate so it can be studied under a microscope to look for cancer cells. This is the only way to diagnose cancer. The possible harms of a prostate biopsy include: Fever Pain Blood in semen Urinary tract infection Having prostate cancer treatment that you may not have needed. Prostate cancer screening may lead to a cancer diagnosis, but it's not always clear whether the cancer is likely to grow and spread. You could have unnecessary treatment for cancer that would never have caused any health problems. And the common prostate cancer treatments may have serious, permanent complications, such as: Urinary incontinence Erectile dysfunction Problems controlling your bowel movements (BMs) Should I be screened for prostate cancer? Since there are benefits and risks to prostate screening, you should talk with your provider to decide if screening is right for you. You and your provider should consider: Your age. The risk of prostate cancer increases after age 50. Your family health history. If members of your family have had prostate cancer, your risk may be higher. Your race. Prostate cancer is more common in African Americans.  They also have a higher risk of developing prostate cancer at a younger age and having more serious disease. Your general health. Are you well enough to have treatment for prostate cancer if it's found? What you prefer. How do you feel about the possible benefits and harms of screening, diagnosis, and treatment?

It's the most common type of prostate problem in people under than age 50. There are different types: Chronic prostatitis is also called chronic pelvic pain syndrome. It's the most common type of prostatitis. Acute bacterial prostatitis starts suddenly from a bacterial infection and is treated with antibiotics . It is not common. Chronic bacterial prostatitis happens when a bacterial infection keeps coming back. The symptoms usually start slowly. It may take longer to treat than acute bacterial prostatitis. Asymptomatic prostatitis has no symptoms and usually doesn't need treatment. You may learn you have it after having tests for other health problems. Enlarged prostate is also called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) . The prostate gland tends to grow larger with age. That's why enlarged prostate is very common in older people and rare in those who are under age 40. When the prostate grows larger, it may press on your urethra and cause problems with urination . Prostate cancer happens when cancer cells form in the prostate gland. Prostate cancer is a common type of cancer in those aged 50 and older. Most prostate cancers grow slowly and may never cause health problems. But certain prostate cancers are serious. Who is more likely to develop prostate diseases? Anyone with a prostate can develop prostate problems. But some people are at higher risk. You may be more likely to develop prostatitis if you have: A lower urinary tract infection , also called a UTI. An infection in your lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra) may lead to acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis. Nerve damage in your lower urinary tract from surgery or an injury. This may lead to chronic prostatitis. Emotional stress , which can lead to chronic prostatitis. You may be more likely to develop an enlarged prostate (BPH) if you: Are age 40 or older. Have family members who have had BPH. Have certain health conditions such as: Obesity . Heart disease and problems with blood circulation . Type 2 diabetes . Don't get enough physical activity . You may be more likely to develop prostate cancer if you: Are older than age 50. Have a parent, sibling, or child who has or had prostate cancer. Are African American. What are the symptoms of prostate diseases? The symptoms of prostate problems include: Needing to urinate a lot . Needing to rush to the bathroom, but not being able to urinate or only going a little. Leaking or dribbling urine . Having a weak urine stream. Other symptoms depend on the type of prostate problem you have and may include: Not being able to urinate at all. This is a medical emergency. Any problems, starting or controlling urine flow. Waking up often to urinate. Blood in your urine or urine that has an unusual smell or color. Fever , chills, or body aches. Great discomfort or pain: While urinating or after ejaculation. In your abdomen (belly), between your scrotum and anus, or in your scrotum or penis. Contact your provider if you have any of these symptoms. How are prostate diseases diagnosed? To find out if you have a prostate problem, your provider will: Ask about your medical history and symptoms. Ask about your family health history. Do a physical exam. The exam may include a digital rectal exam (DRE) of your prostate. In a DRE, your provider inserts a gloved finger into your rectum to feel the general size and condition of your prostate. Order tests, if needed. Tests may include: Blood and urine tests to look for infection. Urodynamic testing to see how well you can hold and release urine. Cystoscopy to look inside your urethra and bladder . Ultrasound pictures of your prostate and urinary tract. A PSA blood test (prostate-specific antigen test). Prostate biopsy to diagnose or rule out cancer. Treatment depends on what prostate disease you have and which symptoms bother you most.

Psoriasis,https://medlineplus.gov/psoriasis.html,"Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes itchy or sore patches of thick, red skin with silvery scales. You usually get the patches on your elbows, knees, scalp, back, face, palms and feet, but they can show up on other parts of your body.  Some people who have psoriasis also get a form of arthritis called psoriatic arthritis . A problem with your immune system causes psoriasis. In a process called cell turnover, skin cells that grow deep in your skin rise to the surface. Normally, this takes a month. In psoriasis, it happens in just days because your cells rise too fast. Psoriasis can be hard to diagnose because it can look like other skin diseases. Your doctor might need to look at a small skin sample under a microscope. Psoriasis can last a long time, even a lifetime. Symptoms come and go. Things that make them worse include: Infections Stress Dry skin Certain medicines Psoriasis usually occurs in adults. It sometimes runs in families. Treatments include creams, medicines, and light therapy. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases",MedlinePlus

Psychotic Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/psychoticdisorders.html,"Psychotic disorders are severe mental disorders that cause abnormal thinking and perceptions. People with psychoses lose touch with reality. Two of the main symptoms are delusions and hallucinations. Delusions are false beliefs, such as thinking that someone is plotting against you or that the TV is sending you secret messages. Hallucinations are false perceptions, such as hearing, seeing, or feeling something that is not there. Schizophrenia is one type of psychotic disorder. People with bipolar disorder may also have psychotic symptoms. Other problems that can cause psychosis include alcohol and some drugs, brain tumors, brain infections, and stroke. Treatment depends on the cause of the psychosis. It might involve drugs to control symptoms and talk therapy.

Puberty,https://medlineplus.gov/puberty.html,"Puberty is the time in life when a boy or girl becomes sexually mature. It is a process that usually happens between ages 10 and 14 for girls and ages 12 and 16 for boys.  It causes physical changes, and affects boys and girls differently. In girls: The first sign of puberty is usually breast development. Then hair grows in the pubic area and armpits. Menstruation (or a period) usually happens last. In boys: Puberty usually begins with the testicles and penis getting bigger. Then hair grows in the pubic area and armpits. Muscles grow, the voice deepens, and facial hair develops as puberty continues. Both boys and girls may get acne.  They also usually have a growth spurt (a rapid increase in height) that lasts for about 2 or 3 years.  This brings them closer to their adult height, which they reach after puberty.

Pubic Lice,https://medlineplus.gov/pubiclice.html,"What are pubic lice? Pubic lice (also called crabs) are tiny insects which usually live in the pubic or genital area of humans. They are also sometimes found on other coarse body hair, such as hair on the legs, armpits, mustache, beard, eyebrows, or eyelashes. Pubic lice on the eyebrows or eyelashes of children or teens may be a sign of sexual exposure or abuse . Pubic lice are parasites, and they need to feed on human blood to survive. They are one of the three types of lice that live on humans. The other two types are head lice and body lice . Each type of lice is different, and getting one type does not mean that you will get another type. How do pubic lice spread? Pubic lice move by crawling, because they cannot hop or fly. They usually spread through sexual contact. Occasionally, they may spread through physical contact with a person who has pubic lice, or through contact with clothing, beds, bed linens, or towels that were used by a person with pubic lice. You cannot get pubic lice from animals. Who is at risk for pubic lice? Since they spread mainly through sexual contact, pubic lice are most common in adults. What are the symptoms of pubic lice? The most common symptom of pubic lice is intense itching in the genital area. You may also see nits (lice eggs) or crawling lice. How do you know if you have pubic lice? A diagnosis of a pubic lice usually comes from seeing a louse or nit. But lice and nits can be difficult to find because there may be only a few present. Also, they often attach themselves to more than one hair, and they do not crawl as quickly as head and body lice. Sometimes it takes a magnifying lens to see the lice or nits. People who have pubic lice should also be checked for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and their sexual partners should also be checked for pubic lice. What are the treatments for pubic lice? The main treatment for pubic lice is a lice-killing lotion. Options include a lotion that contains permethrin or a mousse containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide. These products are available over-the-counter without a prescription. They are safe and effective when you use them according to the instructions. Usually one treatment will get rid of the lice. If not, you may need another treatment after 9-10 days. There are other lice-killing medicines that are available with a prescription from your health care provider. You should also wash your clothes, bedding, and towels with hot water, and dry them using the hot cycle of the dryer. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus
Pulmonary Embolism,https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryembolism.html,"What is a pulmonary embolism (PE)? A pulmonary embolism (PE) is a sudden blockage in a lung artery. It usually happens when a blood clot breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. PE is a serious condition that can cause: Permanent damage to the lungs Low oxygen levels in your blood Damage to other organs in your body from not getting enough oxygen PE can be life-threatening, especially if a clot is large, or if there are many clots. What causes a pulmonary embolism (PE)? The cause is usually a blood clot that breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. The clot is usually a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a clot in the leg. In rare cases, material such as air bubbles, clumps of fat, or parts of a tumor can block the lung artery and cause PE. Who is more likely to develop a pulmonary embolism (PE)? Anyone can get a pulmonary embolism (PE), but certain things can raise your risk of PE: Having surgery, especially joint replacement surgery. Certain medical conditions, including Cancers Heart diseases Lung diseases A broken hip or leg bone or other trauma Hormone-based medicines, such as birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy . Pregnancy and childbirth. The risk is highest for about six weeks after childbirth. Not moving for long periods, such as being on bed rest, having a cast, or taking a long plane flight. Age. Your risk increases as you get older, especially after age 40. Family history and genetics. Certain genetic changes that can increase your risk of blood clots and PE. Obesity . What are the symptoms of a pulmonary embolism (PE)? Symptoms of PE include: Shortness of breath Rapid breathing Chest pain or discomfort, which usually gets worse when you cough or take a deep breath Increased heart rate Coughing up blood Very low blood pressure, lightheadedness, or fainting Sometimes people with PE don't have any symptoms until they have serious complications, such as pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs). How is a pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosed? It can be difficult to diagnose PE. To find out if you have a PE, your health care provider will: Take your medical history, including asking about your symptoms and risk factors for PE Do a physical exam Likely order some tests, including various imaging and blood tests What are the treatments for a pulmonary embolism (PE)? If you have PE, you need medical treatment right away. The goal of treatment is to break up clots and help keep other clots from forming. Treatment options include medicines and procedures. Medicines : Anticoagulants, or blood thinners , keep blood clots from getting larger and stop new clots from forming. You might get them as an injection, a pill, or through an I.V. (intravenous). They can cause bleeding, especially if you are taking other medicines that also thin your blood, such as aspirin. Thrombolytics are medicines to dissolve blood clots. You may get them if you have large clots that cause severe symptoms or other serious complications. Thrombolytics can cause sudden bleeding, so they are used if your PE is serious and may be life-threatening. Procedures : Catheter-assisted thrombus removal uses a flexible tube to reach a blood clot in your lung. Your health care provider can insert a tool in the tube to break up the clot or to deliver medicine through the tube. Usually you will get medicine to put you to sleep for this procedure. A vena cava filter may be used in some people who cannot take blood thinners. Your health care provider inserts a filter inside a large vein called the vena cava. The filter catches blood clots before they travel to the lungs, which prevents pulmonary embolism. But the filter does not stop new blood clots from forming. Can pulmonary embolism (PE) be prevented? Preventing new blood clots can prevent PE. Prevention may include: Continuing to take blood thinners. It's also important to get regular checkups with your provider, to make sure that the dosage of your medicines is working to prevent blood clots but not causing bleeding. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating, exercise, and, if you smoke, quitting smoking . Using compression stockings to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Moving your legs when sitting for long periods of time (such as on long trips). Moving around as soon as possible after surgery or being confined to a bed.

Pulmonary Fibrosis,https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryfibrosis.html,"Pulmonary fibrosis is a condition in which the tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time.  This tissue gets thick and stiff.  That makes it hard for you to catch your breath, and your blood may not get enough oxygen. Causes of pulmonary fibrosis include environmental pollutants, some medicines, some connective tissue diseases, and interstitial lung disease. Interstitial lung disease is the name for a large group of diseases that inflame or scar the lungs. In most cases, the cause cannot be found.  This is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Symptoms include: Shortness of breath A dry, hacking cough that doesn't get better Fatigue Weight loss for no known reason Aching muscles and joints Clubbing, which is the widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes Your doctor may use your medical history, imaging tests, a biopsy, and lung function tests to diagnose pulmonary fibrosis.

Pulmonary Hypertension,https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryhypertension.html,"What is pulmonary hypertension? Pulmonary hypertension, sometimes called PH, is a serious condition that affects the blood vessels in the lungs. It develops when the blood pressure in your lungs is higher than normal. Your heart pumps blood to your lungs so they can add oxygen to the blood. The blood goes back to your heart. From there, it travels to the rest of your body so that your tissues can get the oxygen that they need. The blood moves from your heart to your lungs through blood vessels called pulmonary arteries. If the pulmonary arteries become damaged, narrowed, or blocked, the blood does not flow through them as well. This can increase the blood pressure in the arteries and cause pulmonary hypertension. There are different types of pulmonary hypertension, including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The different types are based on what caused the disease. What causes pulmonary hypertension? Pulmonary hypertension can develop on its own or be caused by another condition. Sometimes the cause is unknown or is not clear. Some of the possible causes include: Heart diseases , including left-sided heart failure and congenital heart disease Lung diseases such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), interstitial lung disease , emphysema , and sleep apnea Other medical conditions such as: Liver diseases Sickle cell disease Pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lungs) Connective tissue disorders like scleroderma Who is more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension? Certain factors can make you more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension, such as: Your age. The risk increases as you get older. The condition is usually diagnosed between ages 30 and 60. Your environment. Being exposed to asbestos or having certain infections caused by parasites can raise your risk. Your family history and genetics. Certain genetic disorders , such as Down syndrome , congenital heart disease, and Gaucher disease , can raise your risk of pulmonary hypertension. So can a family history of blood clots . Your lifestyle habits. Smoking and illegal drug use can raise your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension. Certain medicines. For example, some medicines used to treat cancer and depression can make you more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension. Your sex. Pulmonary hypertension is more common in women than in men. What are the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension? The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension are sometimes hard to recognize and are similar to the symptoms of other medical conditions. So sometimes it can take years for someone to get diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension. The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension may include: Shortness of breath Chest pain or pressure Dizziness that may lead to fainting Fatigue Swelling of the abdomen, legs, or feet Heart palpitations (the feeling that your heart is pounding or beating too fast) What other problems can pulmonary hypertension cause? Pulmonary hypertension can get worse over time and lead to serious problems, including: Anemia , which can cause your body to not get enough oxygen-rich blood Arrhythmias , problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat Blood clots in the pulmonary arteries Bleeding in the lungs Heart failure Liver damage Pericardial effusion, a collection of fluid around the heart Serious pregnancy complications How is pulmonary hypertension diagnosed? To find out if you have pulmonary hypertension, your health care provider: Will ask about your medical history and symptoms Will do a physical exam, which may include checking your blood oxygen, listening to your heart and lungs, and checking your blood pressure Will likely order some tests, such as: Blood tests to look for blood clots, stress on the heart, or anemia Heart imaging tests, such as a cardiac MRI Lung imaging tests, such as chest x-ray An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) What are the treatments for pulmonary hypertension? Often there is no cure for pulmonary hypertension, but treatments can help manage your symptoms. Your provider will work with you to come up with a treatment plan. It will be based on your needs and the cause of the pulmonary hypertension. The plan may include: Healthy lifestyle changes, such as: Healthy eating , which includes eating less salt Regular physical activity , which may be done through pulmonary rehabilitation Medicines, such as: Blood thinners Medicines to control the rate blood is pumped throughout the body Medicines to relax blood vessels and allow the blood to flow better Medicine to reduce swelling (diuretics) Oxygen therapy Procedures to reduce pressure in the heart or pulmonary artery In some severe cases, a lung transplant NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Pulmonary Rehabilitation,https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryrehabilitation.html,"What is pulmonary rehabilitation? Pulmonary rehabilitation, also known as pulmonary rehab or PR, is a program for people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems . It can help improve your ability to function and quality of life. PR does not replace your medical treatment. Instead, you use them together. PR is often an outpatient program that you do in a hospital or clinic. Some people have PR in their homes. You work with a team of health care providers to find ways to lessen your symptoms, increase your ability to exercise, and make it easier to do your daily activities. Who needs pulmonary rehabilitation? Your health care provider may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) if you have a chronic lung disease or another condition that makes it hard for you to breathe and limits your activities. For example, PR may help you if you: Have COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The two main types are emphysema and chronic bronchitis . In COPD, your airways (tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs) are partially blocked. This makes it hard to get air in and out. Have an interstitial lung disease such as sarcoidosis and pulmonary fibrosis . These diseases cause scarring of the lungs over time. This makes it hard to get enough oxygen. Have cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an inherited disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to collect in the lungs and block the airways. Need lung surgery. You may have PR before and after lung surgery to help you prepare for and recover from the surgery. Have a muscle-wasting disorder that affects the muscles used for breathing. An example is muscular dystrophy . PR works best if you start it before your disease is severe. However, even people who have advanced lung disease can benefit from PR. What does pulmonary rehabilitation include? When you first start pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), your team of health care providers will want to learn more about your health. You will have lung function, exercise, and possibly blood tests. Your team will go over your medical history and current treatments. They may check on your mental health and ask about your diet. Then they will work together to create a plan that is right for you. It may include: Exercise training. Your team will come up with an exercise plan to improve your endurance and muscle strength. You will likely have exercises for both your arms and legs. You might use a treadmill, stationary bike, or weights. You may need to start slowly and increase your exercise as you get stronger. Nutritional counseling. Being either overweight or underweight can affect your breathing. A nutritious eating plan can help you work towards a healthy weight. Education about your disease and how to manage it. This includes learning how to avoid situations that make your symptoms worse, how to avoid infections, and how/when to take your medicines. Techniques you can use to save your energy. Your team may teach you easier ways to do daily tasks. For example, you may learn ways to avoid reaching, lifting, or bending. Those movements make it harder to breathe, since they use up energy and make you tighten your abdominal muscles. You may also learn how to better deal with stress , since stress can also take up energy and affect your breathing. Breathing strategies. You will learn techniques to improve your breathing. These techniques may increase your oxygen levels, decrease how often you take breaths, and keep your airways open longer. Psychological counseling and/or group support. It can feel scary to have trouble breathing. If you have a chronic lung disease, you are more likely to have depression , anxiety , or other emotional problems. Many PR programs include counseling and/or support groups. If not, your PR team may be able to refer you to an organization that offers them.

Radiation Exposure,https://medlineplus.gov/radiationexposure.html,"What is radiation? Radiation is energy. It travels in the form of energy waves or high-speed particles. Radiation can occur naturally or be man-made. There are two types: Non-ionizing radiation, which includes radio waves, cell phones, microwaves, infrared radiation and visible light Ionizing radiation, which includes ultraviolet radiation, radon , x-rays , and gamma rays What are the sources of radiation exposure? Background radiation is all around us all the time. Most of it forms naturally from minerals. These radioactive minerals are in the ground, soil, water, and even our bodies. Background radiation can also come from outer space and the sun. Other sources are man-made, such as x-rays, radiation therapy to treat cancer, and electrical power lines. What are the health effects of radiation exposure? Radiation has been around us throughout our evolution. So our bodies are designed to deal with the low levels we're exposed to every day. But too much radiation can damage tissues by changing cell structure and damaging DNA. This can cause serious health problems, including cancer. The amount of damage that exposure to radiation can cause depends on several factors, including: The type of radiation The dose (amount) of radiation How you were exposed, such as through skin contact, swallowing or breathing it in, or having rays pass through your body Where the radiation concentrates in the body and how long it stays there How sensitive your body is to radiation. A fetus is most vulnerable to the effects of radiation. Infants, children, older adults, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems are more vulnerable to health effects than healthy adults. Being exposed to a lot of radiation over a short period of time, such as from a radiation emergency , can cause skin burns . It may also lead to acute radiation syndrome (ARS, or ""radiation sickness"").  The symptoms of ARS include headache and diarrhea. They usually start within hours. Those symptoms will go away and the person will seem healthy for a little while. But then they will get sick again. How soon they get sick again, which symptoms they have, and how sick they get depends on the amount of radiation they received. In some cases, ARS causes death in the following days or weeks. Exposure to low levels of radiation in the environment does not cause immediate health effects. But it can slightly increase your overall risk of cancer. What are the treatments for acute radiation sickness? Before they start treatment, health care professionals need to figure out how much radiation your body absorbed. They will ask about your symptoms, do blood tests, and may use a device that measures radiation. They also try get more information about the exposure, such as what type of radiation it was, how far away you were from the source of the radiation, and how long you were exposed. Treatment focuses on reducing and treating infections, preventing dehydration , and treating injuries and burns. Some people may need treatments that help the bone marrow recover its function. If you were exposed to certain types of radiation, your provider may give you a treatment that limits or removes the contamination that is inside your body. You may also get treatments for your symptoms. How can radiation exposure be prevented? There are steps you can take to prevent or reduce radiation exposure: If your health care provider recommends a test that uses radiation, ask about its risks and benefits. In some cases, you may be able to have a different test that does not use radiation. But if you do need a test that uses radiation, do some research into the local imaging facilities. Find one that monitors and uses techniques to reduce the doses they are giving patients. Reduce electromagnetic radiation exposure from your cell phone. At this time, scientific evidence has not found a link between cell phone use and health problems in humans. More research is needed to be sure. But if you still have concerns, you can reduce how much time you spend on your phone. You can also use speaker mode or a headset to place more distance between your head and the cell phone. If you live in a house, test the radon levels, and if you need to, get a radon reduction system. During a radiation emergency, get inside a building to take shelter. Stay inside, with all of the windows and doors shut. Stay tuned to and follow the advice of emergency responders and officials. Environmental Protection Agency",MedlinePlus
Radiation Therapy,https://medlineplus.gov/radiationtherapy.html,"What is radiation therapy? Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment. It uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and stop them from spreading. It may also be used for easing cancer symptoms. Radiation therapy may damage healthy cells. They can usually repair themselves more easily than cancer cells. You may need days or weeks of treatment before the radiation starts killing cancer cells. But cancer cells should keep dying for weeks or months after your treatment ends. When is radiation therapy used for cancer treatment? Radiation therapy treats many types of cancer. It may be used at different times or for different reasons during your treatment. Sometimes radiation is used with other treatments, like surgery, chemotherapy , or immunotherapy . How is radiation therapy given? You may get radiation therapy once a day or in smaller doses twice a day for a few weeks. The radiation may be external, from special machines, or internal from radioactive substances placed inside your body. The type of radiation therapy you get depends on many factors, including: The type of cancer The size of the cancer Where the cancer is in your body How close the cancer is to normal tissues that are sensitive to radiation How far the radiation needs to travel into your body Your general health and medical history Whether you will have other types of cancer treatment Other factors, such as your age and other medical conditions What are the side effects of radiation therapy? Your treatment must be carefully planned to reduce side effects. Radiation therapy can damage normal cells as well as cancer cells. Healthy cells usually repair themselves but damaging them can cause side effects. Side effects can vary from person to person. Common side effects include skin changes and fatigue . Other side effects depend on the part of your body being treated. Most side effects go away a few months after you are done with treatment. NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus
Radon,https://medlineplus.gov/radon.html,"What is radon? Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas. It is invisible and has no odor or taste. It comes from the normal decay of uranium and thorium. These are two chemical elements that can be found in soil, rock, and groundwater. Radon breaks down quickly, giving off radioactive particles. Over time, breathing in high levels of these particles can cause lung cancer . How would I be exposed to radon? Outdoors, there are low levels of radon in the air. But radon can also be indoors. It can enter homes and buildings through cracks in the floors, walls, or foundations. Certain building materials can give off radon. And sometimes radon gets inside through well water. Radon levels can be higher in homes and buildings that are well insulated, tightly sealed, and/or built on soil that has a lot of uranium and thorium. Basements and first floors usually have the highest radon levels because they are closer to the ground. How does radon cause lung cancer? When you breathe in radon, its radioactive decay products can get trapped in your lungs. They can damage the cells that line your lungs. Over time, it can lead to lung cancer. It may take years before this happens. Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer deaths after cigarette smoking . If you smoke and are exposed to radon, your risk of lung cancer is much higher than if you did not smoke. Most radon-related cancer deaths happen in smokers. How do I know if my home has high levels of radon? Testing is the only way to know if there are high levels of radon in your home. You should test your home's radon levels: If it's never been tested or the radon levels are unknown When preparing to buy or sell your house Before and after any renovations, especially after making any repairs to reduce radon levels Before making any lifestyle changes in the home that would cause someone to spend more time in the basement or lower level (such as converting a basement to a bedroom) Testing is fairly inexpensive and easy to do. You can buy a test kit at most hardware stores or hire someone to do a test. It's a good idea to first contact a state or local radon official for advice. They can explain the differences between testing devices and recommend the most appropriate test for your needs. They can also give you a list of qualified radon testers. There are both long- and short-term test kits: Short-term kits measure radon for 2-90 days for quick results Long-term kits measure radon in your home for over 90 days Radon levels can vary from day to day and month to month. So a long-term test will give a better estimate of your average radon level. How can I lower the radon level in my home? If the testing shows that you have an unsafe level of radon in your home, you can have a radon reduction system installed. It can bring the amount of radon down to a safe level. The cost of the system will depend on the size and design of your home. You can also take some other steps to reduce radon levels in your home: Increase air flow in your house by opening windows and using fans and vents to circulate air. But this will only temporarily reduce the radon levels. Seal cracks in floors and walls with plaster, caulk, or other materials designed for this purpose. After any fixes, monitor the radon levels to make sure that they are lower.",MedlinePlus

Although most rashes clear up fairly quickly, others are long-lasting and need  long-term treatment. Because rashes can be caused by many different things, it's important to figure out what kind you have before you treat it. If it is a bad rash, if it does not go away, or if you have other symptoms, you should see your health care provider. Treatments may include moisturizers, lotions, baths, cortisone creams that relieve swelling, and antihistamines, which relieve itching.",MedlinePlus
Raynaud Phenomenon,https://medlineplus.gov/raynaudphenomenon.html,"What is Raynaud phenomenon? Raynaud phenomenon is a condition that affects your blood vessels (the tubes that your blood flows through). It causes your blood vessels to narrow, which decreases blood flow. This is called a Raynaud episode or ""attack."" The attacks usually affect your fingers and toes, causing them to become cold and numb. They may also change color, usually to white or blue. These attacks happen in response to cold temperatures or stress . Raynaud phenomenon may also be called Raynaud disease or Raynaud syndrome. What are the types of Raynaud phenomenon? There are two types of Raynaud phenomenon: Primary Raynaud phenomenon is the more common type. Its cause is unknown. Secondary Raynaud phenomenon is usually caused by another disease or problem, such as lupus or scleroderma . Other causes may be exposure to cold or certain chemicals. The type can be more serious than the primary type. What causes Raynaud phenomenon? Researchers don't know exactly why some people develop Raynaud phenomenon. But they do understand how the attacks happen. When you are exposed to cold, your body tries to slow the loss of heat and maintain its temperature. To do this, the blood vessels in the top layer of your skin constrict (narrow). This moves blood from those vessels near the surface to vessels deeper in the body. But when you have Raynaud phenomenon, the blood vessels in your hands and feet react to cold or stress by narrowing quickly. They also stay narrowed for a long time. Who is more likely to develop Raynaud phenomenon? Anyone can develop Raynaud phenomenon, but some people are more likely to develop it: Primary Raynaud phenomenon has been linked to: Your sex. Women get it more often than men. Your age. It usually develops in people younger than age 30. It often starts in the teenage years. A family history of Raynaud phenomenon. You are more likely to develop Raynaud phenomenon if you have a family member who has it. Secondary Raynaud phenomenon has been linked to: Certain diseases. These include lupus, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), carpal tunnel syndrome , and connective tissue disorders . Certain medicines. Medicines that treat high blood pressure , migraines , and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may cause similar symptoms to Raynaud phenomenon or make your symptoms worse. Work-related exposures, such as repeated use of vibrating machinery (such as a jackhammer), or exposure to cold or certain chemicals. What are the symptoms of Raynaud phenomenon? Raynaud attacks most often happen when you get cold, for example when you grab something cold from the freezer or go into an air-conditioned building on a warm day. Attacks usually affect your fingers and toes. But sometimes they can affect other parts of your body, such as your ears, nose, lips, or nipples. An attack causes the skin to become cold and numb. Your skin may also turn white or blue due to a lack of oxygen. As the blood flow returns, your skin may tingle, throb, or turn red. An attack may last a few minutes or a few hours. If you have darker skin, you may not be able to easily see the skin color changes. For many people, especially those with the primary type, the symptoms are mild. People with the secondary type often have more severe symptoms. They may develop skin ulcers (open sores caused by poor blood flow) or skin infections . How is Raynaud phenomenon diagnosed? There is no specific test to diagnose Raynaud phenomenon. To find out if you have it, your health care provider: Will take your medical history and ask about your symptoms. Will do a physical exam. May order blood and other lab tests to check for other conditions which could be causing your symptoms and/or to help decide which type of Raynaud phenomenon you have. What are the treatments for Raynaud phenomenon? Most people with Raynaud phenomenon can keep their symptoms under control by avoiding getting cold. But if this is not enough, medicines and, in some cases, surgical procedures can help. Secondary Raynaud phenomenon is more likely to be serious and to need more treatments. It's also important to treat the condition or problem that is causing your Raynaud phenomenon. You may need to see a specialist such as a rheumatologist, a doctor who treats diseases of the joints, muscles, and bones. Can Raynaud phenomenon be prevented? Raynaud phenomenon cannot be prevented, but you can help prevent attacks and manage your symptoms by: Placing your hands or feet in a warm place when you have an attack. This could mean putting them under warm (not hot) water or under a heating pad. Keeping your body, especially your hands and feet, warm in cold weather. Avoiding triggers, such as certain medicines and stress. Quitting smoking (or not starting smoking). Managing stress.

Reflux in Children,https://medlineplus.gov/refluxinchildren.html,"What are reflux (GER) and GERD? The esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. If your child has reflux, his or her stomach contents come back up into the esophagus. Another name for reflux is gastroesophageal reflux (GER). GERD stands for gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is a more serious and long-lasting type of reflux. If your child has reflux more than twice a week for a few weeks, it could be GERD. What causes reflux and GERD in children? There is a muscle (the lower esophageal sphincter) that acts as a valve between the esophagus and stomach. When your child swallows, this muscle relaxes to let food pass from the esophagus to the stomach. This muscle normally stays closed, so the stomach contents don't flow back into the esophagus. In children who have reflux and GERD, this muscle becomes weak or relaxes when it shouldn't, and the stomach contents flow back into the esophagus. This can happen because of: A hiatal hernia , a condition in which the upper part of your stomach pushes upward into your chest through an opening in your diaphragm Increased pressure on the abdomen from being overweight or having obesity Medicines, such as certain asthma medicines, antihistamines (which treat allergies), pain relievers , sedatives (which help put people to sleep), and antidepressants Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke A previous surgery on the esophagus or upper abdomen A severe developmental delay Certain neurological conditions , such as cerebral palsy How common are reflux and GERD in children? Many children have occasional reflux. GERD is not as common; up to 25% of children have symptoms of GERD. What are the symptoms of reflux and GERD in children? Your child might not even notice reflux. But some children taste food or stomach acid at the back of the mouth. In children, GERD can cause: Heartburn , a painful, burning feeling in the middle of the chest. It is more common in older children (12 years and up). Bad breath Nausea and vomiting Problems swallowing or painful swallowing Breathing problems The wearing away of teeth How do doctors diagnose reflux and GERD in children? In most cases, a doctor diagnoses reflux by reviewing your child's symptoms and medical history. If the symptoms do not get better with lifestyle changes and anti-reflux medicines, your child may need testing to check for GERD or other problems. Several tests can help a doctor diagnose GERD. Sometimes doctors order more than one test to get a diagnosis. Commonly-used tests include: Upper GI series , which looks at the shape of your child's upper GI (gastrointestinal) tract. You child will drink a contrast liquid called barium. For young children, the barium is mixed in with a bottle or other food. The health care professional will take several x-rays of your child to track the barium as it goes through the esophagus and stomach. Esophageal pH and impedance monitoring , which measures the amount of acid or liquid in your child's esophagus. A doctor or nurse places a thin flexible tube through your child's nose into the stomach. The end of the tube in the esophagus measures when and how much acid comes back up into the esophagus. The other end of the tube attaches to a monitor that records the measurements. Your child will wear the tube for 24 hours. He or she may need to stay in the hospital during the test. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and biopsy , which uses an endoscope, a long, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end of it. The doctor runs the endoscope down your child's esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine. While looking at the pictures from the endoscope, the doctor may also take tissue samples ( biopsy ). What lifestyle changes can help treat my child's reflux or GERD? Sometimes reflux and GERD in children can be treated with lifestyle changes: Losing weight, if needed Eating smaller meals Avoiding high-fat foods Wearing loose-fitting clothing around the abdomen Staying upright for 3 hours after meals and not reclining and slouching when sitting Sleeping at a slight angle. Raise the head of your child's bed 6 to 8 inches by safely putting blocks under the bedposts. What treatments might the doctor give for my child's GERD? If changes at home do not help enough, the doctor may recommend medicines to treat GERD. The medicines work by lowering the amount of acid in your child's stomach. Some medicines for GERD in children are over-the-counter, and some are prescription medicines. They include: Over-the-counter antacids H2 blockers, which decrease acid production Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which lower the amount of acid the stomach makes Prokinetics, which help the stomach empty faster If these don't help and your child still has severe symptoms, then surgery might be an option. A pediatric gastroenterologist, a doctor who treats children who have digestive diseases, would do the surgery. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",MedlinePlus
Reflux in Infants,https://medlineplus.gov/refluxininfants.html,"What are reflux and GERD? The esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. If your baby has reflux, his or her stomach contents come back up into the esophagus. Another name for reflux is gastroesophageal reflux (GER). GERD stands for gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is a more serious and long-lasting type of reflux. Babies may have GERD if their symptoms prevent them from feeding or if the reflux lasts more than 12 to 14 months. What causes reflux and GERD in infants? There is a muscle (the lower esophageal sphincter) that acts as a valve between the esophagus and stomach. When your baby swallows, this muscle relaxes to let food pass from the esophagus to the stomach. This muscle normally stays closed, so the stomach contents don't flow back into the esophagus. In babies who have reflux, the lower esophageal sphincter muscle is not fully developed and lets the stomach contents back up the esophagus. This causes your baby to spit up (regurgitate). Once his or her sphincter muscle fully develops, your baby should no longer spit up. In babies who have GERD, the sphincter muscle becomes weak or relaxes when it shouldn't. How common are reflux and GERD in infants? Reflux is very common in babies. About half of all babies spit up many times a day in the first 3 months of their lives. They usually stop spitting up between the ages of 12 and 14 months. GERD is also common in younger infants. Many 4-month-olds have it. But by their first birthday, only 10% of babies still have GERD. What are the symptoms of reflux and GERD in infants? In babies, the main symptom of reflux and GERD is spitting up. GERD may also cause symptoms such as: Arching of the back, often during or right after eating Colic - crying that lasts for more than 3 hours a day with no medical cause Coughing Gagging or trouble swallowing Irritability, especially after eating Poor eating or refusing to eat Poor weight gain, or weight loss Wheezing or trouble breathing Forceful or frequent vomiting How do doctors diagnose reflux and GERD in infants? In most cases, a doctor diagnoses reflux by reviewing your baby's symptoms and medical history.

The doctor runs the endoscope down your baby's esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine. While looking at the pictures from the endoscope, the doctor may also take tissue samples ( biopsy ). What feeding changes can help treat my infant's reflux or GERD? Feeding changes may help your baby's reflux and GERD: Add rice cereal to your baby's bottle of formula or breastmilk. Check with the doctor about how much to add. If the mixture is too thick, you can change the nipple size or cut a little ""x"" in the nipple to make the opening larger. Burp your baby after every 1 to 2 ounces of formula. If you breastfeed, burp your baby after nursing from each breast. Avoid overfeeding; give your baby the amount of formula or breast milk recommended. Hold your baby upright for 30 minutes after feedings. If you use formula and your doctor thinks that your baby may be sensitive to milk protein, your doctor may suggest switching to a different type of formula. Do not change formulas without talking to the doctor. What treatments might the doctor give for my infant's GERD? If feeding changes do not help enough, the doctor may recommend medicines to treat GERD. The medicines work by lowering the amount of acid in your baby's stomach. The doctor will only suggest medicine if your baby still has regular GERD symptoms and: You already tried some feeding changes Your baby has problems sleeping or feeding Your baby does not grow properly The doctor will often prescribe a medicine on a trial basis and will explain any possible complications. You shouldn't give your baby any medicines unless the doctor tells you to. Medicines for GERD in babies include: H2 blockers, which decrease acid production Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which lower the amount of acid the stomach makes If these don't help and your baby still has severe symptoms, then surgery might be an option. Pediatric gastroenterologists only use surgery to treat GERD in babies in rare cases. They may suggest surgery when babies have severe breathing problems or have a physical problem that causes GERD symptoms.

Refractive Errors,https://medlineplus.gov/refractiveerrors.html,"The cornea and lens of your eye helps you focus.  Refractive errors are vision problems that happen when the shape of the eye keeps you from focusing well. The cause could be the length of the eyeball (longer or shorter), changes in the shape of the cornea, or aging of the lens. Four common refractive errors are: Myopia, or nearsightedness - clear vision close up but  blurry in the distance Hyperopia, or farsightedness - clear vision in the distance but blurry 
close up Presbyopia - inability to focus close up as a result of aging Astigmatism - focus problems caused by the cornea The most common symptom is blurred vision.

These abilities may be physical, mental, and/or cognitive (thinking and learning). You may have lost them because of a disease or injury, or as a side effect from a medical treatment. Rehabilitation can improve your daily life and functioning. Who needs rehabilitation? Rehabilitation is for people who have lost abilities that they need for daily life. Some of the most common causes include: Injuries and trauma, including burns , fractures (broken bones), traumatic brain injury , and spinal cord injuries Stroke Severe infections Major surgery Side effects from medical treatments, such as from cancer treatments Certain birth defects and genetic disorders Developmental disabilities Chronic pain , including back and neck pain What are the goals of rehabilitation? The overall goal of rehabilitation is to help you get your abilities back and regain independence. But the specific goals are different for each person. They depend on what caused the problem, whether the cause is ongoing or temporary, which abilities you lost, and how severe the problem is. For example,: A person who has had a stroke may need rehabilitation to be able to dress or bathe without help An active person who has had a heart attack may go through cardiac rehabilitation to try to return to exercising Someone with a lung disease may get pulmonary rehabilitation to be able to breathe better and improve their quality of life What happens in a rehabilitation program? When you get rehabilitation, you often have a team of different health care providers helping you. They will work with you to figure out your needs, goals, and treatment plan. The types of treatments that may be in a treatment plan include: Assistive devices , which are tools, equipment, and products that help people with disabilities move and function Cognitive rehabilitation therapy to help you relearn or improve skills such as thinking, learning, memory, planning, and decision making Mental health counseling Music or art therapy to help you express your feelings, improve your thinking, and develop social connections Nutritional counseling Occupational therapy to help you with your daily activities Physical therapy to help your strength, mobility, and fitness Recreational therapy to improve your emotional well-being through arts and crafts, games, relaxation training, and animal-assisted therapy Speech-language therapy to help with speaking, understanding, reading, writing and swallowing Treatment for pain Vocational rehabilitation to help you build skills for going to school or working at a job Depending on your needs, you may have rehabilitation in the providers' offices, a hospital, or an inpatient rehabilitation center.

Reproductive Hazards,https://medlineplus.gov/reproductivehazards.html,"What are reproductive hazards? Reproductive hazards are substances that affect the reproductive health of men or women. They also include substances that affect the ability of couples to have healthy children. These substances may be chemical, physical, or biological. Some common types include: Alcohol Chemicals such as pesticides Smoking Legal and illegal drugs Metals such as lead and mercury Radiation Some viruses You may be exposed to reproductive hazards through contact with your skin, breathing them in, or swallowing them. This can happen anywhere, but it is more common in the workplace or at home. What are the health effects of reproductive hazards? The possible health effects of reproductive hazards include infertility , miscarriage , birth defects , and developmental disabilities in children. What type of health effects they cause and how serious they are depends on many factors, including: What the substance is How much of it you are exposed to How it enters your body How long or how often you are exposed How you react to the substance How can reproductive hazards affect men? For a man, a reproductive hazard can affect the sperm. A hazard may cause a problem with the number of sperm, their shape, or the way that they swim. It could also damage the sperm's DNA. Then the sperm may not be able to fertilize an egg. Or it could cause problems with the development of the fetus . How can reproductive hazards affect women? For a woman, a reproductive hazard can disrupt the menstrual cycle . It can cause hormone imbalance, which can raise the risk of diseases such as osteoporosis , heart disease , and certain cancers. It can affect a woman's ability to get pregnant . A woman who is exposed during pregnancy can have different effects, depending on when she was exposed. During the first 3 months of pregnancy, it might cause a birth defect or a miscarriage. During the last 6 months of pregnancy, it could slow the growth of the fetus, affect the development of its brain, or cause preterm labor . How can reproductive hazards be avoided? To try to avoid reproductive hazards: Avoid alcohol and illegal drugs during pregnancy . If you smoke, try to quit . And if you are not a smoker, don't start. Take precautions if you are using household chemicals or pesticides. Use good hygiene , including handwashing.

Respiratory Failure,https://medlineplus.gov/respiratoryfailure.html,"What is respiratory failure? Respiratory failure is a condition in which your blood doesn't have enough oxygen or has too much carbon dioxide. Sometimes you can have both problems. When you breathe, your lungs take in oxygen. The oxygen passes into your blood, which carries it to your organs. Your organs, such as your heart and brain, need this oxygen-rich blood to work well. Another part of breathing is removing the carbon dioxide from the blood and breathing it out. Having too much carbon dioxide in your blood can harm your organs. What causes respiratory failure? Conditions that affect your breathing can cause respiratory failure. These conditions may affect the muscles, nerves, bones, or tissues that support breathing. Or they may affect the lungs directly. These conditions include: Diseases that affect the lungs , such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), cystic fibrosis , pneumonia , pulmonary embolism , and COVID-19 Conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), muscular dystrophy , spinal cord injuries , and stroke Problems with the spine, such as scoliosis (a curve in the spine). They can affect the bones and muscles used for breathing. Damage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs. An injury to the chest can cause this damage. Drug or alcohol overdose Inhalation injuries , such as from inhaling smoke (from fires) or harmful fumes What are the symptoms of respiratory failure? The symptoms of respiratory failure depend on the cause and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood. A low oxygen level in the blood can cause shortness of breath and air hunger (the feeling that you can't breathe in enough air). Your skin, lips, and fingernails may also have a bluish color. A high carbon dioxide level can cause rapid breathing and confusion. Some people who have respiratory failure may become very sleepy or lose consciousness. They also may have arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). You may have these symptoms if your brain and heart are not getting enough oxygen. How is respiratory failure diagnosed? Your health care provider will diagnose respiratory failure based on: Your medical history A physical exam, which often includes Listening to your lungs to check for abnormal sounds Listening to your heart to check for arrhythmia Looking for a bluish color on your skin, lips, and fingernails Diagnostic tests, such as Pulse oximetry, a small sensor that uses a light to measure how much oxygen is in your blood. The sensor goes on the end of your finger or on your ear. Arterial blood gas test, a test that measures the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood. The blood sample is taken from an artery, usually in your wrist. Once you are diagnosed with respiratory failure, your provider will look for what is causing it. Tests for this often include a chest x-ray. If your provider thinks you may have arrhythmia because of the respiratory failure, you may have an EKG (electrocardiogram). This is simple, painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. What are the treatments for respiratory failure? Treatment for respiratory failure depends on: Whether it is acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing) How severe it is What is causing it Acute respiratory failure can be a medical emergency. You may need treatment in intensive care unit at a hospital. Chronic respiratory failure can often be treated at home. But if your chronic respiratory failure is severe, you might need treatment in a long-term care center. One of the main goals of treatment is to get oxygen to your lungs and other organs and remove carbon dioxide from your body. Another goal is to treat the cause of the condition. Treatments may include: Oxygen therapy , through a nasal cannula (two small plastic tubes that go in your nostrils) or through a mask that fits over your nose and mouth Tracheostomy, a surgically-made hole that goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe. A breathing tube, also called a tracheostomy, or trach tube, is placed in the hole to help you breathe. Ventilator, a breathing machine that blows air into your lungs. It also carries carbon dioxide out of your lungs. Other breathing treatments, such as noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), which uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open while you sleep. Another treatment is a special bed that rocks back and forth, to help you breathe in and out. Fluids, often through an intravenous (IV), to improve blood flow throughout your body. They also provide nutrition. Medicines for discomfort Treatments for the cause of the respiratory failure. These treatments may include medicines and procedures. If you have respiratory failure, see your health care provider for ongoing medical care. Your provider may suggest pulmonary rehabilitation . If your respiratory failure is chronic, make sure that you know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You need emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. You should call your provider if you notice that your symptoms are worsening or if you have new signs and symptoms. Living with respiratory failure may cause fear, anxiety , depression , and stress . Talk therapy, medicines, and support groups can help you feel better. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/respiratorysyncytialvirusinfections.html,"What is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)? Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is a common respiratory virus. It usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. But it can cause serious lung infections, especially in infants, older adults, and people with serious medical problems. How is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) spread? RSV spreads from person to person through: The air by coughing and sneezing Direct contact, such as kissing the face of a child who has RSV Touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands People who have an RSV infection are usually contagious for 3 to 8 days. But sometimes infants and people with weakened immune systems can continue to spread the virus for as long as 4 weeks. Who is at risk for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections? RSV can affect people of all ages. But it is very common in small children; nearly all children become infected with RSV by age 2. In the United States, RSV infections usually occur during RSV season, which is usually fall through spring. Certain people are at higher risk of having a severe RSV infection: Infants Older adults, especially those ages 65 and older People with chronic medical conditions such as heart or lung disease People with weakened immune systems What are the symptoms of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections? The symptoms of RSV infection usually start about 4 to 6 days after infection. They include: Runny nose Decrease in appetite Cough Sneezing Fever Wheezing These symptoms usually appear in stages instead of all at once. In very young infants, the only symptoms may be irritability, decreased activity, and trouble breathing. RSV can also cause more severe infections, especially in people at high risk. These infections include bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the small airways in the lung, and pneumonia , an infection of the lungs. How are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, including asking about symptoms. A physical exam. A lab test of nasal fluid or another respiratory specimen to check for RSV. This is usually done for people with severe infection. Tests to check for complications in people with severe infection. The tests may include a chest x-ray and blood and urine tests. What are the treatments for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections? There is no specific treatment for RSV infection. Most infections go away on their own in a week or two. Over-the-counter pain relievers can help with the fever and pain. However, do not give aspirin to children. And do not give cough medicine to children under four. It is also important to get enough fluids to prevent dehydration . Some people with severe infection may need to be hospitalized. There, they might get oxygen , a breathing tube, or a ventilator. Can respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections be prevented? There are some vaccines to protect against RVS illness. Two of them are for people ages 60 and older. If you are in this age group, talk to your provider about whether an RSV vaccine would be right for you. If you are pregnant, there is a vaccine that is available to give between 32 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. It helps protect their newborn babies from RSV illness for the first 6 months of life. There are two medicines to help prevent severe RSV illness in babies and young children. These medicines may help prevent severe RSV illness, but they can't cure or treat children who already have RSV. And they cannot prevent an RSV infection. Both medicines are given by injections (shots). One medicine is given to infants who are younger than 8 months during their first RSV season. This includes infants who are born during RSV season. This medicine may also be given to some children between the ages of 8 and 19 months who are at high risk for severe RSV illness. For example, they might be at high risk because they: Were born prematurely Have congenital heart disease Have chronic lung disease Have a weakened immune system The other medicine is given monthly during RSV season. It is for children under 24 months of age who are at high risk for severe RSV illness. There are also some steps you can take to lower your risk of getting or spreading an RSV infection, including: Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Avoiding touching your face, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands Avoiding close contact, such as kissing, shaking hands, and sharing cups and eating utensils, with others if you are sick or they are sick Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue.

Reye Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/reyesyndrome.html,"Reye syndrome is a rare illness that can affect the blood, liver, and brain of someone who has recently had a viral infection. It always follows another illness. Although it mostly affects children and teens, anyone can get it. It can develop quickly and without warning. It is most common during flu season. Symptoms include: Nausea and vomiting Listlessness Personality change - such as irritability, combativeness or confusion Delirium Convulsions Loss of consciousness If these symptoms occur soon after a viral illness, seek medical attention immediately. Reye syndrome can lead to a coma and brain death, so quick diagnosis and treatment are critical. Treatment focuses on preventing brain damage.  There is no cure. The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown. Studies have shown that taking aspirin increases the risk of getting it. Because of that, health care professionals now recommend other pain relievers for young patients. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",MedlinePlus
Rh Incompatibility,https://medlineplus.gov/rhincompatibility.html,"There are four major blood types: A, B, O, and AB. The types are based on substances on the surface of the blood cells. Another blood type is called Rh. Rh factor is a protein on red blood cells.  Most people are Rh-positive; they have Rh factor.  Rh-negative people don't have it.  Rh factor is inherited through genes. When you're pregnant , blood from your baby can cross into your bloodstream, especially during delivery. If you're Rh-negative and your baby is Rh-positive, your body will react to the baby's blood as a foreign substance.  It will create antibodies (proteins) against the baby's blood. These antibodies usually don't cause problems during a first pregnancy. But Rh incompatibility may cause problems in later pregnancies, if the baby is Rh-positive. This is because the antibodies stay in your body once they have formed.  The antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells.  The baby could get Rh disease, a serious condition that can cause a serious type of anemia. Blood tests can tell whether you have Rh factor and whether your body has made antibodies. Injections of a medicine called Rh immune globulin can keep your body from making Rh antibodies. It helps prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility.  If treatment is needed for the baby, it can include supplements to help the body to make red blood cells and blood transfusions . NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Rheumatoid Arthritis,https://medlineplus.gov/rheumatoidarthritis.html,"What is rheumatoid arthritis? Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a form of arthritis that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness in your joints. RA is an autoimmune disease . Although it is most common in the wrist and fingers, this disease can cause your immune system to attack any joint tissue. The inflammation (swelling) that comes with RA can also affect other body parts. Inflammation could cause medical issues in your eyes, skin, heart, nerves, blood, or lungs. RA differs from osteoarthritis , a common arthritis that often comes with age. RA affects the lining of your joints and damages the tissue that covers the ends of the bones in a joint. Eventually, this might cause your joints to not work as well. There is no cure for RA, but early treatment can help you manage symptoms, reduce joint damage, and lead a productive life. Who is more likely to get rheumatoid arthritis? Rheumatoid arthritis can happen at any age, but your risk increases as you become an older adult . Your chance of developing RA can also increase if: You're a woman. Women are more likely to get RA than men. You have a family history. If a member of your family has RA, you're more likely to get the disease. You're a smoker. Smoking over a long period of time increases your risk of getting RA and how serious the disease can be. You have other medical conditions that may increase your risk of getting RA. These include obesity , gum disease , and lung disease . What causes rheumatoid arthritis? No one knows what causes rheumatoid arthritis. A few things that might play a part in getting RA include: Your genes are parts of DNA in your cells that are passed down from your parents. Certain genes may increase your risk of getting rheumatoid arthritis, but not everyone with these genes gets RA. The environment , which includes things such as cigarette smoke, sometimes triggers RA symptoms. Hormones are chemical messengers in your bloodstream that control the actions of certain cells or organs. Researchers think that sex hormones might play a role in getting RA. Women are more likely to develop the disease, and RA symptoms may change during and after pregnancy. What are the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis? Your immune system may start turning against your body's joints and tissues years before you notice any symptoms of RA. The changes from this type of immune malfunction usually settle in your joints. RA affects people differently. You might have the disease for only a short time, or your symptoms might come and go. The severe form can be chronic (long-lasting) and may last a lifetime. Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: Joint pain or stiffness when moving. This is usually worse in the morning or after inactivity. RA usually affects both joints. If one of your hands or knees is affected, so is the other. Joint tenderness, redness, and warmth. Joint swelling may make daily activities hard. These could include things such as combing your hair, buttoning your clothes, or bending your knees. Fatigue , fever , and a loss of appetite. Hard bumps (rheumatoid nodules) under your skin near the joints. How is rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed? There's no single test for rheumatoid arthritis. The disease develops over time. At first, you may only have a few symptoms, making it hard to diagnose RA in its early stages. To find out if you have RA, your health care provider may: Ask about your medical history , including your symptoms. Ask about your family health history , including relatives who have had RA. Do a physical exam , which includes checking your joints, looking for rashes or nodules, and listening to your chest for signs of inflammation in your lungs. Order blood tests or imaging studies (x-ray or ultrasound) to make sure other health conditions aren't causing your symptoms since they may be like other types of arthritis and joint conditions. Your provider may refer you to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in arthritis care) for tests, diagnosis, and care. What are the treatments for rheumatoid arthritis? There is no cure for RA, but early treatment can help prevent your symptoms from getting worse and damaging your joints. Treatment can include medicine, lifestyle changes, and surgery. These may slow or stop joint damage and reduce pain and swelling. Your provider may use a combination of treatments. Your treatment may change based on your symptoms. You can help manage your RA symptoms if you: Are physically active Keep a healthy weight Avoid injuries to your joints Avoid activities that have repetitive motions, like bending your knee over and over Stop smoking , or don't start NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases",MedlinePlus

Rotator Cuff Injuries,https://medlineplus.gov/rotatorcuffinjuries.html,"What is a rotator cuff? Your rotator cuff is part of your shoulder joint . It's a group of muscles and tendons that holds the top part of your upper arm bone firmly in your shoulder socket. The rotator cuff keeps your shoulder stable when you move your arm in any direction. What are rotator cuff injuries? Rotator cuff injuries are common. Most of them are wear-and-tear injuries from doing the same arm movements over and over - especially reaching over your head. With time, the tissues in the rotator cuff break down, leading to these injuries: Tendinitis . The tendons in the rotator cuff connect your muscles to your shoulder bones. In tendinitis, the tendons become irritated and swollen from being pinched during shoulder movements. Bursitis . The bursa is a small, fluid-filled sac that pads the space between the rotator cuff and the bones of your shoulder. Bursitis happens when the muscle and bone rub the bursa too much. It swells with extra fluid, which causes pain Rotator cuff tears. Tears in a rotator cuff tendon can happen over time or suddenly from an injury, such as falling on an outstretched arm or lifting something heavy. A tear may go part way through a tendon (partial tear) or all the way through (full tear). Who is more likely to develop a rotator cuff injury? Anyone can develop a rotator cuff injury. But certain people are more likely to have one: People over age 40. Most rotator cuff injuries are from the wear and tear of aging. By age 80, most adults have tears. Athletes. Playing sports with repeated shoulder movements increases the risk of a rotator cuff injury, for example, tennis, swimming, and baseball - especially pitching. People in jobs that require a lot of reaching overhead or heavy lifting. Carpenters, construction workers, and painters are examples of workers who may be more likely to have rotator cuff problems. What are the symptoms of rotator cuff injuries? Rotator cuff injuries don't always cause pain.  But when they do, the pain is often in the top part of your arm or shoulder. You may feel more pain when you: Lie down, especially on the injured shoulder Lift your arm or lower it to the front or side Reach behind your back Other symptoms from a torn rotator cuff may include: Loss of strength in the arm Clicking or popping sounds when you move your arm How are rotator cuff injuries diagnosed? To find out if you have a rotator cuff injury, your health care provider: Will examine your shoulder. This includes checking the range of motion and where the pain is. Will test your arm and shoulder strength. May order imaging tests , such as x-rays , an ultrasound , or an MRI scan . What are the treatments for rotator cuff injuries? The best treatment for you depends on your age, how much your injury bothers you, and whether your injury was sudden or happened from wear and tear. Treatments for rotator cuff injuries often include: Rest Putting ice or a cold pack on the sore area Pain relievers to lessen pain and swelling, such as ibuprofen or aspirin Physical therapy exercises to strengthen your shoulder and improve movement A corticosteroid shot into your shoulder joint if other treatments don't help with the pain Treatments for rotator cuff tendinitis and bursitis may also include ultrasound therapy. Surgery may be an option if your shoulder doesn't feel better in 6 to 12 months. Treatments for a torn rotator cuff may also include heat to the sore area or electrical stimulation of the nerves and muscles (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, TENS). You provider may suggest surgery if your tear is large or is from a recent injury, or symptoms last for 6 to 12 months. When should I see a health care provider for shoulder pain? If certain activities bother your shoulder, it's best to stop doing them and check with your provider. That's because early treatment can prevent mild rotator cuff injuries from becoming more serious later on. If you your arm feels weak right after a sudden injury to your shoulder, see your provider as soon as possible.",MedlinePlus

You may enjoy having access to big, open spaces for recreation. Rural areas are less crowded and can offer more privacy. You may choose a rural area so that you can live near your family and friends. But there are also challenges to living in a rural area, including when it comes to taking care of your health.  Compared to urban areas, rural communities tend to have: Higher poverty rates. A higher percentage of older adults, who are more likely to have chronic health problems. More residents without health insurance. Less access to health care. For example, clinics and hospitals may be far away. Higher rates of certain substance use, such as cigarette smoking and opioid and methamphetamine misuse. Higher rates of chronic health problems such as high blood pressure and obesity . More exposure to environmental hazards, such as chemicals used for farming. There are solutions to deal with these problems. A few examples include: Clinics offering telehealth to provide care for people who live far away from specialists or can't easily get to their providers' offices.

Safe Opioid Use,https://medlineplus.gov/safeopioiduse.html,"What are opioids? Opioids, sometimes called narcotics, are a type of drug. They include strong prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. A health care provider may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some providers prescribe them for chronic pain . Prescription opioids used for pain relief are generally safe when taken for a short time and as prescribed by your provider. However, people who take opioids are at risk for opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose . These risks increase when opioids are misused. Misuse can include taking more than your prescribed dose or taking it more often, using it to get high, or taking someone else's opioids. How do I know if I need to take opioid medicines? First, you need to talk with your provider about whether you need to take opioids. You should discuss: Whether there are other medicines or therapies that might treat your pain The risks and benefits of taking opioids Your medical history and if you or anyone in your family has a history of substance misuse, a drug addiction , or alcohol use disorder (AUD) Any other medicines and supplements you are taking How much alcohol you drink If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant What do I need to know if I am going to take opioid medicines? If you and your provider decide that you need to take opioids, make sure that you understand: How to take the medicine - how much and how often. How long you will need to take the medicine. What the possible side effects are. How you should stop the medicines when you no longer need them. If you have been taking opioids for a while, it can be dangerous to just stop suddenly. You may need to get off the medicines slowly. What the warning signs of addiction are, so you can watch for them. They include: Regularly taking more medicine than you are supposed to Taking someone else's opioids Taking the medicine to get high Mood swings, depression, and/or anxiety Needing too much or too little sleep Trouble making decisions Feeling high or sedated If you have a high risk for an overdose, you will want to get naloxone from a pharmacy and carry it with with you wherever you go. Naloxone is a medicine that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. How can I take my opioid medicine safely? You should always be careful when taking any medicine, but you need to take extra care when taking opioids: Take your medicine exactly as prescribed - do not take extra doses. Check the instructions every time you take a dose. Do not break, chew, crush, or dissolve opioid pills. Opioids can cause drowsiness. Do not drive or use any machinery that may injure you, especially when you first start the medicine. Contact your provider if you have side effects. If you can, use the same pharmacy for all your medicines. The pharmacy's computer system will alert the pharmacist if you are taking two or more medicines that could cause a dangerous interaction. How can I safely store and dispose opioid medicines? It is important to store and dispose of opioid medicines properly: Store your opioids and other medicines in a safe place. If you have children at home, it's a good idea to store your medicines in a lockbox. Even one accidental dose of an opioid pain medicine meant for an adult can cause a fatal overdose in a child. Also, someone who lives with you or visits your house may look for and steal your opioid medicines to take or sell them. If you travel, carry the current bottle of opioids with you for safety. This will help you answer any questions about your medicine. Dispose of your unused medicine properly. If you have unused opioid medicines at the end of your treatment, you can get rid of them by: Finding a local drug take-back program Finding a pharmacy mail-back program In some cases, flushing them down the toilet - check the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) web site to find out which ones you can flush away Never sell or share your medicines.

These lumps are called granulomas. They can form in any organ in the body. But they most commonly affect the lungs and lymph nodes in the chest. Over time, sarcoidosis can cause permanent scarring of organs. What causes sarcoidosis? Your immune system creates inflammation to help defend you against germs and sickness. But in sarcoidosis, inflammation goes off track. It causes the cells in your immune system to form granulomas. Studies suggest that this inflammation might be triggered by infections and certain substances in the environment such as insecticides and mold . And your genes may affect how your immune system reacts to a trigger. Who is more likely to develop sarcoidosis? Anyone can develop sarcoidosis, but you are more likely to have it if you: Are older, especially if you are over age 55 Live or work near insecticides, mold, or other substances that may cause inflammation Have a close relative who has sarcoidosis Take certain medicines, such as some types of HIV medicines and monoclonal antibodies Are of African or Scandinavian descent Are female What are the symptoms of sarcoidosis? Many people who have sarcoidosis have no symptoms, or they may feel unwell but without any obvious symptoms. If you have symptoms, you may have some general symptoms.

The symptoms of Lofgren's syndrome may include: Swollen lymph nodes in your chest, neck, chin, armpits, or groin. A rash of small, itchy, or painful bumps called erythema nodosum. The rash is most often on your head, neck, or legs. Blurred vision, eye pain or redness, light sensitivity, or watery eyes. Joint pain, stiffness, or swelling. Fever. What other problems can sarcoidosis cause? If untreated, or if the treatment does not work, sarcoidosis can cause serious health problems called complications. Possible complications include: Lung problems Heart problems Hormone problems Brain , nerve, or muscle problems Kidney problems Severe organ damage How is sarcoidosis diagnosed? There is no single test that can diagnose sarcoidosis, and its symptoms can be similar to the symptoms of many other conditions. That makes it hard to diagnose. To find out if you have sarcoidosis, your health care provider: Will ask about your medical history, including your symptoms, lifestyle, and any other health conditions you may have. Will do a physical exam, which may include: Checking your temperature Checking to see if your lymph nodes, spleen, or liver are swollen Listening to your chest with a stethoscope as you breathe in and out Looking for rashes or sores on your body, such as scalp and lower legs Will likely order various tests, such as: Chest x-rays A biopsy of the skin, lymph nodes, lungs, or other affected organs Blood tests to check your blood counts , hormone levels, and how well your kidneys are working Other imaging tests If you are diagnosed with sarcoidosis, your provider may order other tests to look at how sarcoidosis is affecting the body. What are the treatments for sarcoidosis? There is no cure for sarcoidosis. The goal of treatment for sarcoidosis is remission, which means you still have the condition, but it does not cause you problems. You may not need treatment, and sometimes the condition goes away on its own. If you do need treatment, which treatment(s) you get will depend on your symptoms, which organs are affected, and whether those organs are working well. You may be given medicines to: Lower inflammation Treat an overactive immune response Treat joint pain Treat skin problems If you have complications from sarcoidosis, you may need other treatments, such as other medicines, surgery, oxygen therapy , pulmonary rehabilitation , or an implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator .

This is called morphea. Lines of thickened or different colored skin that run down your arm, leg, and, rarely, on the forehead. This is called linear scleroderma. Systemic scleroderma can cause problems with your internal organs as well as your skin. It can cause symptoms such as: Thick, tight skin on your fingers Fatigue Raynaud's phenomenon , a narrowing of blood vessels in the hands or feet Damage to your internal organs, including your digestive system , lungs, kidneys, and heart How is scleroderma diagnosed? There is no single test for scleroderma. The symptoms can vary from person to person and can be similar to those of other diseases. This can make scleroderma hard to diagnose. To find out if you have scleroderma, your health care provider: Will ask about your symptoms and medical history Will do a physical exam May order blood tests, including an ANA (antinuclear antibody) test May do a skin biopsy May do other tests, such as imaging tests , to check for organ damage What are the treatments for scleroderma? There is no cure for scleroderma, but treatments can help control your symptoms and limit damage. The treatments may include: Medicines to help decrease swelling, manage pain , control other symptoms, and prevent complications. Physical or occupational therapy to help with pain, improve muscle strength, and teach you ways to help with daily living. Regular dental care, because scleroderma can make your mouth dry and damage connective tissues in your mouth. These problems can speed up tooth decay and cause your teeth to become loose. You may need to see specialists to help treat your disease. Many people with scleroderma will see a rheumatologist. This is a doctor who specializes in rheumatic diseases such as arthritis and other inflammatory or autoimmune disorders. Dermatologists, who specialize in conditions of the skin, hair, and nails, may also play an important role in treating the disease. And if you have organ damage, you may need to see other specialists. You can also help manage some of your symptoms, for example by: Dressing warm and avoiding cold or wet environments Quitting smoking (if you smoke) Putting on sunscreen before you go outdoors Using moisturizers on your skin to help lessen stiffness Avoiding hot baths and showers, harsh soaps, and household cleaners Getting regular physical activity NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases",MedlinePlus
Scoliosis,https://medlineplus.gov/scoliosis.html,"Scoliosis causes a sideways curve of your backbone, or spine. These curves are often S- or C-shaped.  Scoliosis is most common in late childhood and the early teens, when children grow fast. Girls are more likely to have it than boys. It can run in families. Symptoms include leaning to one side and having uneven shoulders and hips. Sometimes it is easy to notice, but not always. Children may get screening for scoliosis at school or during a checkup . If it looks like there is a problem, your doctor will use your medical and family history, a physical exam, and imaging tests to make a diagnosis. Treatment depends on your age, how much more you're likely to grow, how much curving there is, and whether the curve is temporary or permanent. People with mild scoliosis might only need checkups to see if the curve is getting worse. Others might need to wear a brace or have surgery.

Seasonal Affective Disorder,https://medlineplus.gov/seasonalaffectivedisorder.html,"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that comes and goes with the seasons. It usually starts in the late fall and early winter and goes away during the spring and summer. Some people do have episodes of depression that start in the spring or summer, but that is a lot less common. Symptoms of SAD may include: Sadness Gloomy outlook Feeling hopeless, worthless, and irritable Loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy Low energy Difficulty sleeping or oversleeping Carbohydrate cravings and weight gain Thoughts of death or suicide SAD is more common in women, young people, and those who live far from the equator. You are also more likely to have SAD if you or your family members have depression. The exact causes of SAD are unknown. Researchers have found that people with SAD may have an imbalance of serotonin, a brain chemical that affects your mood. Their bodies also make too much melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep, and not enough vitamin D. The main treatment for SAD is light therapy. The idea behind light therapy is to replace the sunshine that you miss during the fall and winter months. You sit in front of a light therapy box every morning to get daily exposure to bright, artificial light. But some people with SAD do not respond to light therapy alone. Antidepressant medicines and talk therapy can reduce SAD symptoms, either alone or combined with light therapy. NIH: National Institute of Mental Health",MedlinePlus

Without quick treatment, it can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and even death. What causes sepsis? Sepsis happens when an infection you already have triggers a chain reaction throughout your body. Bacterial infections are the most common cause, but other types of infections can also cause it. The infections are often in the lungs, stomach, kidneys, or bladder. It's possible for sepsis to begin with a small cut that gets infected or with an infection that develops after surgery. Sometimes, sepsis can occur in people who didn't even know that they had an infection. Who is more likely to develop sepsis? Anyone with an infection could get sepsis. But certain people are more likely to develop it: Adults 65 or older People with chronic (long-lasting) conditions, such as diabetes , lung disease , cancer , and kidney disease People with weakened immune systems Pregnant women Children younger than one What are the symptoms of sepsis? Sepsis can cause one or more of these symptoms: Rapid breathing and heart rate Shortness of breath Confusion or disorientation Extreme pain or discomfort Fever , shivering, or feeling very cold Clammy or sweaty skin It's important to get medical care right away if you think you might have sepsis or if your infection is not getting better or is getting worse.

Sexually Transmitted Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/sexuallytransmittedinfections.html,"What are sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), are infections that are passed from one person to another through sexual contact. They are usually spread during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. But sometimes they can spread through other sexual contact involving the penis, vagina, mouth, or anus. This is because some STIs, like herpes and HPV, are spread by skin-to-skin contact. Some STIs can be passed to the fetus during pregnancy or during childbirth. Other ways that some STIs may be spread include during breastfeeding , through blood transfusions , or by sharing needles. There are more than 20 types of STIs, including: Chlamydia Genital herpes Gonorrhea HIV HPV Pubic lice Syphilis Trichomoniasis What causes sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? STIs can be caused by bacteria , viruses , and parasites . Who is affected by sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? Most STIs affect both men and women, but in many cases the health problems they cause can be more severe for 
women. If an STI is passed to a baby, it can cause serious health problems. What are the symptoms of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? STIs don't always cause symptoms or may only cause mild symptoms. So it is possible to have an infection and not know it. And even without symptoms, STIs can still be harmful and may be passed on during sex. If there are symptoms, they could include: Unusual discharge from the penis or vagina Sores or warts on the genital area Painful or frequent urination (peeing) Itching and redness in the genital area Blisters or sores in or around the mouth Abnormal vaginal odor Anal itching, soreness, or bleeding Abdominal (belly) pain Fever How are sexually transmitted infections (STIs) diagnosed? If you are sexually active, you should talk to your health care provider about your risk for STIs and whether you need to be tested. This is especially important since many STIs do not usually cause symptoms. Some STIs may be diagnosed during a physical exam or through STI testing . Some tests involve a microscopic examination of a sore or fluid swabbed from the vagina, penis, or anus. Blood tests can diagnose other types of STIs. What are the treatments for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? Antibiotics can treat STIs that are caused by bacteria or parasites. There is no cure for STIs caused by viruses, but antiviral medicines can often help with the symptoms and lower your risk of spreading the infection. It's important to get treatment if you have an STI. Some types of STIs can cause serious health problems if they are not treated. Can sexually transmitted infections (STIs) be prevented? The surest way to protect yourself against STIs is to not have sex. If you do decide to have sex, you can lower your risk of getting an STI by: Having you and your partner tested for STIs before having sex. Using a condom every time you have sex. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading STIs. If your or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. Reducing your number of sex partners. You might even consider ""mutual monogamy"" with just one partner. This means that you agree to be sexually active only with them, and they agree to be sexually active only with you. But first you should both get tested to make sure that you don't already have an STI. Getting vaccinated against HPV and hepatitis B .",MedlinePlus
Shingles,https://medlineplus.gov/shingles.html,"What is shingles? Shingles (herpes zoster) is an infection that causes a painful rash. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). This is the same virus that causes chickenpox . After you have chickenpox, the virus stays in your body. It may not cause problems for many years. But as you get older, the virus may become active again and cause shingles. Is shingles contagious? Shingles is not contagious. You cannot get shingles from someone else. But you can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles if you have direct contact with fluid from their shingles rash. The risk of spreading the virus is low if the shingles rash is kept covered. People with shingles cannot spread the virus before their rash blisters appear or after the rash crusts. Who is at risk for shingles? Anyone who has had chickenpox can get shingles. But the risk of shingles goes up as you get older. Shingles is most common in people over age 50. People with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of getting shingles. This includes those who: Have immune system diseases such as HIV Have certain cancers Take medicines that weaken their immune system, such as steroids and medicines you take after organ transplant Your immune system may be weaker when you have an infection or are stressed. This can raise your risk of shingles. It is rare, but possible, to get shingles more than once. What are the symptoms of shingles? Early signs of shingles include burning or shooting pain and tingling or itching. It is usually on one side of the body or face. The pain can be mild to severe. Up to several days later, you will get a rash. It consists of blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days. The rash is usually a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash is only on one side of the face. In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread. It might look similar to a chickenpox rash. Some people may also have other symptoms: Fever Headache Chills Upset stomach What other problems can shingles cause? Shingles can cause other problems (complications): Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is most common complication of shingles. It causes severe pain in the areas where you had the shingles rash. It usually gets better in a few weeks or months. But some people can have pain from PHN for many years, and it can interfere with daily life. Vision loss can happen if shingles affects your eye. It may be temporary or permanent. Hearing or balance problems are possible if you have shingles within or near your ear. You may also have weakness of the muscles on that side of your face. These problems can be temporary or permanent. Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia , brain inflammation ( encephalitis ), or death. How is shingles diagnosed? Usually your health care provider can diagnose shingles by taking your medical history and looking at your rash. In some cases, your provider may scrap off tissue from the rash or swab some fluid from the blisters and send the sample to a lab for testing. What are the treatments for shingles? There is no cure for shingles. Antiviral medicines may help to make the attack shorter and less severe. They may also help prevent PHN. The medicines are most effective if you can take them within 3 days after the rash appears. So if you think you might have shingles, contact your provider as soon as possible. Pain relievers may also help with the pain. A cool washcloth, calamine lotion, and oatmeal baths may help relieve some of the itching. Can shingles be prevented? There is a vaccine, called Shingrix, to help prevent shingles and its complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that healthy adults 50 years and older get the vaccine. Your provider might also recommend the vaccine if you are over 19 and have a weakened immune system. The vaccine is given in two doses. If you have shingles, you can help prevent spreading the virus to others by: Staying away from: People with weakened immune systems People who have not had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine, especially if they are pregnant Premature or low birth weight babies Keeping the rash covered Not touching or scratching the rash Washing your hands often Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus

Shoulder Injuries and Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/shoulderinjuriesanddisorders.html,"Your shoulder joint is composed of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone). Your shoulders are the most movable joints in your body. They can also be unstable because the ball of the upper arm is larger than the shoulder socket that holds it. To remain in a stable or normal position, the shoulder must be anchored by muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Because your shoulder can be unstable, it can be easily injured. Common problems include: Sprains and strains Dislocations Separations Tendinitis Bursitis Torn rotator cuffs Frozen shoulder Fractures (broken bones) Arthritis Health care providers diagnose shoulder problems by using your medical history, a physical exam, and imaging tests.

Sickle Cell Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/sicklecelldisease.html,"What is sickle cell disease (SCD)? Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. If you have SCD, there is a problem with your hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. With SCD, the hemoglobin forms into stiff rods within the red blood cells. This changes the shape of the red blood cells. The cells are supposed to be disc-shaped, but instead they are crescent, or sickle, shaped. The sickle-shaped cells are not flexible and cannot change shape easily. Many of them burst apart as they move through your blood vessels. The sickle cells usually only last 10 to 20 days, instead of the normal 90 to 120 days. Your body may have trouble making enough new cells to replace the ones that you lost. Because of this, you may not have enough red blood cells. This is a condition called anemia , and it can make you feel tired. The sickle-shaped cells can also stick to vessel walls, causing a blockage that slows or stops the flow of blood. When this happens, oxygen can't reach nearby tissues. The lack of oxygen can cause attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain crises. These attacks can occur without warning. If you get one, you might need to go to the hospital for treatment. What causes sickle cell disease (SCD)? SCD is caused by a variant (change) in a gene that has instructions for your body to make one part of the hemoglobin. This changed gene is sometimes called a sickle cell gene. People with SCD are born with two sickle cell genes, one from each parent. If you are born with one sickle cell gene, it's called sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait are generally healthy, but they can pass the defective gene on to their children. Who is more likely to have sickle cell disease (SCD)? In the United States, most of the people with SCD are African Americans: About 1 in 13 Black or African American babies are born with sickle cell trait About 1 in every 365 Black or African American babies are born with sickle cell disease SCD also affects some people who come from Hispanic, southern European, Middle Eastern, or Asian Indian backgrounds. What are the symptoms of sickle cell disease (SCD)? People with SCD start to have signs of the disease during the first year of life, usually around 5 or 6 months of age. Early symptoms of SCD may include: Painful swelling of the hands and feet Fatigue or fussiness from anemia A yellowish color of the skin ( jaundice ) or the whites of the eyes (icterus) The effects of SCD vary from person to person and can change over time. Most of the signs and symptoms of SCD are related to complications of the disease. They may include severe pain, anemia, organ damage, and infections. How is sickle cell disease (SCD) diagnosed? A blood test can show if you have SCD or sickle cell trait. Genetic tests can tell if you have one or two copies of the sickle cell gene. Genetic tests can help confirm an SCD diagnosis if the results from blood tests are not clear. All states now test newborns for SCD (as well as many other treatable conditions) as part of their screening programs . These programs help find the conditions early, so treatment can be started right away. Health care providers can also diagnose SCD before a baby is born. That test uses a sample of amniotic fluid (the liquid in the sac surrounding the baby) or tissue taken from the placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby). People who are thinking about having children can have the test to find out how likely it is that their children will have SCD. What are the treatments for sickle cell disease (SCD)? There are many ways to manage sickle cell disease. Your medical team will probably include a hematologist, a doctor who specializes in blood diseases. You will work with your medical team to set up a treatment plan. Possible treatment options may include: Treatments that can help relieve symptoms and lessen complications, including: Hydroxyurea, a medicine to reduce sickling of red blood cells. This can help prevent serious symptoms of sickle cell disease. This medicine can be used in adults and in children as young as 9 months old.  But this medicine is not safe during pregnancy. Voxelotor, another medicine to prevent the sickling of red blood cells. It can be used in adults and children ages 4 years and older. Pain relievers for acute or chronic pain. Antibiotics to try to prevent infections in younger children. Blood transfusions for severe anemia. If you have had some serious complications, such as a stroke , you may have transfusions to prevent more complications. Other treatments for specific complications, such as medicines to lower blood pressure and vitamins to treat a vitamin deficiency. Bone marrow or stem cell transplantation, which can cure SCD. Because these transplants are risky and can have serious side effects, they are usually only used in children with severe SCD. For the transplant to work, the bone marrow must be a close match. Usually, the best donor is a brother or sister. Gene therapies to treat SCD in people who are 12 years and older and have had repeated sickle cell crises. These new therapies involve taking some of your blood stem cells and either adding new DNA to them or changing their existing DNA. Then these cells are given back to you, and they can make a type of hemoglobin that is healthy. This can reduce the complications of SCD, including the SCD crises. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) seems to help some people deal with pain caused by SCD. These types of CAM may lower your pain, especially if it is not well managed with medicines:: Cognitive behavioral therapy (a type of counseling) Acupuncture Exercise or movement programs, such as yoga Massage Meditation and mindfulness practices Virtual reality, a computer-generated 3D environment you can see with special goggles It's also important to take steps to keep yourself as healthy as possible: Get regular medical care Get your routine vaccinations Live a healthy lifestyle Avoid situations that may set off a pain crisis NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Sinusitis,https://medlineplus.gov/sinusitis.html,"Sinusitis means your sinuses are inflamed. The cause can be an infection or another problem. Your sinuses are hollow air spaces within the bones surrounding the nose. They produce mucus, which drains into the nose.  If your nose is swollen, this can block the sinuses and cause pain. There are several types of sinusitis, including: Acute, which lasts up to 4 weeks Subacute, which lasts 4 to 12 weeks Chronic, which lasts more than 12 weeks and can continue for months or even years Recurrent, with several attacks within a year Acute sinusitis often starts as a cold, which then turns into a bacterial infection.  Allergies, nasal problems, and certain diseases can also cause acute and chronic sinusitis. Symptoms of sinusitis can include fever, weakness, fatigue, cough, and congestion. There may also be mucus drainage in the back of the throat, called postnasal drip. Your health care professional diagnoses sinusitis based on your symptoms and an examination of your nose and face. You may also need imaging tests. Treatments include antibiotics, decongestants, and pain relievers. Using heat pads on the inflamed area, saline nasal sprays, and vaporizers can also help.",MedlinePlus
Sjogren's Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/sjogrenssyndrome.html,"What is Sjogren's syndrome? Sjogren's syndrome, also called Sjogren's disease, is a chronic (long-lasting) autoimmune disease . When you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs by mistake. In Sjogren's syndrome, your immune system attacks the glands that make moisture in the eyes, mouth, and other parts of the body. This causes a dry mouth and dry eyes . You may have dryness in other places that need moisture, such as your nose, throat, and skin. Sjogren's can also affect other parts of the body, including your joints, lungs, kidneys, blood vessels, digestive organs, and nerves. What causes Sjogren's syndrome? Normally, your immune system protects the body from infection and disease. But with Sjogren's syndrome and other autoimmune diseases, your immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs. Researchers don't know for sure what causes the immune system to do this. But they think that it is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Studies have linked Sjogren's syndrome to gene changes in several genes. Some researchers also think that the disease may be triggered by something in the environment. For example, they think that one possible trigger could be a previous infection with a virus or bacteria . Who is more likely to develop Sjogren's syndrome? Most people with Sjogren's syndrome are women. You can get it at any age, but it is most common in people in their 40s and 50s. Sjogren's syndrome is more common in people who have other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus . This is known as a secondary form of Sjogren's syndrome. People who don't have another autoimmune disease have a primary form of Sjogren's syndrome. What are the symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome? Sjogren's syndrome may have different effects on the body. Not everyone will have the same symptoms. Some people have cycles of mild and then severe symptoms. The two main symptoms are: Dry eyes. Your eyes may burn or itch or feel like they have sand in them. Sometimes your vision may be blurry, or you could be bothered by bright lights. Dry mouth. Your tongue and your throat may feel dry. You might have trouble swallowing , speaking , and tasting . Sjogren's syndrome can also affect other parts of the body, causing symptoms such as: Joint and muscle pain Dry skin Rashes on the skin of hands or feet Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet Vaginal dryness Dry cough that doesn't go away Fatigue that doesn't go away How is Sjogren's syndrome diagnosed? There is no single test for Sjogren's syndrome. To find out if you have it, your provider: Will ask about your medical history and symptoms. Will do a physical exam, which includes checking for signs of dry mouth and signs of related autoimmune diseases. May order tests, including: Eye tests to see if you produce a normal amount of tears and to find out if your eyes have been damaged by dryness. Salivary gland tests to measure how much saliva your mouth produces. They could include imaging tests and a biopsy . Blood tests. What are the treatments for Sjogren's syndrome? There is no cure for Sjogren's syndrome. Treatment focuses on relieving your symptoms. The treatments can be different for each person, depending on which parts of the body are affected. They may include: Eye drops (artificial tears) or ointments to relieve dryness in the eyes. Saliva substitutes. Prescription medicines that cause your salivary glands to make more saliva. A minor procedure that places small plugs the tear duct in the corners of the eyes. The plugs block your tears from draining so they stay in your eyes longer. Medicines to help with other symptoms caused by Sjogren's syndrome, such as medicines for pain and inflammation. Medicines that suppress (weaken) your immune system (for severe cases). You can also try to relieve some of your symptoms by sucking on sugar-free candy, drinking water often, increasing the humidity in your room, and not smoking. Because having a dry mouth can raise your risk of cavities, it's important to take good care of your teeth and see your dentist regularly.",MedlinePlus

It is also the cause of nearly one in five deaths in the United States. Some of the many health problems that smoking can cause include: Cancers. Smoking is the most common cause of lung and oral cancers. But it can also cause cancer in many other parts of your body, such as in your larynx (voice box), esophagus , throat , bladder , kidney , liver , stomach , pancreas , colon and rectum , and cervix . It can also cause acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Lung diseases . Smoking is the most common cause of COPD . It can also worsen asthma and raise your risk of pneumonia . Cardiovascular diseases. Smoking can damage your blood vessels and make them thicken and grow narrower. This makes your heart  beat faster and raises your blood pressure . Smoking also increases your risk of blood clots and stroke . Vision problems . Smoking can raise your risk of cataracts and cause macular degeneration (AMD). You have a greater chance of certain pregnancy problems if you smoke while pregnant .   Your baby is also at higher risk of dying of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Smoking also causes addiction to nicotine, a stimulant drug that is in tobacco. Nicotine addiction makes it much harder for people to quit smoking . What are the health risks of secondhand smoke? Your smoke is also bad for other people. If they breathe in your secondhand smoke , they can get many of the same problems as smokers do. These problems can include heart disease and lung cancer. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have a higher risk of ear infections , colds , pneumonia, bronchitis, and more severe asthma . If you breathe secondhand smoke while pregnant, you're more likely to have preterm labor and a baby with low birth weight . Are other forms of tobacco also dangerous? Besides cigarettes, there are several other forms of tobacco. Some people smoke tobacco in cigars and water pipes (hookahs). These forms of tobacco also contain harmful chemicals and nicotine. Some cigars contain as much tobacco as an entire pack of cigarettes. E-cigarettes often look like cigarettes, but they work differently. They are battery-operated smoking devices. Using an e-cigarette is called vaping. Researchers still have a lot to learn about the health effects of using e-cigarettes. We do know that they contain nicotine, which is highly addictive and a health danger to you and your fetus if you are pregnant, children, and teens. And e-cigarettes also expose non-smokers to secondhand aerosols (rather than secondhand smoke), which contain harmful chemicals. Smokeless tobacco , such as chewing tobacco and snuff, is also bad for your health. Smokeless tobacco can cause certain cancers, including oral cancer. It also increases your risk of getting heart disease, gum disease , and oral lesions. Why should I quit? Remember, there is no safe level of tobacco use. Smoking even just one cigarette per day over a lifetime can cause smoking-related cancers and premature death. Quitting smoking can reduce your risk of health problems and add years to your life.

Spinal Muscular Atrophy,https://medlineplus.gov/spinalmuscularatrophy.html,"What is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)? Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a group of genetic diseases that damages and kills motor neurons. Motor neurons are a type of nerve cell in the spinal cord and lower part of the brain. They control movement in your arms, legs, face, chest, throat, and tongue. As the motor neurons die off, your muscles start to weaken and atrophy (waste away). The muscle damage gets worse over time and can affect speaking, walking, swallowing, and breathing. What are the types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and what are their symptoms? There are different types of SMA. They are based on how serious the disease is and when the symptoms start: Type l is also called Werdnig-Hoffman disease or infantile-onset SMA. It is the most severe type. It is also the most common. Babies with this type usually show signs of the disease before 6 months of age. In more severe cases, the signs show up even before or just after birth (Types 0 or 1A). The babies may have trouble swallowing and breathing and may not move around a lot. They have chronic shortening of muscles or tendons (called contractures). They usually cannot sit up without help. Without treatment, many children with this type will die before 2 years of age. Type ll is a moderate to severe type of SMA. It usually first noticed between 6 and 18 months of age. Most children with this type can sit without support but cannot stand or walk without help. They may also have trouble breathing. They can usually live into adolescence or young adulthood. Type lll is also called Kugelberg-Welander disease. It is the mildest type that affects children. The signs of the disease usually show up after age 18 months. Children with this type can walk by themselves but may have trouble running, getting up from a chair, or climbing stairs. They may also have scoliosis (curvature of the spine), contractures, and respiratory infections. With treatment, most children with this type will have a normal lifespan. Type IV is rare and often mild. It usually causes symptoms after 21 years of age. The symptoms include mild to moderate leg muscle weakness, tremors , and mild breathing problems. The symptoms slowly get worse over time. People with this type of SMA have a normal lifespan. What causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)? Most types of SMA are caused by a change in the SMN1 gene . This gene is responsible for making a protein that the motor neurons need to be healthy and to function. But when part of the SMN1 gene is missing or abnormal, there isn't enough protein for the motor neurons. This causes the motor neurons to die off. Most people have two copies of the SM1 gene - one from each parent. SMA normally only happens when both copies have the gene change. If only one copy has the change, there usually aren't any symptoms. But that gene could be passed down from parent to child. Some of the less common types of SMA may be caused by changes in other genes. How is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose SMA: A physical exam A medical history, including asking about family history Genetic testing to check for the gene changes that cause SMA Electromyography and nerve conduction studies and a muscle biopsy may be done, especially if no gene changes were found Parents who have a family history of SMA may want to do a prenatal test to check to see whether their baby has an SMN1 gene change. An amniocentesis or in some cases a chorionic villi sampling (CVS) is used to get the sample for testing. In some states, genetic testing for SMA is part of newborn screening tests . What are the treatments for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)? There is no cure for SMA. Treatments can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. They may include: Medicines to help the body make more of the proteins that the motor neurons need Gene therapy for children under 2 years of age Physical, occupational, and rehabilitation therapy to help to improve posture and the mobility of the joints. These therapies may also improve blood flow and slow muscle weakness and atrophy. Some people may also need therapy for trouble speaking , chewing, and swallowing. Assistive devices such as supports or braces, orthotics, speech synthesizers, and wheelchairs to help people stay more independent Good nutrition and a balanced diet to help maintain weight and strength. Some people might need a feeding tube in order to get the nutrition they need. Breathing support for people who have muscle weakness in the neck, throat, and chest. The support may include devices to help with breathing during the day and to prevent sleep apnea at night. Some people might need to be on a ventilator.

Spinal Stenosis,https://medlineplus.gov/spinalstenosis.html,"Your spine, or backbone, protects your spinal cord and allows you to stand and bend. Spinal stenosis causes narrowing in your spine. The narrowing puts pressure on your nerves and spinal cord and can cause pain. Spinal stenosis occurs mostly in people older than 50. Younger people with a spine injury or a narrow spinal canal are also at risk. Diseases such as arthritis and scoliosis can cause spinal stenosis, too. Symptoms might appear gradually or not at all. They include: Pain in your neck or back Numbness, weakness, cramping, or pain in your arms or legs Pain going down the leg Foot problems Doctors diagnose spinal stenosis with a physical exam and imaging tests.

Staphylococcal Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/staphylococcalinfections.html,"What are Staphylococcal (staph) infections? Staphylococcus (staph) is a group of bacteria. There are more than 30 types. A type called Staphylococcus aureus causes most infections. Staph bacteria can cause many different types of infections, including: Skin infections , which are the most common types of staph infections. Bacteremia, an infection of the bloodstream. This can lead to sepsis , a very serious immune response to infection. Bone infections . Endocarditis , an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. Food poisoning . Pneumonia . Toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a life-threatening condition caused by toxins from certain types of bacteria. What causes staph infections? Some people carry staph bacteria on their skin or in their noses, but they do not get an infection. But if they get a cut or wound, the bacteria can enter the body and cause an infection. Staph bacteria can spread from person to person. They can also spread on objects, such as towels, clothing, door handles, athletic equipment, and remotes. If you have staph and do not handle food properly when you are preparing it, you can also spread staph to others. Who is more likely to get a staph infection? Anyone can develop a staph infection, but certain people are more likely to get one, including those who: Have a chronic condition such as diabetes , cancer, vascular disease , eczema , and lung disease Have a weakened immune system, such as from HIV , medicines to prevent organ rejection, or chemotherapy Had surgery Are in the hospital Use a catheter, breathing tube, or feeding tube Have an implanted device, such as a pacemaker or artificial joint or heart valve Have burns , especially if they are deep or cover a large area of the body Are on dialysis Inject illegal drugs Do contact sports, since you may have skin-to-skin contact with others or share equipment What are the symptoms of staph infections? The symptoms of a staph infection depend on the type of infection: Skin infections can look like pimples or boils. They may be red, swollen, and painful. Sometimes there is pus or other drainage. They can turn into impetigo , which turns into a crust on the skin, or cellulitis , a swollen, red area of skin that feels hot. Bone infections can cause pain, swelling, warmth, and redness in the infected area. You may also have chills and a fever . Endocarditis causes some flu-like symptoms: fever , chills, and fatigue. It also causes symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and fluid buildup in your arms or legs. Food poisoning typically causes nausea and vomiting , diarrhea , and fever. If you lose too many fluids, you may also become dehydrated . Pneumonia symptoms include a high fever, chills, and cough that doesn't get better. You may also have chest pain and shortness of breath . Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) causes high fever, sudden low blood pressure, vomiting, diarrhea, and confusion. You may have a sunburn-like rash somewhere on your body. TSS can lead to organ failure. How are staph infections diagnosed? Your health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Often, providers can tell if you have a staph skin infection by looking at it. To check for other types of staph infections, providers may do a culture , with a skin scraping, tissue sample, stool sample, or throat or nasal swabs. There may be other tests, such as imaging tests , depending on the type of infection. What are the treatments for staph infections? Treatment for staph infections is antibiotics . Depending on the type of infection, the antibiotics might be a cream, ointment, medicines (to swallow), or intravenous (IV) medicine. If you have an infected wound, your provider might drain it. Sometimes you may need surgery for bone infections. Some staph infections, such as MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), are resistant to many antibiotics . There are still certain antibiotics that can treat these infections. Can staph infections be prevented? Certain steps can help to prevent staph infections: Use good hygiene , including washing your hands often. Don't share towels, sheets, or clothing with someone who has a staph infection. It's best not to share athletic equipment. If you do need to share, make sure that it is properly cleaned and dried before you use it. Practice food safety , including not preparing food for others when you have a staph infection. If you have a cut or wound, keep it covered.",MedlinePlus
Statins,https://medlineplus.gov/statins.html,"What is cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that that's found in all the cells in your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly.  But if you have too much of it in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases . Cholesterol is made by your liver. It travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type of lipoprotein, LDL , is sometimes called the ""bad"" cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Another type, HDL , is sometimes called the ""good"" cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Then your liver removes the cholesterol from your body. What are statins? Statins are a type of cholesterol medicine . Your health care provider may prescribe them if you have high cholesterol and making lifestyle changes does not lower your cholesterol enough. Statins are the most common medicines used to treat high cholesterol. How do statins lower cholesterol? Statins lower LDL cholesterol by slowing down how much cholesterol the liver makes. They also increase your liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol that is already in the blood. This can slow the formation of plaques in your arteries. Studies have shown that statins lower the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with high LDL cholesterol. Statins can lower your triglyceride level as well. Triglycerides are another type of fat in your blood that can raise the risk of heart disease. Statins may also increase your HDL cholesterol. What are the risks of taking statins? Statins usually don't cause side effects , but they may raise the risk of type 2 diabetes . However, this mainly happens in people already at high risk of diabetes, such as those who are overweight or have obesity , prediabetes , or metabolic syndrome . Statins may also cause abnormal results on liver enzymes tests, but actual liver damage is very rare. Another uncommon side effect is muscle damage. In rare cases, this muscle damage can lead to muscle pain and kidney damage. You should not take statins if you are pregnant or breastfeeding . They are also not recommended for people who have certain types of liver disease . How can I safely take statins? To safely take statins, you should: Take your statin as prescribed. You should not stop taking this medicine on your own, since that can lead to a serious problem or, in rare cases, even cause death. Talk to your provider if you have any concerns about your statin or if you would like to stop or change to a different treatment. Ask your provider which other medicines, supplements , or foods you should avoid. Some of these can interact with statins and cause serious side effects or make statins less effective. For example, grapefruit (fresh or as juice) affects how your liver breaks down some statins. Tell your provider about any symptoms or side effects you are having. Sometimes, people report muscle problems while taking statins. If you start having muscle pain, your provider may order a blood test to look look for muscle damage. The pain may go away if you switch to a different statin. Muscle damage with statins is rare, and your muscles may heal when you switch to a different medicine.",MedlinePlus
Stem Cells,https://medlineplus.gov/stemcells.html,"Stem cells are cells with the potential to develop into many different types of cells in the body. They serve as a repair system for the body.

Stress,https://medlineplus.gov/stress.html,"What is stress? Stress is how your brain and body respond to a challenge or demand. When you are stressed, your body releases certain hormones . Hormones are chemicals that travel in your bloodstream and control how different parts of your body work. The hormones that are released when you are stressed make you alert and ready to act. They can raise your blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose (blood sugar) levels. This response is sometimes called a ""fight or flight"" response. Everyone gets stressed from time to time. There are different types of stress. It can be short-term or long-term. It can be caused by something that happens once or something that keeps happening. Not all stress is bad. In fact, it can help you survive in a dangerous situation. For example, one kind of stress is the jolt you may feel when a car pulls out in front of you while you are driving. This jolt of hormones helps you quickly hit the brakes to avoid an accident. A little short-term stress can sometimes be helpful. For example, the stress of having a deadline for school or your job may push you to get your work done on time. Once you finish it, that stress goes away. But stress that lasts a long time can harm your health. What causes long-term stress? Long-term stress, or chronic stress, lasts for weeks, months, or longer. As you go about your life, your body is acting as if you're being threatened. Causes of long-term stress include: Routine stress from the demands of work, school, family needs, money problems, and other daily pressures that don't stop. Stress from sudden, difficult changes in your life, such as divorce, illness, losing your job, or other unhappy life events that often have a long impact. Traumatic stress, which may happen when you're in danger of serious harm or death. Examples include being in a bad accident, a war, a flood, earthquake, or other frightening event. This type of stress can cause a long-lasting problem called post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). How can long term-stress harm my health? People respond to stress in different ways. If you're stressed for a long time you may notice that you are: Getting sick more often than usual because stress weakens your body's ability to fight germs Having stomach problems or trouble digesting food Having trouble sleeping Having headaches Feeling sad, angry, or easily upset When stress keeps going, your body acts as if you're always in danger. That's a lot of strain that may play a part in developing serious health problems, including: Depression Anxiety Heart disease High blood pressure Diabetes It's possible to get used to the symptoms of stress and not even realize there's a problem. So when there's a lot of stress in your life, it's important to pay attention to how it affects you so you can do something about it. How can I manage long-term stress? Simple things that improve your mental health may be helpful in managing long-term stress, such as: Get regular exercise. A 30-minute daily walk can help you feel better and help keep your immune system strong, so you don't get sick. Try relaxing activities. You could look for an app or wellness program that uses breathing, meditation, or muscle relaxation exercises. Get enough sleep every night. Avoid too much caffeine . Decide what you need to do now and what can wait. And focus on what you got done each day, not on what you weren't able to do. Ask your family or friends for support. When should I ask my health care provider for help with stress? Get help if you're having severe symptoms for 2 weeks or more, including: Trouble sleeping Changes in your eating that cause unwanted changes in your weight Troubles getting out of bed because of your mood Difficulty focusing your thoughts Losing interest in things you usually enjoy Not being able to do your usual daily activities Always get help right away if stress is causing you to: Have thoughts of suicide Feel you can't cope Use drugs or alcohol more often than usual Your health care provider may refer you to a mental health professional such as a psychologist or social worker.

Stroke,https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html,"What is a stroke? A stroke happens when there is a loss of blood flow to part of the brain. Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. Immediate treatment may save someone's life and increase the chances for successful rehabilitation and recovery. What are the types of stroke? There are two types of stroke: Ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This is the most common type; about 80% of strokes are ischemic. Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain Another condition that's similar to a stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA). It's sometimes called a ""mini-stroke."" TIAs happen when the blood supply to the brain is blocked for a short time. The damage to the brain cells isn't permanent, but if you have had a TIA, you are at a much higher risk of having a stroke. Who is at risk for a stroke? Certain factors can raise your risk of a stroke. The major risk factors include: High blood pressure . This is the primary risk factor for a stroke. Diabetes . Heart diseases . Atrial fibrillation and other heart diseases can cause blood clots that lead to stroke. Smoking . When you smoke, you damage your blood vessels and raise your blood pressure. A personal or family history of stroke or TIA. Age. Your risk of stroke increases as you get older. Race and ethnicity. African Americans have a higher risk of stroke. There are also other factors that are linked to a higher risk of stroke, such as: Alcohol and illegal drug use Not getting enough physical activity High cholesterol Unhealthy diet Having obesity What are the symptoms of stroke? The symptoms of stroke often happen quickly. They include: Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body) Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or understanding speech Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes Sudden difficulty walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination Sudden severe headache with no known cause If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. How are strokes diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will: Ask about your symptoms and medical history Do a physical exam, including a check of Your mental alertness Your coordination and balance Any numbness or weakness in your face, arms, and legs Any trouble speaking and seeing clearly Run some tests, which may include Diagnostic imaging of the brain, such as a CT scan or MRI Heart tests , which can help detect heart problems or blood clots that may have led to a stroke. Possible tests include an electrocardiogram (EKG) and an echocardiography. What are the treatments for stroke? Treatments for stroke include medicines, surgery, and rehabilitation. Which treatments you get depend on the type of stroke and the stage of treatment. The different stages are: Acute treatment , to try to stop a stroke while it is happening Post-stroke rehabilitation , to overcome the disabilities caused by the stroke Prevention , to prevent a first stroke or, if you have already had one, prevent another stroke Acute treatments for ischemic stroke are usually medicines: You may get tPA, (tissue plasminogen activator), a medicine to dissolve the blood clot. You can only get this medicine within 4 hours of when your symptoms started. The sooner you can get it, the better your chance of recovery. If you cannot get that medicine, you may get medicine that helps stop platelets from clumping together to form blood clots. Or you may get a blood thinner to keep existing clots from getting bigger. If you have carotid artery disease, you may also need a procedure to open your blocked carotid artery Acute treatments for hemorrhagic stroke focus on stopping the bleeding. The first step is to find the cause of bleeding in the brain. The next step is to control it: If high blood pressure is the cause of bleeding, you may be given blood pressure medicines . If an aneurysm if the cause, you may need aneurysm clipping or coil embolization. These are surgeries to prevent further leaking of blood from the aneurysm. It also can help prevent the aneurysm from bursting again. If an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is the cause of a stroke, you may need an AVM repair. An AVM is a tangle of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain. An AVM repair may be done through Surgery Injecting a substance into the blood vessels of the AVM to block blood flow Radiation to shrink the blood vessels of the AVM Stroke rehabilitation can help you relearn skills you lost because of the damage. The goal is to help you become as independent as possible and to have the best possible quality of life. Prevention of another stroke is also important, since having a stroke increases the risk of getting another one. Prevention may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. Can strokes be prevented? If you have already had a stroke or are at risk of having a stroke, you can make some heart-healthy lifestyle changes to try to prevent a future stroke: Eating a heart-healthy diet Aiming for a healthy weight Managing stress Getting regular physical activity Quitting smoking Managing your blood pressure and cholesterol levels If these changes aren't enough, you may need medicine to control your risk factors.

Stroke Rehabilitation,https://medlineplus.gov/strokerehabilitation.html,A stroke can cause lasting brain damage. People who survive a stroke need to relearn skills they lost because of the damage. Rehabilitation can help them relearn those skills. The effects of a stroke depend on which area of the brain was damaged. The types of disabilities a stroke can cause include: Paralysis or problems controlling movement Pain and other problems with the senses Problems using or understanding language Problems with thinking and memory Emotional disturbances Stroke rehabilitation involves many kinds of health professionals.

Stuttering,https://medlineplus.gov/stuttering.html,"What is stuttering? Stuttering is a speech disorder . It involves interruptions in the flow of speech. These interruptions are called disfluencies. They may involve: Repeating sounds, syllables, or words Stretching out a sound Suddenly stopping in the middle of a syllable or word Sometimes, along with the stuttering, there may be nodding, rapid blinking, or trembling lips. The stuttering may be worse when you are stressed, excited, or tired. Stuttering can be frustrating, because you know exactly what you want to say, but you have trouble saying it. It can make it difficult to communicate with people. This can cause problems with school, work, and relationships. What causes stuttering? There are two main types of stuttering, and they have different causes: Developmental stuttering is the more common type. It starts in young children while they are still learning speech and language skills. Many children stutter when they first start talking. Most of them will outgrow it. But some continue to stutter, and the exact cause is unknown. There are differences in the brains of people who continue to stutter. Genetics may also play a role, since this type of stuttering can run in families. Neurogenic stuttering can happen after someone has a stroke , head trauma , or other type of brain injury . Because of the injury, the brain has trouble coordinating the different parts of the brain involved in speech. Who is at risk for stuttering? Stuttering can affect anyone, but it is much more common in boys than girls. Younger children are most likely to stutter. About 75% of children who stutter will get better. For the rest, stuttering can continue their whole lives. How is stuttering diagnosed? Stuttering is usually diagnosed by a speech-language pathologist. This is a health professional who is trained to test and treat people with voice, speech, and language disorders. If you or your child stutters, your regular health care provider may give you a referral to a speech-language pathologist. Or in some cases, a child's teacher may make a referral. To make a diagnosis, the speech-language pathologist will: Look at the case history, such as when the stuttering was first noticed, how often it happens, and in what situations it happens Listen to you or your child speak and analyze the stuttering Evaluate you or your child's speech and language abilities, including the ability to understand and use language Ask about the impact of stuttering on you or your child's life Ask whether stuttering runs in the family For a child, consider how likely it is that he or she will outgrow it What are the treatments for stuttering? There are different treatments that can help with stuttering. Some of these may help one person but not another. You need to work with the speech-language pathologist to figure out the best plan for you or your child. The plan should take into account how long the stuttering has been going on and whether there are any other speech or language problems. For a child, the plan should also take into account your child's age and whether he or she is likely to outgrow the stuttering. Younger children may not need therapy right away. Their parents and teachers can learn strategies to help the child practice speaking. That can help some children. As a parent, it's important to be calm and relaxed when your child is speaking. If your child feels pressured, it can make it harder for them to talk. The speech-language pathologist will probably want to evaluate your child regularly, to see whether treatment is needed. Speech therapy can help children and adults minimize stuttering. Some techniques include: Speaking more slowly Controlling breathing Gradually working up from single-syllable responses to longer words and more complex sentences For adults, self-help groups can help you find resources and support as you face the challenges of stuttering. There are electronic devices to help with fluency, but more research is needed to see whether they really help over the long term. Some people have tried medicines that usually treat other health problems such as epilepsy, anxiety, or depression. But these medicines are not approved for stuttering, and they often have side effects. NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders",MedlinePlus
Sudden Cardiac Arrest,https://medlineplus.gov/suddencardiacarrest.html,"What is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a condition in which the heart suddenly stops beating. When that happens, blood stops flowing to the brain and other vital organs. If it is not treated, SCA usually causes death within minutes. But quick treatment with a defibrillator may be lifesaving. How is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) different from a heart attack? A heart attack is different from an SCA. A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart is blocked. During a heart attack, the heart usually doesn't suddenly stop beating. With an SCA, the heart stops beating. Sometimes an SCA can happen after or during recovery from a heart attack. What causes sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? Your heart has an electrical system that controls the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat.  An SCA can happen when the heart's electrical system is not working right and causes irregular heartbeats. Irregular heartbeats are called arrhythmias . There are different types. They may cause the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. Some can cause the heart to stop pumping blood to the body; this is the type that causes SCA. Certain diseases and conditions can cause the electrical problems that lead to SCA. They include: Ventricular fibrillation , a type of arrhythmia where the ventricles (the heart's lower chambers) don't beat normally. Instead, they beat very fast and very irregularly. They can't pump blood to the body. This causes most SCAs. Coronary artery disease (CAD) , also called ischemic heart disease. CAD happens when the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. It is often caused by the buildup of plaque , a waxy substance, inside the lining of larger coronary arteries. The plaque blocks some or all of the blood flow to the heart. Some types of physical stress can cause your heart's electrical system to fail, such as Intense physical activity in which your body releases the hormone adrenaline. This hormone can trigger SCA in people who have heart problems. Very low blood levels of potassium or magnesium. These minerals play an important role in your heart's electrical system. Major blood loss Severe lack of oxygen Certain inherited disorders which can cause arrhythmias or problems with the structure of your heart Structural changes in the heart , such as an enlarged heart due to high blood pressure or advanced heart disease. Heart infections can also cause changes to the structure of the heart. Who is at risk for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? You are at higher risk for SCA if you: Have coronary artery disease (CAD). Most people with SCA have CAD. But CAD usually doesn't cause symptoms, so they may not know that they have it. Are older; your risk increases with age Are a man; it is more common in men than women Are Black or African American, especially if you have other conditions such as diabetes , high blood pressure, heart failure , or chronic kidney disease Have a personal history of heartbeats that aren't regular (arrhythmia) Have a personal or family history of SCA or inherited disorders that can cause arrhythmia Have a problem with drug or alcohol use Have had a heart attack Have heart failure What are the symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? Usually, the first sign of SCA is loss of consciousness ( fainting ). This happens when the heart stops beating. Some people may have a racing heartbeat or feel dizzy or light-headed just before they faint. And sometimes people have chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea, or vomiting in the hour before they have an SCA. How is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) diagnosed? SCA happens without warning and requires emergency treatment. Health care providers rarely diagnose SCA with medical tests as it's happening. Instead, it is usually diagnosed after it happens. Providers do this by ruling out other causes of a person's sudden collapse. If you are at high risk for SCA, your provider may refer you to a cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in heart diseases. The cardiologist may ask you to get various heart health tests to see how well you heart is working. He or she will work with you to decide whether you need treatment to prevent SCA. What are the treatments for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? SCA is an emergency. A person having SCA needs to be treated with a defibrillator right away. A defibrillator is a device sends an electric shock to the heart. The electric shock can restore a normal rhythm to a heart that's stopped beating. To work well, it needs to be done within minutes of the SCA. Most police officers, emergency medical technicians, and other first responders are trained and equipped to use a defibrillator. Call 9-1-1 right away if someone has signs or symptoms of SCA. The sooner you call for help, the sooner lifesaving treatment can begin. What should I do if I think that someone has had an SCA? Many public places such as schools, businesses, and airports have automated external defibrillators (AEDs). AEDs are special defibrillators that untrained people can use if they think that someone has had SCA. AEDS are programmed to give an electric shock if they detect a dangerous arrhythmia. This prevents giving a shock to someone who may have fainted but isn't having SCA. If you see someone who you think has had SCA, you should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until defibrillation can be done. People who are at risk for SCA may want to consider having an AED at home. Ask your cardiologist to help you decide whether having an AED in your home might help you. What are the treatments after surviving sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? If you survive SCA, you'll likely be admitted to a hospital for ongoing care and treatment. In the hospital, your medical team will closely watch your heart. They may give you medicines to try to reduce the risk of another SCA. They will also try to find out what caused your SCA. If you're diagnosed with coronary artery disease, you may have an angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery . These procedures help restore blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. Often, people who have had SCA get a device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) . This small device is surgically placed under the skin in your chest or abdomen. An ICD uses electric pulses or shocks to help control dangerous arrhythmias. Can sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) be prevented? You may be able to lower your risk of SCA by following a heart-healthy lifestyle . If you have coronary artery disease or another heart disease, treating that disease can also lower your risk of SCA. If you have had an SCA, getting an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) can lower your chance of having another SCA. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",MedlinePlus
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome,https://medlineplus.gov/suddeninfantdeathsyndrome.html,"Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden, unexplained death of an infant younger than one year old.

Tanning,https://medlineplus.gov/tanning.html,"Can a tan be healthy? Some people think that tanning gives them a healthy glow. But tanning, either outdoors or indoors with a tanning bed, is not healthy at all. It exposes you to harmful rays and puts you at risk for health problems such as melanoma and other skin cancers . What are UV rays, and how do they affect the skin? Sunlight travels to earth as a mixture of both visible and invisible rays. Some of the rays are harmless to people. But one kind, ultraviolet (UV) rays, can cause problems. They are a form of radiation. UV rays do help your body make vitamin D , but too much exposure damages your skin. Most people can get the vitamin D that they need with only about 5 to 15 minutes of sun exposure two to three times a week. There are three types of UV rays. Two of them, UVA and UVB, can reach the earth's surface and affect your skin. Using a tanning bed also exposes you to UVA and UVB. UVB rays can cause sunburn. UVA rays can travel more deeply into the skin than UVB rays. When your skin is exposed to UVA, it tries to protect itself from further damage. It does this by making more melanin, which is the skin pigment that makes your skin darker. That's what gives you a tan. This means that your tan is a sign of skin damage. What are the health risks of tanning? Since tanning means overexposure to UV rays, it can damage your skin and cause health problems such as: Premature skin aging , which can cause your skin to become thickened, leathery, and wrinkled. You may also have dark spots on your skin. These happen because long-term exposure to UV rays makes your skin less elastic. The more sun exposure you have, the earlier your skin ages . Skin cancers , including melanoma. This can happen because the UV light damages the DNA of your skin cells and interferes with your body's ability to fight the cancer. Actinic keratosis , a thick, scaly patch of skin that usually forms on areas exposed to the sun, such as the face, scalp, back of the hands, or chest. It can eventually become cancerous. Eye damage , including cataracts and photokeratitis (snow blindness) A weakened immune system , which can increase your sensitivity to sunlight, decrease the effects of vaccines , and cause you to have reactions to certain medicines. What should I do to protect my skin from UV rays? Limit sun exposure . Try to stay out of the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when its rays are strongest. But remember that you still get sun exposure when you are outside on cloudy days or are in the shade. Use sunscreen with sun protective factor (SPF) 15 or higher. It should also be a broad-spectrum sunscreen, which means that it gives you both UVA and UVB protection. If you have very light skin, use SPF 30 or higher. Apply sunscreen 20-30 minutes before going outside and reapply it at least every 2 hours. Wear sunglasses that block both UVA and UVB rays. Wrap-around sunglasses work best because they block UV rays from sneaking in from the side. Wear a hat . You can get the best protection with a wide-brimmed hat that is made out of a tightly woven fabric, such as canvas. Wear protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts and long pants and skirts. Clothes made from tightly woven fabric offer the best protection. It is also important to check your skin once a month. If you do see any new or changing spots or moles, go see your health care provider. Isn't indoor tanning safer than tanning in the sun? Indoor tanning is not better than tanning in the sun; it also exposes you to UV rays and damages your skin. Tanning beds use UVA light, so they expose you to a higher concentration of UVA rays than you would get by tanning in the sun. Tanning lights also expose you to some UVB rays. Some people think that getting a ""base tan"" in a tanning salon can protect you when you go in the sun. But a ""base tan"" causes damage to your skin and will not prevent you from getting sunburn when you go outside. Indoor tanning is particularly dangerous for younger people. You have a higher risk of melanoma if you started doing indoor tanning while you were a teen or young adult. Some research shows that frequent tanning may even be addictive. This can be dangerous because the more often you tan, the more damage you do to your skin. Are there safer ways to look tan? There are other ways to look tan, but they are not all safe: Tanning pills have a color additive that turns your skin orange after you take them. But they can be dangerous and are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Sunless tanners have no known risk for skin cancer, but you do have to be careful. Most spray tans, lotions, and gels use DHA, a color additive that makes your skin look tan. DHA is considered safe for use on the outside of your body by the FDA. You need to make sure it doesn't get into your nose, eyes, or mouth. If you use a spray tan, be careful not to breathe in the spray. Also, remember that these ""tans"" do not protect you from UV rays when you go outside.",MedlinePlus

Teen Sexual Health,https://medlineplus.gov/teensexualhealth.html,"What is teen sexual health? Teen sexual health is about how sex affects your physical and emotional health. It means knowing how to form healthy relationships and making decisions about sex that are right for you. As your body changes during puberty , how you think, feel, and interact with others also changes. You may have new feelings and thoughts about sex. Understanding who you're becoming as a sexual young adult is also part of teen sexual health. For all teens, taking responsibility for sexual health is part of growing up. Whether you choose to have sex or wait, responsibility includes knowing about: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Birth control What a healthy relationship is What are sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), are caused by bacteria , viruses , and parasites that spread from person to person, usually during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Some STIs are spread by skin-to-skin contact. Without treatment, some STIs can cause long-term health problems. There are more than 20 types of STIs, including: Chlamydia Genital herpes Gonorrhea HIV HPV (human papillomavirus) Pubic lice Syphilis Trichomoniasis STIs don't always cause symptoms. So it is possible to have an infection without knowing it and then pass it on to someone else. The only way to know for sure whether you have an STI is to get tested . How can I reduce my chances of getting a sexually transmitted infection (STI)? The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Saying ""no"" to sex is the right choice for many teens. If you decide to have sex, ""safer sex"" practices will lower your chance of getting an STI. They include: Talking with your partner about preventing STIs and getting tested before having sex. If you can't talk about STIs, you aren't ready to have sex. Getting the HPV vaccine. You can be vaccinated between ages 9 and 26. Using condoms correctly every time you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex: External (male) latex condoms provide the best protection against STIs. If you or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. Internal (female) condoms, made of nitrile, are placed inside the body (vagina or anus). They may be less effective against STIs than latex external condoms. Don't use both type of condoms together because that increases the chance they'll rip Use a dental dam (a square piece of latex, polyurethane, or nitrile) to protect the mouth during oral sex Having sex with only one person who has sex only with you (mutual monogamy). But first, both of you should get tested for STIs. Not mixing alcohol or drugs with sex. You need to think clearly to make safer choices about sex. How can I reduce the chance of pregnancy? The only sure way to avoid pregnancy is not to have vaginal sex. If you decide to have vaginal sex, birth control can help prevent pregnancy. There are many types of birth control that work in different ways.  Your health care provider can help you choose birth control that's best for you. Condoms are the only birth control method that protects against STIs. But condoms alone aren't the most effective form of birth control. It's safest to use condoms with another form of birth control to prevent both STIs and pregnancy. What is a healthy relationship? Healthy sex starts with a healthy relationship, so it's important to take an honest look at how you and your partner treat each other. Your relationship may be healthy if it includes: Respect. You and your partner value each other's feelings. Neither of you pressure the other to do things they don't want to do. Trust and honesty. You always tell the truth and trust your partner to do the same. Good communication. You feel safe talking openly about your feelings, STIs, and other relationships. And you both listen. Your relationship may be unhealthy if it includes: Jealousy and control. One of you wants to make all the decisions and tries to keep the other from spending time with their friends and family. Disrespect. One of you makes fun of the other person's ideas and feelings. Pressure. One of you tries to bully the other into doing sexual things they don't want to do. Violence . Hitting, shoving, grabbing, and sexual assault should never be part of a relationship. If you don't know how to end a violent relationship, get help. Your decisions about sex can affect your future health. Make sure that you know the facts so you can decide what is right for you.",MedlinePlus

Temporomandibular Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/temporomandibulardisorders.html,"What are temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)? Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a group of more than 30 conditions that affect your temporomandibular joints (TMJs). You have two TMJs; one on each side of your jaw. They connect your lower jaw to your skull. TMDs can cause problems in your jaw joint and your muscles that control jaw movement. These problems can include pain, stiffness, and trouble chewing. There are three main types of TMDs: Disorders of your jaw joints Disorders of the muscles you use for chewing Headaches from a TMD Many TMDs last only a short time and go away on their own. However, in some cases they can become chronic (long lasting) What causes temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)? Sometimes an injury to the jaw or TMJ can cause a TMD. But in most cases, the cause is not known. Research suggests that certain factors may play a role in why a TMD starts and whether it will be long lasting: Genetics Psychological and life stressors How someone perceives pain Who is more likely to develop a temporomandibular disorder (TMD)? Anyone can develop a TMD, but it is more common in women than in men. It is most common in women between 35 and 44 years old. What are the symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)? The symptoms of TMDs may include: Pain in the chewing muscles and/or jaw joint. This is the most common symptom. Pain that spreads to the face or neck. Jaw stiffness. Limited movement or locking of the jaw. Painful clicking or popping in your jaw joint when you open or close your mouth. However, clicking or popping without pain is common and is not a sign of a TMD. Tinnitus (ringing in the ears), hearing loss , or dizziness . A change in the way the upper and lower teeth fit together. How are temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) diagnosed? There is no standard test used to diagnose TMDs, and some other conditions can cause some similar symptoms. This can make TMDs hard to diagnose. To find out if you have a TMD, your health care provider or dentist: Will take a detailed medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. They will want to know: Where the pain is When you have it What makes it better or worse If it stays in one area or spreads to other parts of your body If you have any other pain conditions such as headache or back pain Will examine your head, neck, face, and jaw for: Tenderness Jaw clicking or popping Problems moving your jaw May order imaging studies such as an x-ray , MRI , or CT What are the treatments for temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)? For many people, the symptoms of TMD are temporary. To help you feel better, your provider or dentist may suggest that you: Eat soft foods. Apply heat or cold to the face and do some exercises to gently stretch and strengthen your jaw muscles. Take over-the-counter pain relievers , such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen. Stop clenching your jaw, chewing gum, and biting your nails. If those do not help, your provider or dentist may suggest other treatments such as: Physical therapy Self-management and behavioral health approaches , which can include: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) , a type of psychotherapy. It can help you identify negative thoughts and change them. It can also teach you coping skills. Biofeedback , which involves using electronic devices to teach you to control certain body functions, such as your heartbeat, blood pressure, and muscle tension. For example, it can detect when you tighten your jaw muscles. You can learn how to recognize when this happens and then relax your muscles. Medicines such as: Anti-anxiety medicines Antidepressants Anti-seizure medicines Prescription pain relievers An intraoral appliance , which is a device that fits over your teeth. Types of intraoral appliances include oral splints and mouth guards. If you are going to use one, it's important to: Know that there is not a lot of evidence that they improve TMD pain. Make sure that the appliance you have is not designed to permanently change your bite. Let your provider or dentist know if it makes your pain worse. Complementary treatments , which are treatments that are used along with mainstream medical care. There is limited evidence showing that they help with TMD symptoms. But some providers and dentists may recommend acupuncture and transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS). TENS involves using a device to send a gentle electric current to your nerves or muscles. It may help treat pain by interrupting or blocking the pain signals. If you are still having severe symptoms from a TMD, your provider or dentist may suggest surgery, including implant surgery, or another procedure. It's important to be careful, because sometimes surgery or another procedure may not work or may even make your symptoms worse. Before any surgery or other procedure, it is very important to get opinions from more than one provider and to completely understand the risks. If possible, get an opinion from a surgeon who specializes in treating TMDs. NIH: National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research",MedlinePlus

Tonsillitis,https://medlineplus.gov/tonsillitis.html,"What are tonsils? Tonsils are lumps of tissue at the back of the throat. There are two of them, one on each side. Along with the adenoids , tonsils are part of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance.  Tonsils and adenoids work by trapping the germs coming in through the mouth and nose. What is tonsillitis? Tonsillitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the tonsils. Sometimes along with tonsillitis, the adenoids are also swollen. What causes tonsillitis? The cause of tonsillitis is usually a viral infection. Bacterial infections such as strep throat can also cause tonsillitis. Who is at risk for tonsillitis? Tonsillitis is most common in children over age two. Almost every child in the United States gets it at least once. Tonsillitis caused by bacteria is more common in kids ages 5-15. Tonsillitis caused by a virus is more common in younger children. Adults can get tonsillitis, but it is not very common. Is tonsillitis contagious? Although tonsillitis is not contagious, the viruses and bacteria that cause it are contagious. Frequent handwashing can help prevent spreading or catching the infections. What are the symptoms of tonsillitis? The symptoms of tonsillitis include: A sore throat , which may be severe Red, swollen tonsils Trouble swallowing A white or yellow coating on the tonsils Swollen glands in the neck Fever Bad breath When does my child need to see a health care provider for tonsillitis? You should call your health care provider if your child: Has a sore throat for more than two days Has trouble or pain when swallowing Feels very sick or very weak You should get emergency care right away if your child: Has trouble breathing Starts drooling Has a lot of trouble swallowing How is tonsillitis diagnosed? To diagnose tonsillitis, your child's health care provider will first ask you about your child's symptoms and medical history. The provider will look at your child's throat and neck, checking for things such as redness or white spots on the tonsils and swollen lymph nodes. Your child will probably also have one or more tests to check for strep throat, since it can cause tonsillitis and it requires treatment. It could be a rapid strep test, a throat culture, or both. For both tests, the provider uses a cotton swab to collect a sample of fluids from your child's tonsils and the back of the throat. With the rapid strep test, testing is done in the office, and you get the results within minutes. The throat culture is done in a lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results. The throat culture is a more reliable test. So sometimes if the rapid strep test is negative (meaning that it does not show any strep bacteria), the provider will also do a throat culture just to make sure that your child does not have strep. What are the treatments for tonsillitis? Treatment for tonsillitis depends on the cause. If the cause is a virus, there is no medicine to treat it. If the cause is a bacterial infection, such as strep throat, your child will need to take antibiotics . It is important for your child to finish the antibiotics even if he or she feels better. If treatment stops too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect your child. No matter what is causing the tonsillitis, there are some things you can do to help your child feel better. Make sure that your child: Gets a lot of rest Drinks plenty of fluids Tries eating soft foods if it hurts to swallow Tries eating warm liquids or cold foods like popsicles to soothe the throat Isn't around cigarette smoke or anything else that could irritate the throat Sleeps in a room with a humidifier Gargles with saltwater Sucks on a lozenge (but do not give them to children under four; they can choke on them) Takes an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen. Children and teenagers should not take aspirin. In some cases, your child may need a tonsillectomy. What is a tonsillectomy and why might my child need one? A tonsillectomy is surgery to remove the tonsils. Your child might need it if he or she: Keeps getting tonsillitis Has bacterial tonsillitis that does not get better with antibiotics Has tonsils that are too big and are causing trouble breathing or swallowing Your child usually gets the surgery and goes home later that day. Very young children and people who have complications may need to stay in the hospital overnight. It can take a week or two before your child completely recovers from the surgery.",MedlinePlus
Tooth Decay,https://medlineplus.gov/toothdecay.html,"What is tooth decay? Tooth decay is damage to a tooth's surface, or enamel. It happens when bacteria in your mouth make acids that attack the enamel. Tooth decay can lead to cavities (dental caries), which are holes in your teeth. If tooth decay is not treated, it can cause pain, infection, and even tooth loss. What causes tooth decay? Our mouths are full of bacteria. Some bacteria are helpful. But some can be harmful, including the ones that play a role in tooth decay. These bacteria combine with food to form a soft, sticky film called plaque. The bacteria in plaque use the sugar and starch in what you eat and drink to make acids. The acids begin to eat away at the minerals on your enamel. Over time, the plaque can harden into tartar. Besides damaging your teeth, plaque and tartar can also irritate your gums and cause gum disease . You get fluoride from toothpaste, water, and other sources. This fluoride, along with your salvia, helps the enamel repair itself by replacing the minerals. Your teeth go through this natural process of losing minerals and regaining minerals all day long. But if you don't take care of your teeth and/or you eat and drink lots of sugary or starchy things, your enamel will keep losing minerals. This leads to tooth decay. A white spot may appear where minerals have been lost. This is an early sign of tooth decay. You may be able to stop or reverse the decay at this point. Your enamel can still repair itself, if you take better care of your teeth and limit sugary/starchy foods and drinks. But if the tooth decay process continues, more minerals are lost. Over time, the enamel is weakened and destroyed, forming a cavity. A cavity is a hole in your tooth. It is permanent damage that a dentist has to repair with a filling. Who is at risk for tooth decay? The main risk factors for tooth decay are not taking care of your teeth and having too many sugary or starchy foods and drinks. Some people have a higher risk of tooth decay, including people who: Don't have enough saliva, because of medicines, certain diseases, or some cancer treatments Don't get enough fluoride Are very young. Babies and toddlers who drink from bottles are at risk, especially if they are given juice or get bottles at bedtime. This exposes their teeth to sugars for long periods of time. Are older. Many older adults have receding gums and more wear on their teeth. These raise the risk of decay on the exposed root surfaces of their teeth. What are the symptoms of tooth decay and cavities? In early tooth decay, you usually don't have symptoms. As tooth decay gets worse, it can cause: A toothache (tooth pain) Tooth sensitivity to sweets, hot, or cold White or brown stains on the surface of a tooth A cavity An infection, which can lead to an abscess (pocket of pus) forming. The abscess can cause pain, facial swelling, and fever. How are tooth decay and cavities diagnosed? Dentists usually find tooth decay and cavities by looking at your teeth and probing them with dental instruments. Your dentist will also ask if you have any symptoms. Sometimes you may need a dental x-ray. What are the treatments for tooth decay and cavities? There are several treatments for tooth decay and cavities. Which treatment you get depends on how bad the problem is: Fluoride treatments. If you have early tooth decay, a fluoride treatment can help the enamel to repair itself. Fillings. If you have a typical cavity, your dentist will remove the decayed tooth tissue and then restore the tooth by filling it with a filling material. Root canal. If the damage to the tooth and/or an infection spreads to the pulp (inside of the tooth), you might need a root canal. Your dentist will remove the decayed pulp and clean inside the tooth and root. The next step is to fill the tooth with a temporary filling. Then you will need to come back to get a permanent filling or a crown (a cover on the tooth). Extraction (pulling the tooth). In the most severe cases, when the damage to the pulp cannot be fixed, your dentist may pull the tooth. Your dentist will suggest that you get a bridge or implant to replace the missing tooth. Otherwise, the teeth next to the gap may move over and change your bite. Can tooth decay be prevented? There are steps that you can take to prevent tooth decay: Make sure that you get enough fluoride by Brushing with a fluoride toothpaste Drinking tap water with fluoride. Most bottled water does not contain fluoride. Using fluoride mouth rinse Practice good oral health by brushing your teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste and regularly flossing your teeth Make smart food choices by limiting foods and drinks that are high in sugars and starches. Eat nutritious, balanced meals and limit snacking. Do not use tobacco products, including smokeless tobacco . If you currently use tobacco, consider quitting . See a dentist for regular check-ups and professional cleanings Make sure that your children get sealants on their teeth. Dental sealants are thin plastic coatings that protect the chewing surfaces of the back teeth. Children should get sealants on their back teeth as soon as they come in, before decay can attack the teeth. NIH: National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research",MedlinePlus
Tooth Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/toothdisorders.html,"What are teeth? Your teeth are made of a hard, bonelike material.

A tsunami can move hundreds of miles per hour in the open ocean. It can smash into land with waves as high as 100 feet or more and cause devastating floods . Drowning is the most common cause of death related to a tsunami. Although there are no guarantees of safety during a tsunami, you can take actions to protect yourself.  You should have a disaster plan . Being prepared can help reduce fear, anxiety, and losses. If you do experience a disaster, it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope .

Tubal Ligation,https://medlineplus.gov/tuballigation.html,"Tubal ligation (getting your ""tubes tied"") is a type of surgery. It prevents a woman from getting pregnant. It is a permanent form of birth control , and is effective right away. The surgery cuts, ties, or seals the fallopian tubes. This blocks the path between the ovaries and the uterus. The sperm cannot reach the egg to fertilize it, and the egg cannot reach the uterus. You get the surgery in a hospital or outpatient surgical center. It usually takes about 30 minutes. Almost all women go home the same day. They can return to most normal activities within a few days. Tubal ligation can sometimes be reversed. The reversal is major surgery, and does not always work.",MedlinePlus
Tuberculosis,https://medlineplus.gov/tuberculosis.html,"What is tuberculosis (TB)? Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial disease that usually attacks the lungs. But it can also attack other parts of the body, including the kidneys, spine, and brain. Not everyone infected with TB bacteria (germs) becomes sick. So, there are two types of TB conditions: Inactive (latent) TB infection , where the TB germs live in your body but don't make you sick. TB disease (active TB) where you get sick from the TB germs. TB disease can almost always be cured with antibiotics . But if it's not treated properly, it can be fatal. TB is found in the U.S., but it is more common in certain other countries. What causes tuberculosis (TB)? TB is caused by bacteria (germs) called Mycobacterium tuberculosis . The germs spread from person to person through the air. People who have TB disease in their throat or lungs spread the germs in the air when they cough, sneeze, talk, or sing. If you breathe in the air that has the germs, you can get TB. TB is not spread by touching, kissing, or sharing food or dishes. You're more likely to catch TB from people you live or work with than from people you see for shorter amounts of time. Who is more likely to get infected with tuberculosis (TB) germs? Anyone who is near a person with TB disease can get infected with the germs. You are more likely to be near someone with TB disease if you: Were born in or often travel to countries where TB disease is common Are a health care worker Work or live in a place where TB is more common, such as shelters for people without homes, jails, and nursing homes Who is more likely to develop TB disease? Certain people are more likely to get sick with TB disease after they get infected. They include people who: Have HIV Became infected with TB in the last 2 years Have other diseases, such as diabetes , that make it hard for your body to fight TB germs Have alcohol use disorder (AUD) or inject illegal drugs Were not treated correctly for TB in the past Are under age 5 Are an older adult Take medicines that weaken the immune system , such as medicines taken after an organ transplant , steroids , and specialized treatments for certain autoimmune diseases What are the symptoms of tuberculosis (TB)? Most people who have TB germs in their bodies don't get sick with TB disease. Instead, they have inactive TB infection. With an inactive TB infection, you: Don't have symptoms Can't spread TB to others Could get sick with active TB disease in the future if your immune system becomes weak for another reason Need to take medicine to prevent getting sick with active TB disease in the future If you have TB disease , the TB germs are active, meaning that they are growing (multiplying) inside your body and making you sick. If the TB is growing in your lungs or throat, you can spread the TB germs to other people. You can get sick with TB disease weeks to years after you're infected with TB germs. With TB disease, your symptoms will depend on where the TB is growing in your body: General symptoms may include: Chills and fever Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep) Losing weight without trying Loss of appetite Weakness or fatigue Symptoms from TB disease in your lungs may include: A cough that lasts longer than 3 weeks Coughing up blood or sputum (a thick mucus from the lungs) Chest pain How is tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed? Your health care provider or your local health department can test you to find out if you have TB germs in your body. They will give you either a TB skin or blood test . If your test shows that you have TB germs, you'll need to have other tests to see if the germs are actively growing: Tests for TB disease in the lungs usually include testing samples of your sputum and having chest x-rays . Tests for TB disease in other parts of your body may include tests of urine and tissue samples . You may need a TB test if you have symptoms of TB disease or if you are at high risk because you are more likely to be near someone with TB disease. People who have HIV also need to get tested for TB. HIV weakens your immune system. So if you have both HIV and inactive TB, the TB can quickly become active TB disease. You will need treatment for the inactive TB as soon as possible to prevent active TB disease. What is the treatment for tuberculosis (TB)? The treatment for both inactive TB infection and TB disease is antibiotics. To make sure you get rid of all the TB germs in your body, it's very important to follow the directions for taking your medicine. If you don't follow the directions, the TB germs in your body could change and become antibiotic resistant . That means the medicine may stop working and your TB may become hard to cure. For inactive TB infections , you need to take medicines for three, four, six, or nine months, depending on the treatment plan. Treatment helps make sure you don't get TB disease in the future. For active TB disease , you usually need to take medicines for four, six, or nine months, depending on the treatment plan. Treatment will almost always cure you if you take your pills the right way. For TB disease in your lungs or throat , you'll need to stay home for a few weeks, so you don't spread disease to other people. You can protect the people you live with by: Covering your nose and mouth. Opening windows when possible. Not getting too close to them. For drug-resistant TB disease, which means that the TB germs are resistant to certain TB medicines, you will need to take special medicines. Treatment may take a long time, sometimes months or years. The medicines can cause side effects . Your provider will closely monitor your treatment to make sure the medicines are working. By following medical advice for TB testing and treatment, you can keep yourself healthy and help stop the spread of TB. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",MedlinePlus

Chromosomes are tiny ""packages"" in your cells that contain your genes. Genes carry information, called DNA, that controls what you look like and how your body works.  Normally, girls receive one X chromosome from each parent. Turner syndrome happens when one of the X chromosomes is partially or completely missing. What are the symptoms of Turner syndrome? Turner syndrome can cause many different symptoms. The symptoms may be mild for some people. But for others, Turner syndrome can cause serious health problems. Some of the symptoms of Turner syndrome affect a person's appearance. Most people with Turner syndrome are shorter than average. They may also have physical features such as: A neck that is short and has extra skin (a ""webbed"" neck) A low hairline in the back Low-set ears Swollen hands and feet People with Turner syndrome may be born with heart and kidney defects. They usually don't have typical sexual development and are infertile. They are also at risk for other health problems such as high blood pressure , type 2 diabetes , osteoporosis , and thyroid problems . How is Turner syndrome diagnosed? Health care providers diagnose Turner syndrome based on symptoms and a genetic blood test called a karyotype test . Sometimes it is found in prenatal testing . What are the treatments for Turner syndrome? There is no cure for Turner syndrome, but there are treatments for some of the symptoms: If they are started in early childhood, hormone injections can often increase adult height by a few inches Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) can help start sexual development. It also protects against bone loss Assisted reproduction technologies can help some women with Turner syndrome get pregnant People who have Turner syndrome need regular health checks.

Understanding Medical Research,https://medlineplus.gov/understandingmedicalresearch.html,"Almost every day, new findings from medical research are published in scientific journals. These journal articles often become sources for news stories. They can be important tools in helping you manage your health. But it's not always easy to understand them and know what they mean for your life. For example: What you hear about a study may not explain how it fits into the bigger picture. Sometimes the results of one study seem to disagree with the results of another study. That could be because the studies could have different designs and asked different questions. The news stories don't always explain this. Sometimes the studies are very small, and researchers need to do more studies to confirm the results. But the news stories about these small studies may not highlight this. So it's important to think carefully when reading or listening to reports of new medical findings. Here are some questions that can help you evaluate that information : Was the study in animals or humans? Getting certain results in animals may not mean that you get those same results in humans. Were the people in the study similar to you in ways that may matter, such as age, race, or sex? How big was the study? Larger studies may get more reliable results than smaller studies. How long did the study last? For example, studies testing medicines need to be long enough to show long-term benefits or risks. What kind of study was it? Clinical trials , especially randomized controlled trials, give the clearest information about whether a treatment is effective and safe in humans. In randomized controlled trials, the people in the study are randomly divided into separate groups that get different treatments. This helps prevent bias in the results. Where was the research done? If a new treatment was being tested, what were the side effects? How common were they? How do the results from the study compare with previous studies? If the new study had different results, then more studies would be needed to confirm these results. Who paid for the research? Sometimes the people paying for the research could profit financially if the study gets certain results. Who is reporting the results? Do they have a certain bias? It can be helpful to stay informed about new medical findings. But it's good to have some skepticism. Keep these questions in mind the next time you hear about a big new medical breakthrough.",MedlinePlus
Ureteral Disorders,https://medlineplus.gov/ureteraldisorders.html,"Your kidneys make urine by filtering wastes and extra water from your blood.  The urine travels from the kidneys to the bladder in two thin tubes called ureters. The ureters are about 8 to 10 inches long. Muscles in the ureter walls tighten and relax to force urine down and away from the kidneys. Small amounts of urine flow from the ureters into the bladder about every 10 to 15 seconds. Sometimes the ureters can become blocked or injured. This can block the flow of urine to the bladder. If urine stands still or backs up the ureter, you may get a urinary tract infection . Doctors diagnose problems with the ureters using different tests. These include urine tests, x-rays, and examination of the ureter with a scope called a cystoscope.

Urinary Incontinence,https://medlineplus.gov/urinaryincontinence.html,"What is urinary incontinence (UI)? Urinary incontinence (UI) is the loss of bladder control, or being unable to control urination. It is a common condition. It can range from being a minor problem to something that greatly affects your daily life.  In any case, it can get better with proper treatment. What are the types of urinary incontinence (UI)? There are several different types of UI. Each type has different symptoms and causes: Stress incontinence happens when stress or pressure on your bladder causes you to leak urine.  This could be due to coughing, sneezing, laughing, lifting something heavy, or physical activity. Causes include weak pelvic floor muscles and the bladder being out of its normal position. Urge, or urgency, incontinence happens when you have a strong urge (need) to urinate, and some urine leaks out before you can make it to the toilet. It is often related to an overactive bladder . Urge incontinence is most common in older people. It can sometimes be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI) . It can also happen in some neurological conditions , such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries . Overflow incontinence happens when your bladder doesn't empty all the way. This causes too much urine to stay in your bladder. Your bladder gets too full, and you leak urine. This form of UI is most common in men. Some of the causes include tumors, kidney stones , diabetes , and certain medicines. Functional incontinence happens when a physical or mental disability , trouble speaking , or some other problem keeps you from getting to the toilet in time. For example, someone with arthritis may have trouble unbuttoning his or her pants, or a person with Alzheimer's disease may not realize they need to plan to use the toilet. Mixed incontinence means that you have more than one type of incontinence. It's usually a combination of stress and urge incontinence. Transient incontinence is urine leakage that is caused by a temporary (transient) situation such as an infection or new medicine. Once the cause is removed, the incontinence goes away. Bedwetting refers to urine leakage during sleep. This is most common in children, but adults can also have it. Bedwetting is normal for many children. It is more common in boys. Bedwetting is often not considered a health problem, especially when it runs in the family. But if it still happens often at age 5 and older, it may be because of a bladder control problem. This problem could be caused by slow physical development, an illness, making too much urine at night, or another problem. Sometimes there is more than one cause. In adults, the causes include some medicines, caffeine , and alcohol . It can also be caused by certain health problems, such as diabetes insipidus , a urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney stones, enlarged prostate (BPH), and sleep apnea . Who is at risk for urinary incontinence (UI)? In adults, you are at higher risk of developing UI if you: Are female, especially after going through pregnancy, childbirth, and/or menopause Are older. As you age, your urinary tract muscles weaken, making it harder to hold in urine. Are a man with prostate problems Have certain health problems, such as diabetes, obesity , or long-lasting constipation Are a smoker Have a birth defect that affects the structure of your urinary tract In children, bedwetting is more common in younger children, boys, and those whose parents wet the bed when they were children. How is urinary incontinence (UI) diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. Your provider may ask you to keep a bladder diary for a few days before your appointment. The bladder diary includes how much and when you drink liquids, when and how much you urinate, and whether you leak urine. A physical exam, which can include a rectal exam. Women may also get a pelvic exam. Urine and/or blood tests Bladder function tests Imaging tests What are the treatments for urinary incontinence (UI)? Treatment depends on the type and cause of your UI. You may need a combination of treatments. Your provider may first suggest self-care treatments, including: Lifestyle changes to reduce leaks: Drinking the right amount of liquid at the right time Being physically active Staying at a healthy weigh Avoiding constipation Not smoking Bladder training. This involves urinating according to a schedule. Your provider makes a schedule from you, based on information from your bladder diary. After you adjust to the schedule, you gradually wait a little longer between trips to the bathroom. This can help stretch your bladder so it can hold more urine. Doing exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles . Strong pelvic floor muscles hold in urine better than weak muscles. The strengthening exercises are called Kegel exercises. They involve tightening and relaxing the muscles that control urine flow. If these treatments do not work, your provider may suggest other options such as: Medicines , which can be used to Relax the bladder muscles, to help prevent bladder spasms Block nerve signals that cause urinary frequency and urgency In men, shrink the prostate and improve urine flow Medical devices , including A catheter, which is a tube to carry urine out of the body. You might use one a few times a day or all the time. For women, a ring or a tampon-like device inserted into the vagina. The devices pushes up against your urethra to help decrease leaks. Bulking agents , which are injected into the bladder neck and urethra tissues to thicken them. This helps close your bladder opening so you have less leaking. Electrical nerve stimulation , which involves changing your bladder's reflexes using pulses of electricity Surgery to support the bladder in its normal position. This may be done with a sling that is attached to the pubic bone. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",MedlinePlus

However, some uterine fibroids could cause infertility (not being able to get pregnant), pregnancy loss , or problems with fetal development or delivery . Who is more likely to get uterine fibroids? If you're a female and the age when you're usually able to get pregnant and give birth, you could develop fibroids. Some factors may increase your risk of having uterine fibroids. These can include: Age. Women who are older have a higher risk. Race/ethnicity. Black/African American women often have fibroids at a younger age. They're also more likely to have larger fibroids with worse symptoms. Family history. If your mother or sister had uterine fibroids. Other factors. If you started your period before age 10 or have never been pregnant. Certain medical conditions. These include obesity or vitamin D deficiency . Your risk of getting uterine fibroids lowers with each pregnancy and with long-term use of birth control pills or shots. What causes uterine fibroids? No one knows what causes uterine fibroids. A few things that might play a part in getting uterine fibroids include genetics and growth hormones. Also, other hormones like estrogen and progesterone seem to help fibroids grow. These hormones cause the tissue lining inside the uterus to thicken during each menstrual cycle to prepare for pregnancy. What are the symptoms of uterine fibroids? Many women with fibroids have no symptoms. If you do, the type of symptoms may be due to location, size, and number of fibroids. Symptoms may include: Heavy or painful periods or bleeding between periods Feeling ""full"" in the lower abdomen (belly) Urinating (peeing) often Pain during sex Lower back pain Problems getting pregnant, multiple miscarriages, or early labor while pregnant How are uterine fibroids diagnosed? You may not know that you have uterine fibroids unless you have symptoms. Or your health care provider may find the fibroids during a pelvic exam , or with imaging tests . Uterine fibroids might be very small, or in extreme cases, they may grow large enough to make it appear like a pregnancy. What are the treatments for uterine fibroids? If you have no symptoms, you may not even need treatment. If you have symptoms, the treatment for uterine fibroids depends on many factors. These can include: Your symptoms. Your age. Sometimes fibroids shrink during and after menopause due to a drop in hormone levels. The location, type, and size of fibroids. If you are pregnant or want to get pregnant in the future.

Vaccine Safety,https://medlineplus.gov/vaccinesafety.html,"What are vaccines? Vaccines play an important role in keeping us healthy. They protect us from serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria . Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make you sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ. These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps your body fight off the germs. Your immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity. These diseases can be very serious. Because of this, getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would. Do vaccines cause side effects? As with medicines, any vaccine can cause side effects. Most of the time the side effects are minor, such as a sore arm, fatigue , or mild fever . They usually go away within a few days. These common side effects are often a sign that your body is starting to build immunity against a disease. Serious side effects from vaccines can happen, but they are very rare. These side effects could include a severe allergic reaction . Other possible side effects are different for each vaccine. Talk with your health care provider if you're concerned about your health after getting vaccinated. Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and ASD. How are vaccines tested for safety? Every vaccine that is approved in the United States goes through extensive safety testing. It starts with testing and evaluation of the vaccine before it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This process can often take several years.: First, the vaccine is tested in labs. Based on those tests, the FDA decides whether to test the vaccine with people. Testing with people is done through clinical trials . In these trials, the vaccines are tested on volunteers. Clinical trials usually start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers. The clinical trials have three phases. The trials are looking for the answer to important questions such as Is the vaccine safe? What dose (amount) works best? How does the immune system react to it? How effective is it? During the process, the FDA works closely with the company who makes the vaccine to evaluate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will be approved and licensed by the FDA. After a vaccine is licensed, experts may consider adding it to the recommended vaccine, or immunization, schedule. This schedule is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. They list which age groups should get which vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them. Testing and monitoring continue after the vaccine is approved: The company making the vaccines tests every batch of vaccines for quality and safety. The FDA reviews the results of these tests. It also inspects the factories where the vaccine is made. These checks help make sure the vaccines meet standards for quality and safety. The FDA, CDC, and other federal agencies continue to monitor its safety, to watch for possible side effects. They have systems to track any safety issues with the vaccines. These high safety standards and testing help to make sure that vaccines in the United States are safe. Vaccines help protect against serious, even deadly, diseases. They not only protect you, but also help to keep these diseases from spreading to others.",MedlinePlus
Vaccines,https://medlineplus.gov/vaccines.html,"What are vaccines? Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. For example, there are vaccines to protect against diseases caused by: Viruses , like the ones that cause the flu and COVID-19 Bacteria , including tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis What are the types of vaccines? There are several types of vaccines: Live-attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of the germ. Inactivated vaccines use a killed version of the germ. Subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines use only specific pieces of the germ, such as its protein, sugar, or casing. Toxoid vaccines use a toxin (harmful product) made by the germ. mRNA vaccines use messenger RNA, which gives your cells instructions for how to make a protein (or piece of a protein) of the germ. Viral vector vaccines use genetic material, which gives your cells instructions for making a protein of the germ. These vaccines also contain a different, harmless virus that helps get the genetic material into your cells. These vaccines may work in different ways, but they all spark an immune response. The immune response is the way your body defends itself against substances it sees as foreign or harmful. These substances include germs that can cause disease. What happens in an immune response? There are different steps in the immune response: When a germ invades, your body sees it as foreign. Your immune system helps your body fight off the germ. Your immune system also remembers the germ. It will attack the germ if it ever invades again. This ""memory"" protects you against the disease that the germ causes. This type of protection is called immunity. What are immunization and vaccination? Immunization is the process of becoming protected against a disease. But it can also mean the same thing as vaccination, which is getting a vaccine to become protected against a disease. Why are vaccines important? Vaccines are important because they protect you against many diseases. These diseases can be very serious. So getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. For a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would. But vaccines don't just protect you. They also protect the people around you through community immunity. What is community immunity? Community immunity, or herd immunity, is the idea that vaccines can help keep communities healthy. Normally, germs can travel quickly through a community and make a lot of people sick. If enough people get sick, it can lead to an outbreak. But when enough people are vaccinated against a certain disease, it's harder for that disease to spread to others. This type of protection means that the entire community is less likely to get the disease. Community immunity is especially important for people who can't get certain vaccines. For example, they may not be able to get a vaccine because they have weakened immune systems. Others may be allergic to certain vaccine ingredients. And newborn babies are too young to get some vaccines. Community immunity can help to protect them all. Are vaccines safe? Vaccines are safe . They must go through extensive safety testing and evaluation before they are approved in the United States. What is a vaccine schedule? A vaccine, or immunization, schedule lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. It includes who should get the vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes the vaccine schedule. It's important for both children and adults to get their vaccines according to the schedule. Following the schedule allows them to get protection from the diseases at exactly the right time.",MedlinePlus
Vaginal Bleeding,https://medlineplus.gov/vaginalbleeding.html,"Menstruation, or period, is a woman's monthly bleeding. Abnormal vaginal bleeding is different from normal menstrual periods. It could be bleeding that is between periods, is very heavy, or lasts much longer than usual. It also includes bleeding that happens before puberty or after menopause. Causes can include: Uterine fibroids or polyps Hormone problems Hormone pills, such as birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy (menopausal hormone therapy) Cancer of the cervix , ovaries , uterus or vagina Thyroid problems Bleeding during pregnancy can have several different causes. It is not always serious, but to be safe you should contact your health care provider right away.

Vaginal Cancer,https://medlineplus.gov/vaginalcancer.html,"What is vaginal cancer? Vaginal cancer is a rare type of cancer that starts in the vagina. The vagina is the canal leading from your cervix (the opening of your uterus) to the outside of your body. Who is more likely to develop vaginal cancer? You are more likely to develop vaginal cancer if: You're age 60 or older. You've had certain types of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infections. You were exposed to a medicine called DES (diethylstilbestrol) before you were born. Between 1940-1971, DES was sometimes prescribed to prevent miscarriages. DES was later linked to different health problems, including vaginal cancer. You have had abnormal cells in your vagina , cervix , or uterus . What are the symptoms of vaginal cancer? Vaginal cancer often doesn't have early symptoms. However, see your health care provider if you notice: Vaginal bleeding that is not your period A vaginal lump Pelvic pain Pain during sex Pain while urinating (peeing) Constipation or blood in your stool (poop) or urine (pee) How is vaginal cancer diagnosed? To find out if you have vaginal cancer, your provider will use tests that examine the vagina and other organs in your pelvis. These tests may include: A pelvic exam . Your provider may also do a Pap test and/or an HPV test during your pelvic exam. Colposcopy , a procedure to examine your cervix, vagina, and vulva. Biopsy , a procedure to remove some cells so they can be checked for cancer. What are the treatments for vaginal cancer? Vaginal cancer can often be cured if it is found early. Treatments for vaginal cancer may include surgery, radiation therapy , and/or chemotherapy . Can vaginal cancer be prevented? Vaccines that protect against HPV infection may reduce your risk of vaginal cancer. The vaccines provide the most protection if you get them before you are exposed to HPV. So it's best to get vaccinated before you become sexually active. NIH: National Cancer Institute",MedlinePlus

Other problems that affect the vagina include sexually transmitted infections (STIs), vaginal cancer , and vulvar cancer . Treatment of vaginal problems depends on the cause.",MedlinePlus
Vaginitis,https://medlineplus.gov/vaginitis.html,"What is vaginitis? Vaginitis, also called vulvovaginitis, is an inflammation or infection of the vagina. It can also affect the vulva, which is the external part of a woman's genitals. Vaginitis can cause itching, pain, discharge, and odor. Vaginitis is common, especially in women in their reproductive years.  It usually happens when there is a change in the balance of bacteria or yeast that are normally found in your vagina. There are different types of vaginitis, and they have different causes, symptoms, and treatments. What  causes vaginitis? Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women ages 15-44. It happens when there is an imbalance between the ""good"" and ""harmful"" bacteria that are normally found in a woman's vagina. Many things can change the balance of bacteria, including: Taking antibiotics Douching Using an intrauterine device (IUD) Having unprotected sex with a new partner Having many sexual partners Yeast infections (candidiasis) happen when too much candida grows in the vagina. Candida is the scientific name for yeast. It is a fungus that lives almost everywhere, including in your body. You may have too much growing in the vagina because of: Antibiotics Pregnancy Diabetes, especially if it is not well-controlled Corticosteroid medicines Trichomoniasis can also cause vaginitis. Trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI). It is caused by a parasite. You can also have vaginitis if you are allergic or sensitive to certain products that you use. Examples include vaginal sprays, douches, spermicides, soaps, detergents, or fabric softeners. They can cause burning, itching, and discharge. Hormonal changes can also cause vaginal irritation. Examples are when you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or when you have gone through menopause. Sometimes you can have more than one cause of vaginitis at the same time. What are the symptoms of vaginitis? The symptoms of vaginitis depend on which type you have. With BV, you may not have symptoms. You could have a thin white or gray vaginal discharge. There may be an odor, such as a strong fish-like odor, especially after sex. Yeast infections produce a thick, white discharge from the vagina that can look like cottage cheese. The discharge can be watery and often has no smell. Yeast infections usually cause the vagina and vulva to become itchy and red. You may not have symptoms when you have trichomoniasis. If you do have them, they include itching, burning, and soreness of the vagina and vulva. You may have burning during urination. You could also have gray-green discharge, which may smell bad. How is the cause of vaginitis diagnosed? To find out the cause of your symptoms, your health care provider may: Ask you about your medical history Do a pelvic exam Look for vaginal discharge, noting its color, qualities, and any odor Study a sample of your vaginal fluid under a microscope In some cases, you may need more tests. What are the treatments for vaginitis? The treatment depends on which type of vaginitis you have. BV is treatable with antibiotics . You may get pills to swallow, or cream or gel that you put in your vagina. During treatment, you should use a condom during sex or not have sex at all. Yeast infections are usually treated with a cream or with medicine that you put inside your vagina. You can buy over-the-counter treatments for yeast infections, but you need to be sure that you do have a yeast infection and not another type of vaginitis. See your health care provider if this is the first time you have had symptoms. Even if you have had yeast infections before, it is a good idea to call your health care provider before using an over-the-counter treatment. The treatment for trichomoniasis is usually a single-dose antibiotic. Both you and your partner(s) should be treated, to prevent spreading the infection to others and to keep from getting it again. If your vaginitis is due to an allergy or sensitivity to a product, you need to figure out which product is causing the problem. It could be a product that you started using recently. Once you figure it out, you should stop using the product. If the cause of your vaginitis is a hormonal change, your health care provider may give you estrogen cream to help with your symptoms. Can vaginitis cause other health problems? It is important to treat BV and trichomoniasis, because having either of them can increase your risk for getting HIV or another STI. If you are pregnant, BV or trichomoniasis can increase your risk for preterm labor and preterm birth. Can vaginitis be prevented? To help prevent vaginitis: Do not douche or use vaginal sprays. Use a latex condom when having sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. Avoid clothes that hold in heat and moisture. Wear cotton underwear.",MedlinePlus

Varicose Veins,https://medlineplus.gov/varicoseveins.html,"Varicose veins are swollen, twisted veins that you can see just under the skin. They usually occur in the legs, but also can form in other parts of the body. Hemorrhoids are a type of varicose vein. Your veins have one-way valves that help keep blood flowing toward your heart. If the valves are weak or damaged, blood can back up and pool in your veins. This causes the veins to swell, which can lead to varicose veins. Varicose veins are very common. You are more at risk if you are older, are female, have obesity, don't exercise, or have a family history of varicose veins. They can also be more common in pregnancy. Doctors often diagnose varicose veins from a physical exam. Sometimes you may need additional tests. Exercising, losing weight, elevating your legs when resting, and not crossing them when sitting can help keep varicose veins from getting worse.

Vascular Diseases,https://medlineplus.gov/vasculardiseases.html,"What are vascular diseases? Your vascular system is your body's network of blood vessels. It includes your: Arteries, which carry oxygen-rich blood from your heart to your tissues and organs Veins, which carry the blood and waste products back to your heart Capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels that connect your small arteries to your small veins. The walls of the capillaries are thin and leaky, to allow for an exchange of materials between your tissues and blood. Vascular diseases are conditions which affect your vascular system. They are common and can be serious. Some types include: Aneurysm - a bulge or ""ballooning"" in the wall of an artery Atherosclerosis - a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Blood clots , including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism Coronary artery disease and carotid artery disease , diseases that involve the narrowing or blockage of an artery. The cause is usually a buildup of plaque. Raynaud phenomenon - a disorder that causes the blood vessels to narrow when you are cold or feeling stressed Stroke - a serious condition that happens when blood flow to your brain stops.

The symptoms for each disease are different. How are vascular diseases diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms and medical history. You may have imaging tests and/or blood tests. How are vascular diseases treated? Which treatment you get depends on which vascular disease you have and how severe it is. Types of treatments for vascular diseases include: Lifestyle changes, such as eating a heart-healthy diet and getting more exercise Medicines, such as blood pressure medicines , blood thinners , cholesterol medicines , and clot-dissolving drugs. In some cases, providers use a catheter to send medicine directly to a blood vessel.

Vasectomy,https://medlineplus.gov/vasectomy.html,"A vasectomy is a type of minor surgery that prevents a man from being able to get a woman pregnant. It is a permanent form of birth control . A vasectomy works by cutting the vas deferens, which are the tubes that carry the sperm out of the testicles. Then the sperm can no longer reach the semen. Semen is the fluid that the penis ejaculates (releases during orgasm). Since there are no sperm, the man cannot get a woman pregnant. The surgery is quick; it usually takes less than 30 minutes. You will probably be able to go home the same day. You may have some discomfort, bruising, and swelling for a few days. In most cases, you will fully recover in less than a week. A vasectomy is one of the most effective forms of birth control. But it takes about three months (or about 20 ejaculations) before it is effective. You will still need to use other birth control until you know that your semen doesn't have any more sperm in it. After two to three months, your health care provider will test your semen to make sure that there are no sperm in it. Having a vasectomy does not affect your sex life. It does not decrease your sex drive. And it will not affect your ability to get an erection or have an orgasm. Vasectomies can sometimes be reversed, but not always. It is done with a procedure to reconnect the vas deferens. Another option if you decide to have children later might be to have sperm taken from your testicles. The sperm could then be used for in vitro fertilization (IVF). However, this may not always work. It's also important to know that both a vasectomy reversal and IVF are expensive.

Viral Infections,https://medlineplus.gov/viralinfections.html,"What are viruses? Viruses are very tiny germs. They are made of genetic material (either DNA or RNA) inside of a protein coating. There are a huge number of viruses on earth. Only a small number of them can infect humans. Those viruses can infect our cells, which may cause disease. Some of the diseases that viruses can cause include the common cold , the flu , COVID-19 , and HIV . How are viruses spread? Viruses can be spread in different ways: Through droplets and particles that are breathed out by someone who has the infection. You might breathe in the droplets or particles, or they could land on your mouth, nose, or eyes. By touching surfaces or objects that have the virus on them and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes. From the pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy . Through contaminated food or water . By being bitten by an infected insect or animal. Through sexual contact (usually vaginal, anal and oral sex) with someone who has the infection. How do viruses cause disease? Viruses are like hijackers. They invade living, normal cells. They then use those cells to multiply (make copies of themselves). This process is also called replication. The process can kill, damage, or change the infected cells. Sometimes this can make you sick. The symptoms can range from mild to very severe. Other times, your immune system may be able to fight it off and you may not have any symptoms. Each different virus usually only infects one type of cell in your body. For example, hepatitis viruses affect the cells in the liver. HIV infects a certain type of immune system cell. What are the treatments for viral infections? For most viral infections, treatments can only help with symptoms while you wait for your immune system to fight off the virus. There are antiviral medicines to treat some viral infections. Antibiotics do not work for viral infections. Can viral infections be prevented? Vaccines can help prevent you from getting many viral diseases. You may be able to prevent some viral infections by: Proper hand washing . Paying attention to food safety . Cleaning surfaces that may be infected with germs. Avoiding contact with wild animals. Preventing insect bites by using insect repellent when you go outdoors. If you travel to an area that has a high risk of diseases from insect bites, also wear long pants, shirts, and socks.

Low vision can't be fixed with glasses, contact lenses , medicine, or surgery. What causes vision impairment? Aging doesn't cause vision loss on its own. But many diseases that are more common in older adults can cause it. The leading causes of low vision and blindness in the United States are age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration , cataracts , and glaucoma . Other eye disorders , eye injuries , and birth defects can also cause vision loss. How is vision impairment diagnosed? Vision impairment is diagnosed with a dilated eye exam . Early warning signs of a vision problem can include not being able to see well enough to: Do everyday tasks like reading and driving Recognize people's faces Tell the difference between colors See the television or computer screen clearly You can have these symptoms even though you are wearing glasses or contacts.

Vitamin D,https://medlineplus.gov/vitamind.html,"Why do I need vitamin D? Vitamins are substances that your body needs to grow and develop normally. Vitamin D is important to your body because: It helps your body absorb calcium . Calcium is one of the main building blocks of bone. A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone diseases such as osteoporosis or rickets . It also has a role in your nerve, muscle, and immune systems: Your muscles need it to move Your nerves need it to carry messages between your brain and your body Your immune system needs vitamin D to fight off bacteria and viruses How do I get vitamin D? You can get vitamin D in three ways: through your skin, from your diet, and from supplements. Your body forms vitamin D naturally after exposure to sunlight . However, too much sun exposure can lead to skin aging and skin cancer . So many people try to get their vitamin D from other sources. Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D. Most people get vitamin D in their diet from foods that are fortified. This means that vitamin D is added to the food. These foods may include milk, cereal, and yogurt. Foods that naturally have vitamin D include egg yolks, saltwater fish, and liver. Vitamin D is available in supplements. It is also included in many multivitamins. The two forms of vitamin D in supplements are D2 and D3. Both types increase vitamin D in your blood, but D3 might raise it higher and for longer than D2. Vitamin D is fat soluble. You can absorb it better when you take your supplements with a meal or snack that includes some fat. How much vitamin D do I need? The amount of vitamin D you need each day depends on your age. The recommended amounts, in international units (IU), are: Birth to 12 months: 400 IU Children 1-13 years: 600 IU Teens 14-18 years: 600 IU Adults 19-70 years: 600 IU Adults 71 years and older: 800 IU If you are pregnant or breastfeeding: 600 IU But certain people may need extra vitamin D, such as: Older adults Breastfed infants People with dark skin People with  certain conditions that limit the absorption of fat, such as Crohn's disease , celiac disease , and ulcerative colitis People who have obesity or have had gastric bypass surgery Check with your health care provider to see if you need to take vitamin D supplements, and if so, how much you should take.

Check with your health care provider about how much you need. What causes vitamin D deficiency? You can become deficient in vitamin D for different reasons: You don't get enough vitamin D in your diet You don't absorb enough vitamin D from food (a malabsorption problem ) You don't get enough exposure to sunlight Your liver or kidneys cannot convert vitamin D to its active form in the body You take medicines that interfere with your body's ability to convert or absorb vitamin D Who is at risk of vitamin D deficiency? Some people are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency: Breastfed infants, because human milk is a poor source of vitamin D. If you are breastfeeding , give your infant a supplement of 400 IU of vitamin D every day. Older adults, because your skin doesn't make vitamin D when exposed to sunlight as efficiently as when you were young, and your kidneys are less able to convert vitamin D to its active form. People with dark skin, which has less ability to produce vitamin D from the sun. People with conditions that make it difficult to absorb nutrients from food, such as Crohn's disease , ulcerative colitis , and celiac disease . People who have obesity , because their body fat binds to some vitamin D and prevents it from getting into the blood. People who have had gastric bypass surgery, a type of weight loss surgery which creates a bypass of part of the small intestine. Since vitamin D is absorbed there, bypassing part of it makes it harder to absorb enough vitamin D. People with chronic kidney or liver disease , which can affect your ability to change vitamin D into a form your body can use. People who take medicines that affect vitamin D levels, including certain cholesterol , anti-seizure, steroid , and weight-loss medicines. Talk with your provider if you are at risk for vitamin D deficiency.  There is a blood test that can measure how much vitamin D is in your body. What problems does vitamin D deficiency cause? Vitamin D deficiency can lead to a loss of bone density , which can contribute to osteoporosis and fractures (broken bones). Severe vitamin D deficiency can also lead to other diseases: In children, it can cause rickets . Rickets is a rare disease that causes the bones to become soft and bend. African American infants and children are at higher risk of getting rickets. In adults, severe vitamin D deficiency leads to osteomalacia. Osteomalacia causes weak bones, bone pain, and muscle weakness. How can I get more vitamin D? There are a few foods that naturally have some vitamin D: Fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel Beef liver Cheese Mushrooms Egg yolks You can also get vitamin D from fortified foods. You can check the food labels to find out whether a food has vitamin D. Foods that often have added vitamin D include: Milk Breakfast cereals Orange juice Other dairy products, such as yogurt Soy drinks Vitamin D is in many multivitamins. There are also vitamin D supplements, both in pills and in a liquid for babies. If you have vitamin D deficiency, the treatment is with supplements. Check with your provider about how much you need to take, how often you need to take it, and how long you need to take it. Can too much vitamin D be harmful? Getting too much vitamin D (known as vitamin D toxicity) can be harmful. Signs of toxicity include nausea and vomiting , poor appetite, constipation , weakness, and weight loss. Very high levels of vitamin D can damage the kidneys. It also raises the level of calcium in your blood. High levels of blood calcium (hypercalcemia) can cause confusion, kidney failure , and irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). Most cases of vitamin D toxicity happen when someone overuses vitamin D supplements. You cannot get too much vitamin D from sun exposure because the skin limits the amount of vitamin D it makes.",MedlinePlus

VLDL Cholesterol,https://medlineplus.gov/vldlcholesterol.html,"What is cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But having too much cholesterol in your blood raises your risk of coronary artery disease . What is VLDL cholesterol? VLDL stands for very-low-density lipoprotein. Your liver makes VLDL and releases it into your bloodstream. The VLDL particles mainly carry triglycerides , another type of fat, to your tissues. VLDL is similar to LDL cholesterol , but LDL mainly carries cholesterol to your tissues instead of triglycerides. VLDL and LDL are sometimes called ""bad"" cholesterols because they can contribute to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. This buildup is called atherosclerosis . The plaque that builds up is a sticky substance made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, the plaque hardens and narrows your arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body. It can lead to coronary artery disease and other heart diseases . How do I know what my VLDL level is? There isn't a way to directly measure your VLDL level. Instead, you will most likely get a blood test to measure your triglyceride level. The lab can use your triglyceride level to estimate what your VLDL level is. Your VLDL is about one-fifth of your triglyceride level. However, estimating your VLDL this way does not work if your triglyceride level is very high. What should my VLDL level be? Your VLDL level should be less than 30 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter). Anything higher than that puts you at risk of heart disease and stroke . How can I lower my VLDL level? Because VLDL and triglycerides are linked, you can lower your VLDL level by lowering your triglyceride level. You may be able to lower your triglycerides with a combination of losing weight, changing your diet, and getting exercise. It is important to switch to healthy fats and cut back on sugar and alcohol. Some people may also need to take medicines.",MedlinePlus

But there are many different factors that can affect weight gain, such as: The world around you. Your home, community, and workplace all may affect how you make daily lifestyle choices. For example: It is often easier to find food and beverages high in calories, sugar, and fat . For instance, vending machines, cafeterias, and special events may not offer healthy, lower calorie options. Less healthy foods may be cheaper than healthier foods. Many people are getting less physical activity because they are spending more time using smartphones and other devices. Families. Overweight and obesity tend to run in families. Overweight and obesity tend to run in families. This suggests that genes may play a role in weight gain. Families may also share eating and lifestyle habits. For example, some families may often have foods and drinks that are high in calories, sugar, and fat. And some families may tend to be less active and spend more time doing things like sitting and watching TV or using computers. Not enough sleep. People who don't get enough sleep may eat more calories and snack more. Emotions. Some people eat when they feel bored, sad, or stressed, even if they are not hungry. Medicines and health conditions.

Whooping Cough,https://medlineplus.gov/whoopingcough.html,"What is whooping cough? Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a respiratory infection that can cause coughing fits. In serious cases, the coughing can become violent and rapid. You may cough so hard that you vomit . The name of the disease comes from the whooping noise you might make when you try to breathe in after coughing. Whooping cough is very contagious and can affect anyone. But it can be especially serious in babies who did not yet get the vaccine. About half of babies under age one who get whooping cough need care in the hospital. What causes whooping cough? Whooping cough is caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. It spreads from person to person. People who have pertussis usually spread it through coughing, sneezing, or breathing very close to someone. It can also sometimes be spread by touching an infected surface and then touching your nose or mouth. If you get pertussis, you are contagious for about 2 weeks after you start coughing. Antibiotics may shorten the time that you are contagious. What are the symptoms of whooping cough? The symptoms of pertussis usually start within 5 to 10 days after you are exposed. But sometimes you may not get symptoms until up to 3 weeks later. Whooping cough usually starts with cold-like symptoms. They may last for 1 to 2 weeks and can include: Runny nose Mild fever Mild, occasional cough The early symptoms in babies can be different. They may only cough a little bit, or they may not cough at all. Babies may have apnea, which means that there is a pause in breathing. They may start to turn blue. If this happens, get medical care for your baby right away. As whopping cough gets worse, the symptoms may include: Fits of many, rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched ""whoop"" sound Vomiting during or after coughing fits Exhaustion after coughing fits The coughing fits get worse and start happening more often, especially at night. You may have them for up to 10 weeks or more. Recovery from this can happen slowly. Your cough gets milder and happens less often. The coughing fits can come back if you have another respiratory infection, even months after you first got whooping cough. How is whooping cough diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose whooping cough : A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A physical exam A lab test which involves taking a sample of mucus from the back of the throat through the nose. This may be done with a swab or syringe filled with saline. The sample is tested for the bacteria that causes whooping cough. Blood test Chest x-ray What are the treatments for whooping cough? The treatment for whooping cough is usually antibiotics. Early treatment is very important. It may make your infection less serious and can also help prevent spreading the disease to others. Treatment after you have been sick for 3 weeks or longer may not help. The bacteria are gone from your body by then, even though you usually still have symptoms. This is because the bacteria have already done damage to your body. Whooping cough can sometimes be very serious and require treatment in the hospital. Can whooping cough be prevented? Vaccines are the best way to prevent whooping cough. There are two vaccines in the United States that can help prevent whooping cough: DTaP and Tdap. These vaccines also provide protection against tetanus and diphtheria . Babies and other people at high risk serious disease should be kept away from people who have whooping cough. Sometimes health care providers give antibiotics to family members of people who have had whooping cough or people who have been exposed to it. The antibiotics may prevent them from getting the disease. You may also help prevent the spread of whooping cough (and other respiratory diseases) by: Washing your hands often with soap and water. You can use an alcohol-based hand rub if soap and water are not available.

Wilson Disease,https://medlineplus.gov/wilsondisease.html,"Wilson disease is a rare inherited disorder that prevents your body from getting rid of extra copper.  You need a small amount of copper from food to stay healthy. Too much copper is poisonous. Normally, your liver releases extra copper into bile, a digestive fluid.  With Wilson disease, the copper builds up in your liver, and it releases the copper directly into your bloodstream. This can cause damage to your brain, kidneys, and eyes. Wilson disease is present at birth, but symptoms usually start between ages 5 and 35. It first attacks the liver, the central nervous system or both. The most characteristic sign is a rusty brown ring around the cornea of the eye. A physical exam and laboratory tests can diagnose it. Treatment is with drugs to remove the extra copper from your body.  You need to take medicine and follow a low-copper diet for the rest of your life. Don't eat shellfish or liver, as these foods may contain high levels of copper.  At the beginning of treatment, you'll also need to avoid chocolate, mushrooms, and nuts. Have your drinking water checked for copper content and don't take multivitamins that contain copper. With early detection and proper treatment, you can enjoy good health.

X-Rays,https://medlineplus.gov/xrays.html,"X-rays are a type of radiation called electromagnetic waves. X-ray imaging creates pictures of the inside of your body. The images show the parts of your body in different shades of black and white. This is because different tissues absorb different amounts of radiation. Calcium in bones absorbs x-rays the most, so bones look white. Fat and other soft tissues absorb less and look gray. Air absorbs the least, so lungs look black. The most familiar use of x-rays is checking for fractures (broken bones), but x-rays are also used in other ways. For example, chest x-rays can spot pneumonia. Mammograms use x-rays to look for breast cancer. When you have an x-ray, you may wear a lead apron to protect certain parts of your body. The amount of radiation you get from an x-ray is small.

Pathology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology,"Pathology is the study of disease. The word pathology also refers to the study of disease in general, incorporating a wide range of biology research fields and medical practices. However, when used in the context of modern medical treatment, the term is often used in a narrower fashion to refer to processes and tests that fall within the contemporary medical field of ""general pathology"", an area that includes a number of distinct but inter-related medical specialties that diagnose disease, mostly through analysis of tissue and human cell samples. Idiomatically, ""a pathology"" may also refer to the predicted or actual progression of particular diseases (as in the statement ""the many different forms of cancer have diverse pathologies"", in which case a more proper choice of word would be ""pathophysiologies""). The suffix pathy is sometimes used to indicate a state of disease in cases of both physical ailment (as in cardiomyopathy) and psychological conditions (such as psychopathy). A physician practicing pathology is called a pathologist. As a field of general inquiry and research, pathology addresses components of disease: cause, mechanisms of development (pathogenesis), structural alterations of cells (morphologic changes), and the consequences of changes (clinical manifestations). In common medical practice, general pathology is mostly concerned with analyzing known clinical abnormalities that are markers or precursors for both infectious and non-infectious disease, and is conducted by experts in one of two major specialties, anatomical pathology and clinical pathology. Further divisions in specialty exist on the basis of the involved sample types (comparing, for example, cytopathology, hematopathology, and histopathology), organs (as in renal pathology), and physiological systems (oral pathology), as well as on the basis of the focus of the examination (as with forensic pathology). Pathology is a significant field in modern medical diagnosis and medical research. The Latin term pathology derives from the Ancient Greek roots pathos (πάθος), meaning ""experience"" or ""suffering"", and -logia (-λογία), meaning ""study of"". The term is of early 16th-century origin, and became increasingly popularized after the 1530s. The study of pathology, including the detailed examination of the body, including dissection and inquiry into specific maladies, dates back to antiquity. Rudimentary understanding of many conditions was present in most early societies and is attested to in the records of the earliest historical societies, including those of the Middle East, India, and China. By the Hellenic period of ancient Greece, a concerted causal study of disease was underway (see Medicine in ancient Greece), with many notable early physicians (such as Hippocrates, for whom the modern Hippocratic Oath is named) having developed methods of diagnosis and prognosis for a number of diseases. The medical practices of the Romans and those of the Byzantines continued from these Greek roots, but, as with many areas of scientific inquiry, growth in understanding of medicine stagnated somewhat after the Classical Era, but continued to slowly develop throughout numerous cultures. Notably, many advances were made in the medieval era of Islam (see Medicine in medieval Islam), during which numerous texts of complex pathologies were developed, also based on the Greek tradition. Even so, growth in complex understanding of disease mostly languished until knowledge and experimentation again began to proliferate in the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Baroque eras, following the resurgence of the empirical method at new centers of scholarship. By the 17th century, the study of rudimentary microscopy was underway and examination of tissues had led British Royal Society member Robert Hooke to coin the word ""cell"", setting the stage for later germ theory.[citation needed] Modern pathology began to develop as a distinct field of inquiry during the 19th Century through natural philosophers and physicians that studied disease and the informal study of what they termed ""pathological anatomy"" or ""morbid anatomy"". However, pathology as a formal area of specialty was not fully developed until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the advent of detailed study of microbiology. In the 19th century, physicians had begun to understand that disease-causing pathogens, or ""germs"" (a catch-all for disease-causing, or pathogenic, microbes, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, amoebae, molds, protists, and prions) existed and were capable of reproduction and multiplication, replacing earlier beliefs in humors or even spiritual agents, that had dominated for much of the previous 1,500 years in European medicine. With the new understanding of causative agents, physicians began to compare the characteristics of one germ's symptoms as they developed within an affected individual to another germ's characteristics and symptoms. This approach led to the foundational understanding that diseases are able to replicate themselves, and that they can have many profound and varied effects on the human host. To determine causes of diseases, medical experts used the most common and widely accepted assumptions or symptoms of their times, a general principle of approach that persists in modern medicine. Modern medicine was particularly advanced by further developments of the microscope to analyze tissues, to which Rudolf Virchow gave a significant contribution, leading to a slew of research developments. By the late 1920s to early 1930s pathology was deemed a medical specialty. Combined with developments in the understanding of general physiology, by the beginning of the 20th century, the study of pathology had begun to split into a number of distinct fields, resulting in the development of a large number of modern specialties within pathology and related disciplines of diagnostic medicine. The modern practice of pathology is divided into a number of subdisciplines within the distinct but deeply interconnected aims of biological research and medical practice. Biomedical research into disease incorporates the work of a vast variety of life science specialists, whereas, in most parts of the world, to be licensed to practice pathology as a medical specialty, one has to complete medical school and secure a license to practice medicine. Structurally, the study of disease is divided into many different fields that study or diagnose markers for disease using methods and technologies particular to specific scales, organs, and tissue types. Anatomical pathology (Commonwealth) or anatomic pathology (United States) is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the gross, microscopic, chemical, immunologic and molecular examination of organs, tissues, and whole bodies (as in a general examination or an autopsy). Anatomical pathology is itself divided into subfields, the main divisions being surgical pathology, cytopathology, and forensic pathology. Anatomical pathology is one of two main divisions of the medical practice of pathology, the other being clinical pathology, the diagnosis of disease through the laboratory analysis of bodily fluids and tissues. Sometimes, pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology, a combination known as general pathology. Cytopathology (sometimes referred to as ""cytology"") is a branch of pathology that studies and diagnoses diseases on the cellular level. It is usually used to aid in the diagnosis of cancer, but also helps in the diagnosis of certain infectious diseases and other inflammatory conditions as well as thyroid lesions, diseases involving sterile body cavities (peritoneal, pleural, and cerebrospinal), and a wide range of other body sites. Cytopathology is generally used on samples of free cells or tissue fragments (in contrast to histopathology, which studies whole tissues) and cytopathologic tests are sometimes called smear tests because the samples may be smeared across a glass microscope slide for subsequent staining and microscopic examination. However, cytology samples may be prepared in other ways, including cytocentrifugation. Dermatopathology is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology that focuses on the skin and the rest of the integumentary system as an organ. It is unique, in that there are two paths a physician can take to obtain the specialization. All general pathologists and general dermatologists train in the pathology of the skin, so the term dermatopathologist denotes either of these who has reached a certain level of accreditation and experience; in the US, either a general pathologist or a dermatologist can undergo a 1 to 2 year fellowship in the field of dermatopathology. The completion of this fellowship allows one to take a subspecialty board examination, and becomes a board certified dermatopathologist. Dermatologists are able to recognize most skin diseases based on their appearances, anatomic distributions, and behavior. Sometimes, however, those criteria do not lead to a conclusive diagnosis, and a skin biopsy is taken to be examined under the microscope using usual histological tests. In some cases, additional specialized testing needs to be performed on biopsies, including immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and molecular-pathologic analysis. One of the greatest challenges of dermatopathology is its scope. More than 1500 different disorders of the skin exist, including cutaneous eruptions (""rashes"") and neoplasms. Therefore, dermatopathologists must maintain a broad base of knowledge in clinical dermatology, and be familiar with several other specialty areas in Medicine. Forensic pathology focuses on determining the cause of death by post-mortem examination of a corpse or partial remains. An autopsy is typically performed by a coroner or medical examiner, often during criminal investigations; in this role, coroners and medical examiners are also frequently asked to confirm the identity of a corpse. The requirements for becoming a licensed practitioner of forensic pathology varies from country to country (and even within a given nation) but typically a minimal requirement is a medical doctorate with a specialty in general or anatomical pathology with subsequent study in forensic medicine. The methods forensic scientists use to determine death include examination of tissue specimens to identify the presence or absence of natural disease and other microscopic findings, interpretations of toxicology on body tissues and fluids to determine the chemical cause of overdoses, poisonings or other cases involving toxic agents, and examinations of physical trauma. Forensic pathology is a major component in the trans-disciplinary field of forensic science.[citation needed] Histopathology refers to the microscopic examination of various forms of human tissue. Specifically, in clinical medicine, histopathology refers to the examination of a biopsy or surgical specimen by a pathologist, after the specimen has been processed and histological sections have been placed onto glass slides. This contrasts with the methods of cytopathology, which uses free cells or tissue fragments. Histopathological examination of tissues starts with surgery, biopsy, or autopsy. The tissue is removed from the body of an organism and then placed in a fixative that stabilizes the tissues to prevent decay. The most common fixative is formalin, although frozen section fixing is also common. To see the tissue under a microscope, the sections are stained with one or more pigments. The aim of staining is to reveal cellular components; counterstains are used to provide contrast. Histochemistry refers to the science of using chemical reactions between laboratory chemicals and components within tissue. The histological slides are then interpreted diagnostically and the resulting pathology report describes the histological findings and the opinion of the pathologist. In the case of cancer, this represents the tissue diagnosis required for most treatment protocols. Neuropathology is the study of disease of nervous system tissue, usually in the form of either surgical biopsies or sometimes whole brains in the case of autopsy. Neuropathology is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology, neurology, and neurosurgery. In many English-speaking countries, neuropathology is considered a subfield of anatomical pathology. A physician who specializes in neuropathology, usually by completing a fellowship after a residency in anatomical or general pathology, is called a neuropathologist. In day-to-day clinical practice, a neuropathologist generates diagnoses for patients. If a disease of the nervous system is suspected, and the diagnosis cannot be made by less invasive methods, a biopsy of nervous tissue is taken from the brain or spinal cord to aid in diagnosis. Biopsy is usually requested after a mass is detected by medical imaging. With autopsies, the principal work of the neuropathologist is to help in the post-mortem diagnosis of various conditions that affect the central nervous system. Biopsies can also consist of the skin. Epidermal nerve fiber density testing (ENFD) is a more recently developed neuropathology test in which a punch skin biopsy is taken to identify small fiber neuropathies by analyzing the nerve fibers of the skin. This test is becoming available in select labs as well as many universities; it replaces the traditional nerve biopsy test as less invasive.[citation needed] Pulmonary pathology is a subspecialty of anatomic (and especially surgical) pathology that deals with diagnosis and characterization of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases of the lungs and thoracic pleura. Diagnostic specimens are often obtained via bronchoscopic transbronchial biopsy, CT-guided percutaneous biopsy, or video-assisted thoracic surgery. These tests can be necessary to diagnose between infection, inflammation, or fibrotic conditions.[citation needed] Renal pathology is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology that deals with the diagnosis and characterization of disease of the kidneys. In a medical setting, renal pathologists work closely with nephrologists and transplant surgeons, who typically obtain diagnostic specimens via percutaneous renal biopsy. The renal pathologist must synthesize findings from traditional microscope histology, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Medical renal diseases may affect the glomerulus, the tubules and interstitium, the vessels, or a combination of these compartments. Surgical pathology is one of the primary areas of practice for most anatomical pathologists. Surgical pathology involves the gross and microscopic examination of surgical specimens, as well as biopsies submitted by surgeons and non-surgeons such as general internists, medical subspecialists, dermatologists, and interventional radiologists. Often an excised tissue sample is the best and most definitive evidence of disease (or lack thereof) in cases where tissue is surgically removed from a patient. These determinations are usually accomplished by a combination of gross (i.e., macroscopic) and histologic (i.e., microscopic) examination of the tissue, and may involve evaluations of molecular properties of the tissue by immunohistochemistry or other laboratory tests.[citation needed] There are two major types of specimens submitted for surgical pathology analysis: biopsies and surgical resections. A biopsy is a small piece of tissue removed primarily for surgical pathology analysis, most often in order to render a definitive diagnosis. Types of biopsies include core biopsies, which are obtained through the use of large-bore needles, sometimes under the guidance of radiological techniques such as ultrasound, CT scan, or magnetic resonance imaging. Incisional biopsies are obtained through diagnostic surgical procedures that remove part of a suspicious lesion, whereas excisional biopsies remove the entire lesion, and are similar to therapeutic surgical resections. Excisional biopsies of skin lesions and gastrointestinal polyps are very common. The pathologist's interpretation of a biopsy is critical to establishing the diagnosis of a benign or malignant tumor, and can differentiate between different types and grades of cancer, as well as determining the activity of specific molecular pathways in the tumor. Surgical resection specimens are obtained by the therapeutic surgical removal of an entire diseased area or organ (and occasionally multiple organs). These procedures are often intended as definitive surgical treatment of a disease in which the diagnosis is already known or strongly suspected, but pathological analysis of these specimens remains important in confirming the previous diagnosis.[citation needed] Clinical pathology is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the laboratory analysis of bodily fluids such as blood and urine, as well as tissues, using the tools of chemistry, clinical microbiology, hematology and molecular pathology. Clinical pathologists work in close collaboration with medical technologists, hospital administrations, and referring physicians. Clinical pathologists learn to administer a number of visual and microscopic tests and an especially large variety of tests of the biophysical properties of tissue samples involving automated analysers and cultures. Sometimes the general term ""laboratory medicine specialist"" is used to refer to those working in clinical pathology, including medical doctors, Ph.D.s and doctors of pharmacology. Immunopathology, the study of an organism's immune response to infection, is sometimes considered to fall within the domain of clinical pathology. Hematopathology is the study of diseases of blood cells (including constituents such as white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) and the tissues, and organs comprising the hematopoietic system. The term hematopoietic system refers to tissues and organs that produce and/or primarily host hematopoietic cells and includes bone marrow, the lymph nodes, thymus, spleen, and other lymphoid tissues. In the United States, hematopathology is a board certified subspecialty (licensed under the American Board of Pathology) practiced by those physicians who have completed a general pathology residency (anatomic, clinical, or combined) and an additional year of fellowship training in hematology. The hematopathologist reviews biopsies of lymph nodes, bone marrows and other tissues involved by an infiltrate of cells of the hematopoietic system. In addition, the hematopathologist may be in charge of flow cytometric and/or molecular hematopathology studies.[citation needed] Molecular pathology is focused upon the study and diagnosis of disease through the examination of molecules within organs, tissues or bodily fluids. Molecular pathology is multidisciplinary by nature and shares some aspects of practice with both anatomic pathology and clinical pathology, molecular biology, biochemistry, proteomics and genetics. It is often applied in a context that is as much scientific as directly medical and encompasses the development of molecular and genetic approaches to the diagnosis and classification of human diseases, the design and validation of predictive biomarkers for treatment response and disease progression, and the susceptibility of individuals of different genetic constitution to particular disorders. The crossover between molecular pathology and epidemiology is represented by a related field ""molecular pathological epidemiology"". Molecular pathology is commonly used in diagnosis of cancer and infectious diseases. Molecular Pathology is primarily used to detect cancers such as melanoma, brainstem glioma, brain tumors as well as many other types of cancer and infectious diseases. Techniques are numerous but include quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), multiplex PCR, DNA microarray, in situ hybridization, DNA sequencing, antibody-based immunofluorescence tissue assays, molecular profiling of pathogens, and analysis of bacterial genes for antimicrobial resistance. Techniques used are based on analyzing samples of DNA and RNA. Pathology is widely used for gene therapy and disease diagnosis. Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology is one of nine dental specialties recognized by the American Dental Association, and is sometimes considered a specialty of both dentistry and pathology. Oral Pathologists must complete three years of post doctoral training in an accredited program and subsequently obtain diplomate status from the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. The specialty focuses on the diagnosis, clinical management and investigation of diseases that affect the oral cavity and surrounding maxillofacial structures including but not limited to odontogenic, infectious, epithelial, salivary gland, bone and soft tissue pathologies. It also significantly intersects with the field of dental pathology. Although concerned with a broad variety of diseases of the oral cavity, they have roles distinct from otorhinolaryngologists (""ear, nose, and throat"" specialists), and speech pathologists, the latter of which helps diagnose many neurological or neuromuscular conditions relevant to speech phonology or swallowing. Owing to the availability of the oral cavity to non-invasive examination, many conditions in the study of oral disease can be diagnosed, or at least suspected, from gross examination, but biopsies, cell smears, and other tissue analysis remain important diagnostic tools in oral pathology.[citation needed] Becoming a pathologist generally requires specialty-training after medical school, but individual nations vary some in the medical licensing required of pathologists. In the United States, pathologists are physicians (D.O. or M.D.) who have completed a four-year undergraduate program, four years of medical school training, and three to four years of postgraduate training in the form of a pathology residency. Training may be within two primary specialties, as recognized by the American Board of Pathology: [anatomical pathology and clinical pathology, each of which requires separate board certification. The American Osteopathic Board of Pathology also recognizes four primary specialties: anatomic pathology, dermatopathology, forensic pathology, and laboratory medicine. Pathologists may pursue specialised fellowship training within one or more subspecialties of either anatomical or clinical pathology. Some of these subspecialties permit additional board certification, while others do not. In the United Kingdom, pathologists are physicians licensed by the UK General Medical Council. The training to become a pathologist is under the oversight of the Royal College of Pathologists. After four to six years of undergraduate medical study, trainees proceed to a two-year foundation program. Full-time training in histopathology currently lasts between five and five and a half years and includes specialist training in surgical pathology, cytopathology, and autopsy pathology. It is also possible to take a Royal College of Pathologists diploma in forensic pathology, dermatopathology, or cytopathology, recognising additional specialist training and expertise and to get specialist accreditation in forensic pathology, pediatric pathology, and neuropathology. All postgraduate medical training and education in the UK is overseen by the General Medical Council. In France, pathology is separated into two distinct specialties, anatomical pathology, and clinical pathology. Residencies for both lasts four years. Residency in anatomical pathology is open to physicians only, while clinical pathology is open to both physicians and pharmacists. At the end of the second year of clinical pathology residency, residents can choose between general clinical pathology and a specialization in one of the disciplines, but they can not practice anatomical pathology, nor can anatomical pathology residents practice clinical pathology. Though separate fields in terms of medical practice, a number of areas of inquiry in medicine and medical science either overlap greatly with general pathology, work in tandem with it, or contribute significantly to the understanding of the pathology of a given disease or its course in an individual. As a significant portion of all general pathology practice is concerned with cancer, the practice of oncology makes extensive use of both anatomical and clinical pathology in diagnosis and treatment. In particular, biopsy, resection, and blood tests are all examples of pathology work that is essential for the diagnoses of many kinds of cancer and for the staging of cancerous masses. In a similar fashion, the tissue and blood analysis techniques of general pathology are of central significance to the investigation of serious infectious disease and as such inform significantly upon the fields of epidemiology, etiology, immunology, and parasitology. General pathology methods are of great importance to biomedical research into disease, wherein they are sometimes referred to as ""experimental"" or ""investigative"" pathology.[citation needed] Medical imaging is the generating of visual representations of the interior of a body for clinical analysis and medical intervention. Medical imaging reveals details of internal physiology that help medical professionals plan appropriate treatments for tissue infection and trauma. Medical imaging is also central in supplying the biometric data necessary to establish baseline features of anatomy and physiology so as to increase the accuracy with which early or fine-detail abnormalities are detected. These diagnostic techniques are often performed in combination with general pathology procedures and are themselves often essential to developing new understanding of the pathogenesis of a given disease and tracking the progress of disease in specific medical cases. Examples of important subdivisions in medical imaging include radiology (which uses the imaging technologies of X-ray radiography) magnetic resonance imaging, medical ultrasonography (or ultrasound), endoscopy, elastography, tactile imaging, thermography, medical photography, nuclear medicine and functional imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography. Though they do not strictly relay images, readings from diagnostics tests involving electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and electrocardiography often give hints as to the state and function of certain tissues in the brain and heart respectively. Pathology informatics is a subfield of health informatics. It is the use of information technology in pathology. It encompasses pathology laboratory operations, data analysis, and the interpretation of pathology-related information. Key aspects of pathology informatics include: Psychopathology is the study of mental illness, particularly of severe disorders. Informed heavily by both psychology and neurology, its purpose is to classify mental illness, elucidate its underlying causes, and guide clinical psychiatric treatment accordingly. Although diagnosis and classification of mental norms and disorders is largely the purview of psychiatry—the results of which are guidelines such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which attempt to classify mental disease mostly on behavioural evidence, though not without controversy—the field is also heavily, and increasingly, informed upon by neuroscience and other of the biological cognitive sciences. Mental or social disorders or behaviours seen as generally unhealthy or excessive in a given individual, to the point where they cause harm or severe disruption to the person's lifestyle, are often called ""pathological"" (e.g., pathological gambling or pathological liar). Although the vast majority of lab work and research in pathology concerns the development of disease in humans, pathology is of significance throughout the biological sciences. Two main catch-all fields exist to represent most complex organisms capable of serving as host to a pathogen or other form of disease: veterinary pathology (concerned with all non-human species of kingdom of Animalia) and phytopathology, which studies disease in plants. Veterinary pathology covers a vast array of species, but with a significantly smaller number of practitioners, so understanding of disease in non-human animals, especially as regards veterinary practice, varies considerably by species. Nevertheless, significant amounts of pathology research are conducted on animals, for two primary reasons: 1) The origins of diseases are typically zoonotic in nature, and many infectious pathogens have animal vectors and, as such, understanding the mechanisms of action for these pathogens in non-human hosts is essential to the understanding and application of epidemiology and 2) those animals that share physiological and genetic traits with humans can be used as surrogates for the study of the disease and potential treatments as well as the effects of various synthetic products. For this reason, as well as their roles as livestock and companion animals, mammals generally have the largest body of research in veterinary pathology. Animal testing remains a controversial practice, even in cases where it is used to research treatment for human disease. As in human medical pathology, the practice of veterinary pathology is customarily divided into the two main fields of anatomical and clinical pathology. Although the pathogens and their mechanics differ greatly from those of animals, plants are subject to a wide variety of diseases, including those caused by fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, viroids, virus-like organisms, phytoplasmas, protozoa, nematodes and parasitic plants. Damage caused by insects, mites, vertebrate, and other small herbivores is not considered a part of the domain of plant pathology. The field is connected to plant disease epidemiology and especially concerned with the horticulture of species that are of high importance to the human diet or other human utility.",Wiki
Pathology_(disambiguation),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology_%28disambiguation%29,Pathology is a medical field specializing in the categorization of diseases. Pathological is the adjective form of the term. Pathology may also refer to:,Wiki
Plant_pathology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_pathology,"Plant pathology or phytopathology is the scientific study of plant diseases caused by pathogens (infectious organisms) and environmental conditions (physiological factors). Plant pathology involves the study of pathogen identification, disease etiology, disease cycles, economic impact, plant disease epidemiology, plant disease resistance, how plant diseases affect humans and animals, pathosystem genetics, and management of plant diseases. Plant pathogens, organisms that cause infectious plant diseases, include fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, viroids, virus-like organisms, phytoplasmas, protozoa, nematodes and parasitic plants. In most plant pathosystems, virulence depends on hydrolases and enzymes that degrade the cell wall. The vast majority of these act on pectins (for example, pectinesterase, pectate lyase, and pectinases). For microbes, the cell wall polysaccharides are both a food source and a barrier to be overcome. Many pathogens grow opportunistically when the host breaks down its own cell walls, most often during fruit ripening. Unlike human and animal pathology, plant pathology usually focuses on a single causal organism; however, some plant diseases have been shown to be interactions between multiple pathogens. To colonize a plant, pathogens have specific pathogenicity factors, of five main types: uses of cell wall–degrading enzymes, toxins, effector proteins, phytohormones, and exopolysaccharides. Some abiotic disorders can be confused with pathogen-induced disorders. Abiotic causes include natural processes such as drought, frost, snow and hail; flooding and poor drainage; nutrient deficiency; deposition of mineral salts such as sodium chloride and gypsum; windburn and breakage by storms; and wildfires. Epidemiology is the study of factors affecting the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases. A disease triangle describes the basic factors required for plant diseases. These are the host plant, the pathogen, and the environment. Any one of these can be modified to control a disease. Plant disease resistance is the ability of a plant to prevent and terminate infections from plant pathogens. Structures that help plants prevent pathogens from entering are the cuticular layer, cell walls, and stomata guard cells. Once pathogens have overcome these barriers, plant receptors initiate signaling pathways to create molecules to compete against the foreign molecules. These pathways are influenced and triggered by genes within the host plant and can be manipulated by genetic breeding to create resistant varieties. Ancient methods of leaf examination and breaking open plant material by hand are now augmented by newer technologies. These include molecular pathology assays such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RT-PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Although PCR can detect multiple molecular targets in a single solution there are limits. Bertolini et al. 2001, Ito et al. 2002, and Ragozzino et al. 2004 developed PCR methods for multiplexing six or seven plant pathogen molecular products and Persson et al. 2005 for multiplexing four with RT-PCR. More extensive molecular diagnosis requires PCR arrays. The primary detection method used worldwide is enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Crop rotation is a traditional and sometimes effective means of preventing a parasitic population from becoming well-established. For example, protection against infection by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which causes gall diseases in many plants, by dipping cuttings in suspensions of Agrobacterium radiobacter before inserting them in the ground to take root. Plant pathology has developed from antiquity, starting with Theophrastus in the ancient era, but scientific study began in the Early Modern period with the invention of the microscope, and developed in the 19th century.",Wiki
Speech–language_pathology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech%E2%80%93language_pathology,"Speech–language pathology, also known as speech and language pathology or logopedics, is a healthcare and academic discipline concerning the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of communication disorders, including expressive and mixed receptive-expressive language disorders, voice disorders, speech sound disorders, speech disfluency, pragmatic language impairments, and social communication difficulties, as well as swallowing disorders across the lifespan. It is an allied health profession regulated by professional bodies including the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and Speech Pathology Australia. The field of speech-language pathology is practiced by a clinician known as a speech–language pathologist (SLP) or a speech and language therapist (SLT). SLPs also play an important role in the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), often in collaboration with pediatricians and psychologists. The development of speech-language pathology into a profession took different paths in the various regions of the world. Three identifiable trends influenced the evolution of speech-language pathology in the United States during the late 19th century to early 20th century: the elocution movement, scientific revolution, and the rise of professionalism. Groups of ""speech correctionists"" formed in the early 1900s. The American Academy of Speech Correction was founded in 1925, which became ASHA in 1978. Speech–language pathologists (SLPs) provide a wide range of services, mainly on an individual basis, but also as support for families, support groups, and providing information for the general public. SLPs work to assess levels of communication needs, make diagnoses based on the assessments, and then treat the diagnoses or address the needs. Speech/language services begin with initial screening for communication or swallowing disorders and continue with assessment and diagnosis, consultation for the provision of advice regarding management, intervention, and treatment, and providing counseling and other followup services for these disorders. Services are provided in the following areas: Speech, language, and swallowing disorders result from a variety of causes, such as a stroke, brain injury, hearing loss, developmental delay, a cleft palate, cerebral palsy, or emotional issues. A common misconception is that speech–language pathology is restricted to the treatment of articulation disorders (e.g., helping English-speaking individuals enunciate the traditionally difficult r) or the treatment of individuals who stutter but, in fact, speech–language pathology is concerned with a broad scope of speech, language, literacy, swallowing, and voice issues involved in communication, some of which include: Primary pediatric speech and language disorders include: receptive and expressive language disorders, speech sound disorders, childhood apraxia of speech (CAS), stuttering, and language-based learning disabilities. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) work with people of all ages. Swallowing disorders include difficulties in any phase of the swallowing process (i.e., oral, pharyngeal, esophageal), as well as functional dysphagia and feeding disorders. Swallowing disorders can occur at any age and can stem from multiple causes. SLPs collaborate with other health care professionals, often working as part of a multidisciplinary team. They can provide information and referrals to audiologists, physicians, dentists, nurses, nurse practitioners, occupational therapists, rehabilitation psychologists, dietitians, educators, behavior consultants (applied behavior analysis), and parents as dictated by the individual client's needs. For example, the treatment for patients with cleft lip and palate often requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Speech–language pathologists can be very beneficial in helping resolve speech problems associated with cleft lip and palate. Research has indicated that children who receive early language intervention are less likely to develop compensatory error patterns later in life, although speech therapy outcomes are usually better when surgical treatment is performed earlier. Another area of collaboration relates to auditory processing disorders, where SLPs can collaborate in assessments and provide intervention where there is evidence of speech, language, and/or other cognitive-communication disorders. SLPs work in a variety of clinical and educational settings. SLPs work in public and private hospitals, private practices, skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), long-term acute care (LTAC) facilities, hospice, and home healthcare. SLPs may also work as part of the support structure in the education system, working in both public and private schools, colleges, and universities. Some SLPs also work in community health, providing services at prisons and young offenders' institutions or providing expert testimony in applicable court cases. Following ASHA's 2005 approval of the delivery of speech/language services via video conference or telepractice, SLPs in the United States have begun to use this service model. Children with speech, language, and communication needs (SLCN) are particularly at risk of not being heard because of communication challenges. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) can explain the significance of supporting communication as a tool for the child to shape and influence choices available to them in their lives, even though it is advised that children with SLCN can and should be actively involved as equal partners in decision-making about their communication needs. Building these skills is especially crucial for SLPs working in settings related to traditional education. SLPs conduct research related to communication sciences and disorders, swallowing disorders, or other upper aerodigestive functions. Experimental, empirical, and scientific methodologies that build on hypothesis testing and logical, deductive reasoning have dominated research in speech-language pathology. Other types of research in the field are complemented by qualitative research. In the United States, speech–language pathologists must hold a master's degree from an ASHA-accredited program. Following graduation and passing a nation-wide board exam, SLPs typically begin their Clinical Fellowship Year, during which they are granted a provisional license and receive guidance from their supervisor. At the end of this process, SLPs may choose to apply for ASHA's Certificate of Clinical Competence and apply for full state licensure. SLPs may additionally choose to earn advanced degrees such as a clinical doctorate in speech–language pathology, PhD, or EdD. Many approaches exist to assess language, communication, speech and swallowing. Two main aspects of assessment can be to determine the extent of breakdown (impairment-level), or how communication can be supported (functional level). When evaluating impairment-based level of breakdown, therapists are trained to use a cognitive neuropsychological approach to assessment, to precisely determine what aspect of communication is impaired. Some therapists use assessments that are based on historic anatomical models of language, that have since been shown to be unreliable. These tools are often preferred by therapists working within a medical model, where medics request a 'type' of impairment, and a 'severity' rating. The broad tools available allow clinicians to precisely select the aspect of communication that they wish to assess. Because school-based speech therapy is run under state guidelines and funds, the process of assessment and qualification is more strict. To qualify for in-school speech therapy, students must meet the state's criteria on language testing and speech standardization. Due to such requirements, some students may not be assessed in an efficient time frame or their needs may be undermined by criteria. For a private clinic, students are more likely to qualify for therapy because it is a paid service with more availability. Speech–language pathologists work with clients and patients who may present with a wide range of issues. In the US, some children are eligible to receive speech therapy services, including assessment and lessons through the public school system. If not, private therapy is readily available through personal lessons with a qualified speech–language pathologist or the growing field of telepractice. Teleconferencing tools such as Skype are being used more commonly as a means to access remote locations in private therapy practice, such as in the geographically diverse south island of New Zealand. More at-home or combination treatments have become readily available to address specific types of articulation disorders. The use of mobile applications in speech therapy is also growing as an avenue to bring treatment into the home. In the UK, children are entitled to an assessment by local NHS speech- and language-therapy teams, usually after referral by health visitors or education settings, but parents are also entitled to request an assessment directly. If treatment is appropriate, an educational plan will be drawn up. Speech therapists often play a role in multi-disciplinary teams when a child has speech delay or disorder as part of a wider health condition. The Children's Commissioner for England reported in June 2019 that there was a postcode lottery; £291.65 a year per head was spent on services in some areas, while the budget in some areas was £30.94 or less. In 2018, 193,971 children in English primary schools were on the special educational needs register needing speech-therapy services. Speech and language therapists work in acute settings and are often integrated into the MDT in multiple areas of speciality for neonatal, children and adult services. Areas include but not limited to; neonatal care, respiratory, ENT, gastrointestinal, stroke, Neurology,ICU, oncology and geriatric care Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease",Wiki
Forensic_pathology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_pathology,"Forensic pathology is pathology that focuses on determining the cause of death by examining a corpse. A post mortem examination is performed by a medical examiner or forensic pathologist, usually during the investigation of criminal law cases and civil law cases in some jurisdictions. Coroners and medical examiners are also frequently asked to confirm the identity of remains. Forensic pathology is an application of medical jurisprudence. A forensic pathologist is a medical doctor who has completed training in anatomical pathology and has subsequently specialized in forensic pathology. The requirements for becoming a ""fully qualified"" forensic pathologist vary from country to country. Some of the different requirements are discussed below (see § Education). The forensic pathologist performs autopsies/postmortem examinations with the goal of determining the cause of death as well as the possible manner of death. The autopsy report contains conclusions made relating to the following: The autopsy also provides an opportunity for other issues raised by the death to be addressed, such as the collection of trace evidence or determining the identity of the deceased. Autopsies are performed when a death occurs, when an unexpected death occurs, when someone dies while not under the care of a physician, to solve criminal cases, when a mass disaster occurs and requires the identification of the victims and upon request by the family or loved ones of the deceased. Typically, autopsies can cost anywhere from $3,000 to $5,000, however the price can vary from country to country. The forensic pathologist examines and documents wounds and injuries, along with the possible causation of those injuries, at autopsy, at the scene of a crime and occasionally in a clinical setting, such as rape investigation or deaths in custody. Forensic pathologists collect and examine tissue specimens under the microscope (histology) to identify the presence or absence of natural disease and other microscopic findings such as asbestos bodies in the lungs or gunpowder particles around a gunshot wound. They collect and interpret toxicological specimens of body tissues and fluids to determine the chemical cause of accidental overdoses or deliberate poisonings. Forensic pathologists work closely with the medico-legal authority for the area concerned with the investigation of sudden and unexpected deaths: the coroner (England and Wales), procurator fiscal (Scotland), or coroner or medical examiner (United States). In mass disaster settings, forensic pathologists will work alongside Forensic Odontologists, Forensics Anthropologists as well as other forensic specialties with the goal of identifying the victims of the disaster. The process of identification involves the recovery of the victims, the collection of antemortem data, the initial examination along with the collection of any postmortem evidence, and finally the comparison of the antemortem and postmortem data gathered in order to identify those victims. They serve as expert witnesses in courts of law testifying in civil or criminal law cases. In an autopsy, the forensic pathologist is often assisted by an autopsy/mortuary technician (sometimes called a diener in the US). Forensic physicians sometimes referred to as ""forensic medical examiners"" or ""police surgeons"" (in the UK until recently), are medical doctors trained in the examination of, and provision of medical treatment to, living victims of assault, including sexual assault, and individuals who find themselves in police custody. Many forensic physicians in the UK practice clinical forensic medicine part-time, and they also practice family medicine or another medical specialty. In the United Kingdom, membership of the Royal College of Pathologists is not a prerequisite of appointment as a coroner's medical expert. Doctors in the UK who are not forensic pathologists or pathologists are allowed to perform medicolegal autopsies, as the wording of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, which merely stipulates a ""registered medical practitioner"": anyone on the General Medical Council register. Forensic pathologists make great contributions to public health and preventative medicine by studying the dead. By using their findings during autopsies, they can use their knowledge to prevent the death of another person. Pathologists determine the cause of death through postmortem examination or autopsy. There are three stages of death investigation: examination, correlation, and interpretation. Deaths where there is an unknown cause and those considered unnatural are investigated. In most jurisdictions this is done by a ""forensic pathologist"", coroner, medical examiner, or hybrid medical examiner-coroner offices. Forensic pathologists must be trained in several fields to succeed at their job. They utilize a wide variety of methods such as conducting autopsies which in itself has a variety of methods. Some of these methods require various identification techniques, including immunohistological studies, which can be valuable for determining the time of injury and assessing axonal damage resulting from traumatic brain injury When conducting an autopsy a forensic pathologist may take X-Rays, samples of bodily fluids, samples of tissues, and samples of bacterial culture found within the body. While conducting the autopsy the forensic pathologist uses the stages of death as another method to inspect both the time of death and the amount of time the body has been deceased. Using the Information received during the autopsy paired with evidence provided by law enforcement provides the basis for the determination of the cause of death. In some jurisdictions, the title of ""Medical Examiner"" is used by a non-physician, elected official involved in a medicolegal death investigation. In others, the law requires the medical examiner to be a physician, pathologist, or forensic pathologist. Similarly, the title ""coroner"" is applied to both physicians and non-physicians. Historically, coroners were not all physicians (most often serving primarily as the town mortician). However, in some jurisdictions, the topic of ""Coroner"" is exclusively used by physicians. In Canada, there was a mix of coroner and medical examiner systems, depending on the province or territory. In Ontario, coroners are licensed physicians, usually but not exclusively family physicians. In Quebec, there is a mix of medical and non-medical coroners, whereas, in British Columbia, there is predominantly a non-physician coroner system. Alberta and Nova Scotia are examples of ME systems In the United States, a coroner is typically an elected public official in a particular geographic jurisdiction who investigates and certifies deaths. The vast majority of coroners lack a Doctor of Medicine degree and the amount of medical training that they have received is highly variable, depending on their profession (e.g. law enforcement, judges, funeral directors, emergency medical technicians, nurses). In contrast, a medical examiner is typically a physician who holds the degree of Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.). Ideally, a medical examiner has completed both a pathology residency and a fellowship in forensic pathology. In some jurisdictions, a medical examiner must be both a doctor and a lawyer, with additional training in forensic pathology. Forensic pathology was founded by Rudolf Virchow, a German pathologist, who developed the Virchow method which is one of the main and popular techniques still used by forensic pathologists today. The Virchow method is of doing autopsies as well as instituting cell theory which would shed light on the effects and damage of disease on the human body. Rudolf Virchow began the practice of regulated autopsies where the entire body would be inspected rather than a particular area of interest which would expose additional damage that injuries and ailments inflicted on the human body. In German-speaking Europe, lectures on forensic pathology were regularly held in Freiburg in the mid 18th century and Vienna in 1804. Scientists like Auguste Ambroise Tardieu, Johann Ludwig Casper and Carl Liman made great efforts to develop forensic pathology into a science based on empirics. Ambroise Paré is also considered one of the fathers of modern forensic pathology and surgery. His inventions in the early 16th century include surgical instruments and techniques. He pioneered battlefield medicine and treatments of wounds. One technique he used was pouring boiling oil into wounds. This history of forensic pathology can be traced all the way back to the fourth century BC in Babylonia but instead of practicing on deceased human bodies, the practice of forensic pathology was strictly practiced on animals. This was said to be done only to animals since humans during this era were believed to be sacred. Later on, in forensic pathology history, forensic pathology would be practiced among those who live in Asia. Muslim doctors would discover infectious diseases and as a result, would operate on deceased bodies; one of those doctors being Ibn Zuhr. Zuhr would go on to performing autopsies on bodies in postmortem and research diseases such as leprosy, mange, and sexually transmitted diseases. While Zuhr was busy learning about contagious diseases, Yee Siung, a Chinese government official was assembling a group of physicians who were in charge of dissecting criminal murder victims. These victims’ cause of death would be investigated alongside the actual case itself and this would be the first time pathology would be used to help solve criminal cases. Forensic pathology was first recognized in the United States by the American Board of Pathology in 1959 after toxicology and pathology had been used to solve thousands of criminal cases worldwide for years. In Canada, it was formally recognized in 2003, and a formal training program (a fellowship) is currently being established under the auspices of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. In most English speaking countries, forensic pathology is a subspecialty of anatomical pathology. Training requirements differ from country to country, however, it is common for pathologists to study at a medical school and then go on to study pathology. Many forensic pathologists practice as a histo (hospital) pathologists before moving onto forensic science. Another requirement for forensic pathologists includes having a working knowledge of specific fields of study like toxicology, firearms examination (wound ballistics), trace evidence, forensic serology and DNA technology. There are currently three paths to qualify as a forensic pathologist in Australia. The first is to train solely in forensic pathology (although a significant amount of anatomical pathology knowledge is still required) and pass two examinations for forensic pathology only. The second is to commence training in anatomical pathology, and complete an initial anatomical pathology examination, which takes a minimum of three years; then go on to train solely in forensic pathology and complete a forensic pathology examination, which takes a minimum of two years. The third is to complete a minimum 5 years' training in anatomical pathology to qualify as a fellow in anatomical pathology, then complete a post-fellowship year in forensic pathology (a minimum twelve months further training plus successful completion of an examination).[citation needed] In Canada, individuals must complete an undergraduate science degree, followed by a doctor of medicine degree from one of the seven medical schools in Canada. After these are completed individuals may enter the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons (RCPSC) which requires the completion of residency training. Anatomical pathology is a five-year residency. Residents who wish to become forensic pathologists must then complete a one-year fellowship in forensic pathology. Forensic pathology is a sub-specialty by the RCPSC. As of 2022, there are three schools in Canada that offer the forensic pathology training program. These schools are the University of Alberta, the University of Ottawa and the University of Toronto. McMaster University ceased their training program in 2019. Once students have acquired the ""Abitur"" diploma and completed all the requirements, they can study medicine at a university. Within the medical education system, there are four subdivisions individuals must partake in prior to moving into a specialization. The first section is a two year preclinical study period where individuals are introduced to the basics. A two month work period at a hospital must be completed between each semester in order to become familiar with everyday life in a hospital. A final exam on the basics concludes this portion. The second section is a one year clinical period to familiarize the students with the basics of clinical practice. The students complete the first part of the physician's exam at the end of this period. The third section is another clinical period which lasts for two years, which practices non-surgical, surgical, neurological, ecological and general medicine domains. Here is where forensic medicine is first introduced. Between the first and second clinical sections, four months of medical clerkship are required, which consists of two months in a hospital and two months at any other medical institution. Students complete the second part of the physician's exam at the end of this period. The final section is a one year practical period where students partake in three 4 month practicums: four months of internal medicine, four months of surgery and four months of clinical practical study of their choice. Students write the final part of the physician's exam before this period and have the oral part afterwards. Once individuals have completed their medical studies, there is a minimum of six extra years of specialization training for forensic pathology. During this training individuals must complete at least three years and six months working for a legal medicine institution, focusing on clinical forensic pathology training. Then, at least one year of pathology work at a specialized institute is required partaking in autopsy technical training. As well, a minimum of 6 months working with forensic psychiatrists is also required. Finally, a single year of work in any field of medicine or legal medicine must be completed. During these work periods, it is required that these physicians write a number of opinions on their post-mortem examinations, crime scene investigations, crime scene reconstructions and insurance medical cases. There is also a minimum number of reports consisting of their own autopsies, police inquiries, histological investigation and other investigative results. Finally, the practicing physician must complete a certain number of oral court proceedings. Once all of this has been completed, an oral examination, overseen by the Chamber of Physicians (also known as the German Medical Association) is to be completed which allows individuals to officially become a forensic pathologist upon completion. In India, the specialty is commonly referred to as Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, or Legal Medicine. After completion of medical graduation (MBBS), one has to complete three years of study and training including thesis research, which leads to the award of a degree of MD (Forensic Medicine). One can also alternately pass the board examination conducted by the National Board of Examinations Archived 2021-06-03 at the Wayback Machine, leading to awarding of Diplomate of National Board (DNB). The majority of the specialists are attached to the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology in various medical colleges. The classification of posts includes Assistant Professor (Lecturer), Associate Professor (Reader), and Professor. The work profile of the specialists includes conducting autopsies and clinical forensic examinations; apart from teaching the medical students. They have to regularly appear in the courts as expert witnesses. A typical department in a government institution conducts 100 to 5,000 autopsies a year depending upon the jurisdiction. Apart from this, clinical forensic examinations constitute a major part of the work and the number of cases can run up to ten thousand a year in an average institution. The largest association of the specialty is Indian Academy of Forensic Medicine (IAFM), which also publishes its quarterly Journal of Indian Academy of Forensic Medicine regularly. This association has a specialist member strength of more than 1000. In Indonesia, forensic medicine, also known as legal medicine (""kedokteran kehakiman""), is a 3-year specialty program that can be taken directly after completing medical school. It is separate from anatomical pathology and clinical pathology. Upon completion of the program, a forensic medicine specialist will obtain the title Spesialis Forensik, or Sp.F. He or she may be addressed in public as Dokter Forensik (""forensic doctor""). Note that there is no pre-medicine program, making the total duration of formal education for one to become a forensic specialist 9 years. It was first introduced through the Dutch colonial criminal justice system in the early twentieth century. Forensic medicine is also a mandatory round during medical school clerkship. Medical students assist the doctors on autopsies, and they may also be allowed to perform an autopsy under supervision, and to witness in the court. In Japan, the profession of forensic pathology is not commonly pursued compared to other medical professions such as clinicians and doctors. In Japan, there are 33 of 42 universities that have a department of pathology established on their campuses yet, even so, only 21 of the 42 universities offer residency programs pertaining to forensic pathology. To become a forensic pathologist, it requires individuals to pursue a four year undergraduate degree. After completing their undergraduate career, it is then required for individuals to attend medical school to either earn their Masters or Doctorates degree. After completing medical school, individuals are then required to have 2 years of mandatory postgraduate clinical education where they learn important clinical skills such as communication skills, common laboratory procedures such as Gram’s stain and urinalysis. When the two year mandatory clinical training is completed, another 3-4 years of training is needed to focus more on surgical procedures which is especially for forensic pathologists. During these last 3–4 years of training, forensic pathologists will learn more about specified human anatomy and they will also have the chance to interact with real patients as well as interacting with other forensic pathologists as well. The department of Forensic Medicine at Kyoto University in Japan has a legacy that can be traced back to 1899 when the department of forensic was first founded. The department has been active forces in promoting the significance of forensic medicine through its innovative programs, research, and analysis. When their training is completed, forensic pathologists in Japan will then have the opportunity to receive their certificate of pathology awarded by the Japanese Society of Pathology In the UK, forensic histopathology is a five/five and a half year training programme, consisting of two and half years of histopathology followed by two and half/three years of forensic histopathology. Successful candidates are eligible for inclusion on the specialist register of the General Medical Council (GMC), which is a requirement to work as a consultant forensic pathologist. Entry to forensic histopathology specialty training requires completion of the UK Foundation Programme, stages A and B of histopathology specialty training, and a pass in the FRCPath Part 1 examination in histopathology. Candidates are in year 3 of specialty training (ST3) when entering forensic histopathology and progress immediately to stage C. Completion of stages C and D, and a pass in the FRCPath Part 2 examination in forensic histopathology allow the candidate to apply for the Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT). Another option is to obtain the full FRCPath in general histopathology, followed by another 18–24 months of training in forensic pathology, which will qualify the candidates with either the Diploma of the Royal College of Pathologists in Forensic Pathology (DipRCPath (forensic)) or the Diploma in Medical Jurisprudence (DMJ). In England and Wales, the candidate will also need to be Home Office Accredited, which will require checks of the training portfolio and completion of a security check and the Expert Witness Training Course run by the Forensic Science Service. Currently approved centres for forensic pathology training in the UK include Belfast, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Leicester, Cardiff, London, Glasgow and Dundee. Not all the posts are currently actively training. In the United States, forensic pathologists typically complete at least one year of additional training (a fellowship) after completing an anatomical pathology residency and having passed the ""board"" examination administered by The American Board of Pathology or The American Osteopathic Board of Pathology (""board-certified""). Becoming an anatomic pathologist in the United States requires completing a residency in anatomic pathology, which is on-the-job training one must perform upon completing medical school before one may practice unsupervised. Anatomic pathology (as it is called) by itself is a three-year residency. Most U.S. pathologists complete a combined residency in both anatomic and clinical pathology, which requires a total of four years. In the United States, all told, the education after high school is typically 13–15 years in duration (4 years of undergraduate training + 4 years of medical school + 4–5 years of residency [anatomic and clinical pathology combined] + 1–2 years of forensic pathology fellowship). Generally, the biggest hurdle is gaining admission to medical school, although the pass rate for anatomic and forensic pathology board examinations (in the U.S.) is approximately 80-90 and 90-100 percent, respectively.

Gumma_(pathology),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumma_%28pathology%29,"A gumma (plural gummata or gummas) is a soft, non-cancerous growth resulting from the tertiary stage of syphilis (and yaws). It is a form of granuloma. Gummas are most commonly found in the liver (gumma hepatis), but can also be found in brain, heart, skin, bone, testis, and other tissues, leading to a variety of potential problems including neurological disorders or heart valve disease. Gummas have a firm, necrotic center surrounded by inflamed tissue, which forms an amorphous proteinaceous mass. The center may become partly hyalinized. These central regions begin to die through coagulative necrosis, though they also retain some of the structural characteristics of previously normal tissues, enabling a distinction from the granulomas of tuberculosis where caseous necrosis obliterates preexisting structures.[citation needed] Other histological features of gummas include an intervening zone containing epithelioid cells with indistinct borders and multinucleated giant cells, and a peripheral zone of fibroblasts and capillaries. Infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells can be seen in the peripheral zone as well. With time, gummas eventually undergo fibrous degeneration, leaving behind an irregular scar or a round fibrous nodule.[citation needed] It is restricted to necrosis involving spirochaetal infections that cause syphilis. Growths that have the appearance of gummas are described as gummatous. In syphilis, the gumma is caused by a reaction to spirochaete bacteria in the tissue. It appears to be the human body's way to slow down the action of this bacteria; it is a unique immune response that develops in humans after the immune system fails to kill off syphilis.[citation needed] The formation of gummata is rare in developed countries, but common in areas that lack adequate medical treatment.[citation needed] Syphilitic gummas are found in most but not all cases of tertiary syphilis, and can occur either singly or in groups. Gummatous lesions are usually associated with long-term syphilitic infection; however, such lesions can also be a symptom of benign late syphilis.[citation needed]",Wiki
Anatomical_pathology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_pathology,"Anatomical pathology (Commonwealth) or anatomic pathology (U.S.) is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the macroscopic, microscopic, biochemical, immunologic and molecular examination of organs and tissues. Over the 20th century, surgical pathology has evolved tremendously: from historical examination of whole bodies (autopsy) to a more modernized practice, centered on the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer to guide treatment decision-making in oncology. Its modern founder was the Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Morgagni from Forlì. Anatomical pathology is one of two branches of pathology, the other being clinical pathology, the diagnosis of disease through the laboratory analysis of bodily fluids or tissues. Often, pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology, a combination known as general pathology. Similar specialties exist in veterinary pathology. Anatomic pathology relates to the processing, examination, and diagnosis of surgical specimens by a physician trained in pathological diagnosis. Clinical pathology involves the laboratory analysis of tissue samples and bodily fluids; procedures may include blood sample analysis, urinalysis, stool sample analysis, and analysis of spinal fluid. Clinical pathologists may specialize in a number of areas, including blood banking, clinical chemistry, microbiology, and hematology. The procedures used in anatomic pathology include: Surgical pathology is the most significant and time-consuming area of practice for most anatomical pathologists. Surgical pathology involves the gross and microscopic examination of surgical specimens, as well as biopsies submitted by non-surgeons such as general internists, medical subspecialists, dermatologists, and interventional radiologists. Surgical pathology increasingly requires technologies and skills traditionally associated with clinical pathology such as molecular diagnostics. In the United States, subspecialty-trained doctors of dentistry, rather than medical doctors, can be certified by a professional board to practice Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. Cytopathology is a sub-discipline of anatomical pathology concerned with the microscopic examination of whole, individual cells obtained from exfoliation or fine-needle aspirates. Cytopathologists are trained to perform fine-needle aspirates of superficially located organs, masses, or cysts and are often able to render an immediate diagnosis in the presence of the patient and consulting physician. In the case of screening tests such as the Papanicolaou smear, non-physician cytotechnologists are often employed to perform initial reviews, with only positive or uncertain cases examined by the pathologist. Cytopathology is a board-certifiable subspecialty in the U.S. Molecular pathology is an emerging discipline within anatomical and clinical pathology that is focused on the use of nucleic acid-based techniques such as in-situ hybridization, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and nucleic acid microarrays for specialized studies of disease in tissues and cells. Molecular pathology shares some aspects of practice with both anatomic and clinical pathology, and is sometimes considered a ""crossover"" discipline. Forensic pathologists receive specialized training in determining the cause of death and other legally relevant information from the bodies of persons who died suddenly with no known medical condition, those who die from non-natural causes, as well as those dying as a result of homicide, or other criminally suspicious deaths. A majority of the forensic pathologists cases are due to natural causes. Often, additional tests such as toxicology, histology, and genetic testing will be used to help the pathologist determine the cause of death. Forensic pathologists will often testify in courts regarding their findings in cases of homicide and suspicious death. They also play a large role in public health, such as investigating deaths in the workplace, deaths in custody, as well as sudden and unexpected deaths in children. Forensic pathologists often have special areas of interest within their practice, such as sudden death due to cardiac pathology, deaths due to drugs, or Sudden Infant Death (SIDS), and various others. Anatomical Pathology is one of the specialty training programs offered by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA). The RCPA. To qualify as a Fellow of the RCPA in Anatomical Pathology, the candidate must complete a recognised undergraduate or postgraduate medical qualification and then complete a minimum of 2 years of clinical medical experience as a prerequisite to selection as a training registrar. The training program is a minimum of 5 years, served in at least two laboratories, and candidates must pass a Basic Pathological Sciences examination (usually in first year), the Part 1 examinations (not before 3rd year) and the Part 2 examinations (not before 5th year). Fellows may then continue into subspecialty training. Anatomical Pathology (AP) is one of the specialist certificates granted by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. Other certificates related to pathology include general pathology (GP), hematopathology, and neuropathology. Candidates for any of these must have completed four years of medical school and five years of residency training. Anatomic Pathology (AP) is one of the two primary certifications offered by the American Board of Pathology (the other is Clinical Pathology (CP)) and one of three primary certifications offered by the American Osteopathic Board of Pathology. To be certified in anatomic pathology, the trainee must complete four years of medical school followed by three years of residency training. Many U.S. pathologists are certified in both AP and CP, which requires a total of four years of residency. After completing residency, many pathologists enroll in further years of fellowship training to gain expertise in a subspecialty of AP or CP. Pathologists' Assistants are highly trained medical professionals with specialized training in Anatomic and Forensic pathology. To become a Pathologists' Assistant one must enter and successfully complete a NAACLS accredited program and pass the ASCP Board of Certification Exam.",Wiki
SA_Pathology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA_Pathology,"SA Pathology, (formerly the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS)), is an organisation providing diagnostic and clinical pathology services throughout South Australia for the public health sector. The headquarters are in Frome Road, Adelaide, and it has many patient collection centres and numerous laboratories located throughout South Australia. The Hanson Centre for Cancer Research was established in 1991 by SA Pathology, broadening its scope of research and becoming the Hanson Institute in 2001. As a not-for-profit organisation, SA Pathology bulk-bills patients for all Medical Benefits Schedule (MBS) pathology tests. In a recent article by Choice magazine, it was recognised as the only consistently ""no gap, bulk billing"" pathology provider in South Australia.[citation needed] The organisation was established as the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS) in the late 1930s. The Institute began as an offshoot of the Royal Adelaide Hospital laboratories, being located in Frome Road nearby, in what used to be South Australia's principal teaching hospital precinct. RAH Superintendent and Dean of Medicine Sir Trent Champion de Crespigny created a combined laboratory services with clinical pathology training and medical research in one facility. Dr. E. Weston Hurst was appointed its first director in 1937, leaving the role in 1943. In the 1970s, the Forensic Pathology and Biology divisions relocated, eventually becoming Forensic Science SA. There was growth and diversification in the 1980s, as the relationships with the RAH and the University of Adelaide were strengthened. Following a review recommending the creation of separate science research laboratories, with new developments being integrated into IMVS and RAH, the Hanson Institute was established in the early 1990s. In 2008 IMVS merged with the pathology department of the Women's and Children's Hospital and Flinders Medical Centre's South Path, with the resulting organisation being renamed SA Pathology. Also in that year, the Centre for Cancer Biology (CCB) was established within SA Pathology. Profits generated from pathology are used to support rural communities, medical training and medical research. SA Pathology has medical researchers studying diseases and disorders ranging from blood, breast and colon cancer, bone fractures, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, hepatitis, infectious diseases and genetic disorders.[citation needed] As a non-profit organisation, SA Pathology bulk-bills patients for all Medical Benefits Schedule (MBS) pathology tests. In a recent article by Choice magazine, it was recognised as the only consistently ""no gap, bulk billing"" pathology provider in South Australia.[citation needed] The Hanson Institute is the research division of the Royal Adelaide Hospital and SA Pathology, which also works in close collaboration with the University of Adelaide. The Hanson Centre for Cancer Research was established in 1991, with funding from the Australian Cancer Research Foundation as well as a grant from the Anti-Cancer Foundation, a South Australian organisation It was constructed within the IMVS building, and combined the research arms of the Human Immunology and Haematology Divisions of the IMVS, both of which specialised in leukaemia research. In 2001 the Hanson Institute was opened, which would cover all cancer research for the IMVS and the RAH and would henceforth include many fields of research in addition to cancer.

Molecular_pathology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_pathology,"Molecular pathology is an emerging discipline within pathology which is focused in the study and diagnosis of disease through the examination of molecules within organs, tissues or bodily fluids. Molecular pathology shares some aspects of practice with both anatomic pathology and clinical pathology, molecular biology, biochemistry, proteomics and genetics, and is sometimes considered a ""crossover"" discipline. It is multi-disciplinary in nature and focuses mainly on the sub-microscopic aspects of disease. A key consideration is that more accurate diagnosis is possible when the diagnosis is based on both the morphologic changes in tissues (traditional anatomic pathology) and on molecular testing. It is a scientific discipline that encompasses the development of molecular and genetic approaches to the diagnosis and classification of human diseases, the design and validation of predictive biomarkers for treatment response and disease progression, the susceptibility of individuals of different genetic constitution to develop disorders. Molecular pathology is commonly used in diagnosis of cancer and infectious diseases. Techniques are numerous but include quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), multiplex PCR, DNA microarray, in situ hybridization, in situ RNA sequencing, DNA sequencing, antibody based immunofluorescence tissue assays, molecular profiling of pathogens, and analysis of bacterial genes for antimicrobial resistance. Integration of ""molecular pathology"" and ""epidemiology"" led to an interdisciplinary field, termed ""molecular pathological epidemiology"" (MPE), which represents integrative molecular biology and population health science.",Wiki
Clinical_pathology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_pathology,"Clinical pathology is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the laboratory analysis of bodily fluids, such as blood, urine, and tissue homogenates or extracts using the tools of chemistry, microbiology, hematology, molecular pathology, and Immunohaematology. This specialty requires a medical residency. Clinical pathology is a term used in the US, UK, Ireland, many Commonwealth countries, Portugal, Brazil, Italy, Japan, and Peru; countries using the equivalent in the home language of ""laboratory medicine"" include Austria, Germany, Romania, Poland and other Eastern European countries; other terms are ""clinical analysis"" (Spain) and ""clinical/medical biology (France, Belgium, Netherlands, North and West Africa). The American Board of Pathology certifies clinical pathologists, and recognizes the following secondary specialties of clinical pathology: In some countries other sub specialities fall under certified Clinical Biologists responsibility: Clinical pathologists are often medical doctors. In some countries in South-America, Europe, Africa or Asia, this specialty can be practiced by non-physicians, such as Ph.D. or Pharm.D. after a variable number of years of residency. Clinical pathologists work in close collaboration with clinical scientists (clinical biochemists, clinical microbiologists, etc.), medical technologists, hospital administrators, and referring physicians to ensure the accuracy and optimal utilization of laboratory testing. Clinical pathology is one of the two major divisions of pathology, the other being anatomical pathology. Often, pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology, a combination sometimes known as general pathology. Similar specialties exist in veterinary pathology. Clinical pathology is itself divided into subspecialties, the main ones being clinical chemistry, clinical hematology/blood banking, hematopathology and clinical microbiology and emerging subspecialties such as molecular diagnostics and proteomics. Many areas of clinical pathology overlap with anatomic pathology. Both can serve as medical directors of CLIA certified laboratories. Under the CLIA law, only the US Department of Health and Human Services approved Board Certified Ph.D., DSc, or MD and DO can perform the duties of a Medical or Clinical Laboratory Director. This overlap includes immunoassays, flow cytometry, microbiology and cytogenetics and any assay done on tissue. Overlap between anatomic and clinical pathology is expanding to molecular diagnostics and proteomics as we move towards making the best use of new technologies for personalized medicine. Clinical pathologists may assist physicians in interpreting complex tests such as platelet aggregometry, hemoglobin or serum protein electrophoresis, or coagulation profiles. If interfering substances are suspected, they may recommend alternate test methods. For example, hemolysis, icterus, lipemia, or heterophile antibodies may confound results obtained by traditional methods such as ion-selective electrodes, enzymatic assays or immunoassays. Alternate methods such as blood gas analysers, point-of-care testing or mass spectrometry may help resolve the clinical question. Recently, EFLM has chosen the name of ""Specialists in Laboratory Medicine"" to define all European Clinical pathologists, regardless of their training (M.D., Ph.D. or Pharm.D.). In France, Clinical Pathology is called Medical Biology (""Biologie médicale"") and is practiced by both M.D.s and Pharm.D.s. The residency lasts four years. Specialists in this discipline are called ""Biologiste médical"" which literally translates as Clinical Biologist rather than ""Clinical pathologist"". Microscopes, analyzers, strips, centrifuges Visual examination of the specimen may provide information to the pathologist or the physician. For example, fluid drained from an abscess may appear cloudy, or cerebrospinal fluid obtained by lumbar puncture may exhibit xanthochromia, suggesting a bleed has occurred. Laboratory technologists may provide qualitative descriptions accordingly. Microscopic analysis is an important activity of the pathologist and the laboratory technologist. They have many different stains at their disposal (GRAM, MGG, Grocott, Ziehl–Neelsen, etc.). Immunofluorescence, cytochemistry, the immunocytochemistry, and FISH are also used in order make a correct diagnosis. Pathologists may review samples such as pleural, peritoneal, synovial, or pericardial fluids to characterize them as ""normal"", tumoral, inflammatory, or even infectious. Microscopic examination can also determine the causal infectious agent – often a bacterium, mould, yeast, parasite, or (rarely) virus. Automated analysers, by the association of robotics and spectrophotometry, have allowed these last decades better reproducibility of the results, in particular in medical biochemistry and hematology. Efficiency and productivity can be enhanced by automating the pre-analytical processing, including barcode reading, sorting, centrifuging, and aliquoting specimens. The analysers must undergo daily controls prior to performing patient testing. Analysers must also undergo daily, weekly and monthly maintenance. Quality management involves reviewing quality control trends to detect emerging problems in instrument calibration, correlating results between instruments that perform similar testing, and running standardized samples to prove linearity and precision. Some laboratory processes involve automated analysis combined with manual review by technologists. For example, when hematology analysers flag samples as abnormal, automated white blood cell differential counts may be superseded by manual differential counts using stained slides read at the microscope or scanned by digital imaging software. Laboratory technologists may flag abnormal samples for pathologist review. The pathologist may recommend additional testing, such as flow cytometry to identify lymphoma or leukemia cells, or cytology to characterize solid tumor cells. Samples undergoing examination for pathogens, primarily in medical microbiology, may be incubated with culture media. Those allow, for example, the description of one or several infectious agents responsible of the clinical signs. Detailed article: Reference range.",Wiki
Biomedicine,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedicine,"Biomedicine (also referred to as Western medicine, mainstream medicine or conventional medicine) is a branch of medical science that applies biological and physiological principles to clinical practice. Biomedicine stresses standardized, evidence-based treatment validated through biological research, with treatment administered via formally trained doctors, nurses, and other such licensed practitioners. Biomedicine also can relate to many other categories in health and biological related fields. It has been the dominant system of medicine in the Western world for more than a century. It includes many biomedical disciplines and areas of specialty that typically contain the ""bio-"" prefix such as molecular biology, biochemistry, biotechnology, cell biology, embryology, nanobiotechnology, biological engineering, laboratory medical biology, cytogenetics, genetics, gene therapy, bioinformatics, biostatistics, systems biology, neuroscience, microbiology, virology, immunology, parasitology, physiology, pathology, anatomy, toxicology, and many others that generally concern life sciences as applied to medicine.[citation needed] Biomedicine is the cornerstone of modern health care and laboratory diagnostics. It concerns a wide range of scientific and technological approaches: from in vitro diagnostics to in vitro fertilisation, from the molecular mechanisms of cystic fibrosis to the population dynamics of the HIV virus, from the understanding of molecular interactions to the study of carcinogenesis, from a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to gene therapy. Biomedicine is based on molecular biology and combines all issues of developing molecular medicine into large-scale structural and functional relationships of the human genome, transcriptome, proteome, physiome and metabolome with the particular point of view of devising new technologies for prediction, diagnosis and therapy. Biomedicine involves the study of (patho-) physiological processes with methods from biology and physiology. Approaches range from understanding molecular interactions to the study of the consequences at the in vivo level. These processes are studied with the particular point of view of devising new strategies for diagnosis and therapy. Depending on the severity of the disease, biomedicine pinpoints a problem within a patient and fixes the problem through medical intervention. Medicine focuses on curing diseases rather than improving one's health. In social sciences biomedicine is described somewhat differently. Through an anthropological lens biomedicine extends beyond the realm of biology and scientific facts; it is a socio-cultural system which collectively represents reality. While biomedicine is traditionally thought to have no bias due to the evidence-based practices, Gaines & Davis-Floyd (2004) highlight that biomedicine itself has a cultural basis and this is because biomedicine reflects the norms and values of its creators. Molecular biology is the process of synthesis and regulation of a cell's DNA, RNA, and protein. Molecular biology consists of different techniques including Polymerase chain reaction, Gel electrophoresis, and macromolecule blotting to manipulate DNA.[citation needed] Polymerase chain reaction is done by placing a mixture of the desired DNA, DNA polymerase, primers, and nucleotide bases into a machine. The machine heats up and cools down at various temperatures to break the hydrogen bonds binding the DNA and allows the nucleotide bases to be added onto the two DNA templates after it has been separated. Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to identify similar DNA between two unknown samples of DNA. This process is done by first preparing an agarose gel. This jelly-like sheet will have wells for DNA to be poured into. An electric current is applied so that the DNA, which is negatively charged due to its phosphate groups is attracted to the positive electrode. Different rows of DNA will move at different speeds because some DNA pieces are larger than others. Thus if two DNA samples show a similar pattern on the gel electrophoresis, one can tell that these DNA samples match. Macromolecule blotting is a process performed after gel electrophoresis. An alkaline solution is prepared in a container. A sponge is placed into the solution and an agarose gel is placed on top of the sponge. Next, nitrocellulose paper is placed on top of the agarose gel and a paper towels are added on top of the nitrocellulose paper to apply pressure. The alkaline solution is drawn upwards towards the paper towel. During this process, the DNA denatures in the alkaline solution and is carried upwards to the nitrocellulose paper. The paper is then placed into a plastic bag and filled with a solution full of the DNA fragments, called the probe, found in the desired sample of DNA. The probes anneal to the complementary DNA of the bands already found on the nitrocellulose sample. Afterwards, probes are washed off and the only ones present are the ones that have annealed to complementary DNA on the paper. Next the paper is stuck onto an x ray film. The radioactivity of the probes creates black bands on the film, called an autoradiograph. As a result, only similar patterns of DNA to that of the probe are present on the film. This allows us the compare similar DNA sequences of multiple DNA samples. The overall process results in a precise reading of similarities in both similar and different DNA sample. Biochemistry is the science of the chemical processes which takes place within living organisms. Living organisms need essential elements to survive, among which are carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, calcium, and phosphorus. These elements make up the four macromolecules that living organisms need to survive: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Carbohydrates, made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, are energy-storing molecules. The simplest carbohydrate is glucose (C6H12O6) which is used in cellular respiration to produce ATP, adenosine triphosphate, which supplies cells with energy.[citation needed] Proteins are chains of amino acids that function, among other things, to contract skeletal muscle, as catalysts, as transport molecules, and as storage molecules. Protein catalysts can facilitate biochemical processes by lowering the activation energy of a reaction. Hemoglobins are also proteins, carrying oxygen to an organism's cells. Lipids, also known as fats, are small molecules derived from biochemical subunits from either the ketoacyl or isoprene groups. Creating eight distinct categories: fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides (derived from condensation of ketoacyl subunits); and sterol lipids and prenol lipids (derived from condensation of isoprene subunits). Their primary purpose is to store energy over the long term. Due to their unique structure, lipids provide more than twice the amount of energy that carbohydrates do. Lipids can also be used as insulation. Moreover, lipids can be used in hormone production to maintain a healthy hormonal balance and provide structure to cell membranes. Nucleic acids are a key component of DNA, the main genetic information-storing substance, found oftentimes in the cell nucleus, and controls the metabolic processes of the cell. DNA consists of two complementary antiparallel strands consisting of varying patterns of nucleotides. RNA is a single strand of DNA, which is transcribed from DNA and used for DNA translation, which is the process for making proteins out of RNA sequences.",Wiki

Generate:Biomedicines,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generate%3ABiomedicines,"Generate:Biomedicines is a biotechnology company founded in 2018 and headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It specializes in using machine learning to design and optimize proteins for therapeutic applications, with a focus on immunology, oncology, and infectious diseases. Generate:Biomedicines was founded in 2018 by Molly Gibson and Gevorg Grigoryan under the support of Flagship Pioneering. The company was established to develop a data-driven approach to understanding the relationship between protein sequence and function with the aim of creating novel proteins for therapeutic purposes. Gibson, trained in computational and systems biology, emphasized the potential of machine learning to replace traditional trial and error drug discovery methods. The company operated in stealth mode until its public unveiling on September 10, 2020. At that time, Generate announced its focus on using machine learning algorithms and big data to design biological compounds targeting multiple diseases, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. Its computational platform integrated vast datasets of protein structures and genetic sequences to develop governing rules for designing new proteins. In March 2021, Mike Nally, formerly of Merck, joined as chief executive officer to advance the company's technology and operational capabilities. Under his leadership, Generate expanded its infrastructure and initiated multiple strategic collaborations. By 2023, Generate had raised financing, including a $273 million Series C round, the largest biotech Series C of the year. These funds supported the company's first-in-human clinical trial for GB-0669, a monoclonal antibody targeting a conserved region of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and its pipeline of 17 programs spanning immunology, infectious disease, and oncology. In September 2024, Generate secured a partnership with Novartis, potentially worth over $1 billion, to leverage its generative artificial intelligence (AI) platform for the development of protein therapeutics. This agreement included $65 million in upfront payments and equity, along with milestone payments and royalties. Generate's research is centered on leveraging machine learning to program proteins for specific functions. Its platform is trained on extensive datasets comprising 160,000 protein structures and 190 million genetic sequences. This system identifies patterns linking protein sequence, structure, and function, which are then used to design new therapeutic proteins. The company's technology includes two core components: de novo protein generation, which allows for the creation of proteins without relying on existing biological templates, and an optimization suite to refine these proteins for therapeutic use. This approach addresses challenges like affinity, immunogenicity, and manufacturability. Generate has applied its platform across various modalities, including antibodies, peptides, enzymes, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Notable research outputs include antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 and preclinical assets in oncology, developed in collaboration with institutions like MD Anderson Cancer Center. To support its experimental work, Generate has invested in advanced facilities, such as a cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) laboratory in Andover, Massachusetts. This lab enables the collection of high-resolution protein interaction data to further train its computational models. Generate's pipeline includes clinical and preclinical candidates addressing conditions like severe asthma and non-small cell lung cancer.

Systems_biomedicine,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biomedicine,"Systems biomedicine, also called systems biomedical science, is the application of systems biology to the understanding and modulation of developmental and pathological processes in humans, and in animal and cellular models. Whereas systems biology aims at modeling exhaustive networks of interactions (with the long-term goal of, for example, creating a comprehensive computational model of the cell), mainly at intra-cellular level, systems biomedicine emphasizes the multilevel, hierarchical nature of the models (molecule, organelle, cell, tissue, organ, individual/genotype, environmental factor, population, ecosystem) by discovering and selecting the key factors at each level and integrating them into models that reveal the global, emergent behavior of the biological process under consideration. Such an approach will be favorable when the execution of all the experiments necessary to establish exhaustive models is limited by time and expense (e.g., in animal models) or basic ethics (e.g., human experimentation). In the year of 1992, a paper on system biomedicine by Kamada T. was published (Nov.-Dec.), and an article on systems medicine and pharmacology by Zeng B.J. was also published (April) in the same time period. In 2009, the first collective book on systems biomedicine was edited by Edison T. Liu and Douglas A. Lauffenburger. In October 2008, one of the first research groups uniquely devoted to systems biomedicine was established at the European Institute of Oncology. One of the first research centers specialized on systems biomedicine was founded by Rudi Balling. The Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine is an interdisciplinary center of the University of Luxembourg.

Regenerative_medicine,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_medicine,"Regenerative medicine deals with the ""process of replacing, engineering or regenerating human or animal cells, tissues or organs to restore or establish normal function"". This field holds the promise of engineering damaged tissues and organs by stimulating the body's own repair mechanisms to functionally heal previously irreparable tissues or organs. Regenerative medicine also includes the possibility of growing tissues and organs in the laboratory and implanting them when the body cannot heal itself. When the cell source for a regenerated organ is derived from the patient's own tissue or cells, the challenge of organ transplant rejection via immunological mismatch is circumvented. This approach could alleviate the problem of the shortage of organs available for donation. Some of the biomedical approaches within the field of regenerative medicine may involve the use of stem cells. Examples include the injection of stem cells or progenitor cells obtained through directed differentiation (cell therapies); the induction of regeneration by biologically active molecules administered alone or as a secretion by infused cells (immunomodulation therapy); and transplantation of in vitro grown organs and tissues (tissue engineering). The ancient Greeks postulated whether parts of the body could be regenerated in the 700s BC. Skin grafting, invented in the late 19th century, can be thought of as the earliest major attempt to recreate bodily tissue to restore structure and function. Advances in transplanting body parts in the 20th century further pushed the theory that body parts could regenerate and grow new cells. These advances led to tissue engineering, and from this field, the study of regenerative medicine expanded and began to take hold. This began with cellular therapy, which led to the stem cell research that is widely being conducted today. The first cell therapies were intended to slow the aging process. This began in the 1930s with Paul Niehans, a Swiss doctor who was known to have treated famous historical figures such as Pope Pius XII, Charlie Chaplin, and king Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia. Niehans would inject cells of young animals (usually lambs or calves) into his patients in an attempt to rejuvenate them. In 1956, a more sophisticated process was created to treat leukemia by inserting bone marrow from a healthy person into a patient with leukemia. This process worked mostly due to both the donor and receiver in this case being identical twins. Nowadays, bone marrow can be taken from people who are similar enough to the patient who needs the cells to prevent rejection. The term ""regenerative medicine"" was first used in a 1992 article on hospital administration by Leland Kaiser. Kaiser's paper closes with a series of short paragraphs on future technologies that will impact hospitals. One paragraph had ""Regenerative Medicine"" as a bold print title and stated, ""A new branch of medicine will develop that attempts to change the course of chronic disease and in many instances will regenerate tired and failing organ systems."" The term was brought into the popular culture in 1999 by William A. Haseltine when he coined the term during a conference on Lake Como, to describe interventions that restore to normal function that which is damaged by disease, injured by trauma, or worn by time. Haseltine was briefed on the project to isolate human embryonic stem cells and embryonic germ cells at Geron Corporation in collaboration with researchers at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. He recognized that these cells' unique ability to differentiate into all the cell types of the human body (pluripotency) had the potential to develop into a new kind of regenerative therapy. Explaining the new class of therapies that such cells could enable, he used the term ""regenerative medicine"" in the way that it is used today: ""an approach to therapy that ... employs human genes, proteins and cells to re-grow, restore or provide mechanical replacements for tissues that have been injured by trauma, damaged by disease or worn by time"" and ""offers the prospect of curing diseases that cannot be treated effectively today, including those related to aging"". Later, Haseltine would go on to explain that regenerative medicine acknowledges the reality that most people, regardless of which illness they have or which treatment they require, simply want to be restored to normal health. Designed to be applied broadly, the original definition includes cell and stem cell therapies, gene therapy, tissue engineering, genomic medicine, personalized medicine, biomechanical prosthetics, recombinant proteins, and antibody treatments. It also includes more familiar chemical pharmacopeia—in short, any intervention that restores a person to normal health. In addition to functioning as shorthand for a wide range of technologies and treatments, the term ""regenerative medicine"" is also patient friendly. It solves the problem that confusing or intimidating language discourages patients. The term regenerative medicine is increasingly conflated with research on stem cell therapies. Some academic programs and departments retain the original broader definition while others use it to describe work on stem cell research. From 1995 to 1998 Michael D. West, PhD, organized and managed the research between Geron Corporation and its academic collaborators James Thomson at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins University that led to the first isolation of human embryonic stem and human embryonic germ cells, respectively. In March 2000, Haseltine, Antony Atala, M.D., Michael D. West, Ph.D., and other leading researchers founded E-Biomed: The Journal of Regenerative Medicine. The peer-reviewed journal facilitated discourse around regenerative medicine by publishing innovative research on stem cell therapies, gene therapies, tissue engineering, and biomechanical prosthetics. The Society for Regenerative Medicine, later renamed the Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Biology Society, served a similar purpose, creating a community of like-minded experts from around the world. In June 2008, at the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Professor Paolo Macchiarini and his team, of the University of Barcelona, performed the first tissue engineered trachea (wind pipe) transplantation. Adult stem cells were extracted from the patient's bone marrow, grown into a large population, and matured into cartilage cells, or chondrocytes, using an adaptive method originally devised for treating osteoarthritis. The team then seeded the newly grown chondrocytes, as well as epithelial cells, into a decellularised (free of donor cells) tracheal segment that was donated from a 51-year-old transplant donor who had died of cerebral hemorrhage. After four days of seeding, the graft was used to replace the patient's left main bronchus. After one month, a biopsy elicited local bleeding, indicating that the blood vessels had already grown back successfully. In 2009, the SENS Foundation was launched, with its stated aim as ""the application of regenerative medicine – defined to include the repair of living cells and extracellular material in situ – to the diseases and disabilities of ageing"". In 2012, Professor Paolo Macchiarini and his team improved upon the 2008 implant by transplanting a laboratory-made trachea seeded with the patient's own cells. On September 12, 2014, surgeons at the Institute of Biomedical Research and Innovation Hospital in Kobe, Japan, transplanted a 1.3 by 3.0 millimeter sheet of retinal pigment epithelium cells, which were differentiated from iPS cells through directed differentiation, into an eye of an elderly woman, who suffers from age-related macular degeneration. In 2016, Paolo Macchiarini was fired from Karolinska University in Sweden due to falsified test results and lies. The TV-show Experimenten aired on Swedish Television and detailed all the lies and falsified results. Widespread interest and funding for research on regenerative medicine has prompted institutions in the United States and around the world to establish departments and research institutes that specialize in regenerative medicine including: The Department of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine at Columbia University, the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at Stanford University, the Center for Regenerative and Nanomedicine at Northwestern University, the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, and the British Heart Foundation Centers of Regenerative Medicine at the University of Oxford. In China, institutes dedicated to regenerative medicine are run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tsinghua University, and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, among others. Regenerative medicine has been studied by dentists to find ways that damaged teeth can be repaired and restored to obtain natural structure and function. Dental tissues are often damaged due to tooth decay, and are often deemed to be irreplaceable except by synthetic or metal dental fillings or crowns, which requires further damage to be done to the teeth by drilling into them to prevent the loss of an entire tooth. Researchers from King's College London have created a drug called Tideglusib that claims to have the ability to regrow dentin, the second layer of the tooth beneath the enamel which encases and protects the pulp (often referred to as the nerve). Animal studies conducted on mice in Japan in 2007 show great possibilities in regenerating an entire tooth. Some mice had a tooth extracted and the cells from bioengineered tooth germs were implanted into them and allowed to grow. The result were perfectly functioning and healthy teeth, complete with all three layers, as well as roots. These teeth also had the necessary ligaments to stay rooted in its socket and allow for natural shifting. They contrast with traditional dental implants, which are restricted to one spot as they are drilled into the jawbone. A person's baby teeth are known to contain stem cells that can be used for regeneration of the dental pulp after a root canal treatment or injury. These cells can also be used to repair damage from periodontitis, an advanced form of gum disease that causes bone loss and severe gum recession. Research is still being done to see if these stem cells are viable enough to grow into completely new teeth. Some parents even opt to keep their children's baby teeth in special storage with the thought that, when older, the children could use the stem cells within them to treat a condition. Extracellular matrix materials are commercially available and are used in reconstructive surgery, treatment of chronic wounds, and some orthopedic surgeries; as of January 2017 clinical studies were under way to use them in heart surgery to try to repair damaged heart tissue. The use of fish skin with its natural constituent of omega 3, has been developed by an Icelandic company Kereceis. Omega 3 is a natural anti-inflammatory, and the fish skin material acts as a scaffold for cell regeneration. In 2016 their product Omega3 Wound was approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic wounds and burns. In 2021 the FDA gave approval for Omega3 Surgibind to be used in surgical applications including plastic surgery. Though uses of cord blood beyond blood and immunological disorders is speculative, some research has been done in other areas. Any such potential beyond blood and immunological uses is limited by the fact that cord cells are hematopoietic stem cells (which can differentiate only into blood cells), and not pluripotent stem cells (such as embryonic stem cells, which can differentiate into any type of tissue). Cord blood has been studied as a treatment for diabetes. However, apart from blood disorders, the use of cord blood for other diseases is not a routine clinical modality and remains a major challenge for the stem cell community. Along with cord blood, Wharton's jelly and the cord lining have been explored as sources for mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), and as of 2015 had been studied in vitro, in animal models, and in early stage clinical trials for cardiovascular diseases, as well as neurological deficits, liver diseases, immune system diseases, diabetes, lung injury, kidney injury, and leukemia.",Wiki

Abiogenesis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis,"Abiogenesis is the natural process by which life arises from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. The prevailing scientific hypothesis is that the transition from non-living to living entities on Earth was not a single event, but a process of increasing complexity involving the formation of a habitable planet, the prebiotic synthesis of organic molecules, molecular self-replication, self-assembly, autocatalysis, and the emergence of cell membranes. The transition from non-life to life has never been observed experimentally, but many proposals have been made for different stages of the process. The study of abiogenesis aims to determine how pre-life chemical reactions gave rise to life under conditions strikingly different from those on Earth today. It primarily uses tools from biology and chemistry, with more recent approaches attempting a synthesis of many sciences. Life functions through the specialized chemistry of carbon and water, and builds largely upon four key families of chemicals: lipids for cell membranes, carbohydrates such as sugars, amino acids for protein metabolism, and nucleic acid DNA and RNA for the mechanisms of heredity. Any successful theory of abiogenesis must explain the origins and interactions of these classes of molecules. Many approaches to abiogenesis investigate how self-replicating molecules, or their components, came into existence. Researchers generally think that current life descends from an RNA world, although other self-replicating and self-catalyzing molecules may have preceded RNA. Other approaches (""metabolism-first"" hypotheses) focus on understanding how catalysis in chemical systems on the early Earth might have provided the precursor molecules necessary for self-replication. The classic 1952 Miller–Urey experiment demonstrated that most amino acids, the chemical constituents of proteins, can be synthesized from inorganic compounds under conditions intended to replicate those of the early Earth. External sources of energy may have triggered these reactions, including lightning, radiation, atmospheric entries of micro-meteorites, and implosion of bubbles in sea and ocean waves. More recent research has found amino acids in meteorites, comets, asteroids, and star-forming regions of space. While the last universal common ancestor of all modern organisms (LUCA) is thought to have existed long after the origin of life, investigations into LUCA can guide research into early universal characteristics. A genomics approach has sought to characterize LUCA by identifying the genes shared by Archaea and Bacteria, members of the two major branches of life (with Eukaryotes included in the archaean branch in the two-domain system). It appears there are 60 proteins common to all life and 355 prokaryotic genes that trace to LUCA; their functions imply that the LUCA was anaerobic with the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, deriving energy by chemiosmosis, and maintaining its hereditary material with DNA, the genetic code, and ribosomes. Although the LUCA lived over 4 billion years ago (4 Gya), researchers believe it was far from the first form of life. Most evidence suggests that earlier cells might have had a leaky membrane and been powered by a naturally occurring proton gradient near a deep-sea white smoker hydrothermal vent; however, other evidence suggests instead that life may have originated inside the continental crust or in water at Earth's surface. Earth remains the only place in the universe known to harbor life. Geochemical and fossil evidence from the Earth informs most studies of abiogenesis. The Earth was formed at 4.54 Gya, and the earliest evidence of life on Earth dates from at least 3.8 Gya from Western Australia. Some studies have suggested that fossil micro-organisms may have lived within hydrothermal vent precipitates dated 3.77 to 4.28 Gya from Quebec, soon after ocean formation 4.4 Gya during the Hadean. Life consists of reproduction with (heritable) variations. NASA defines life as ""a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian [i.e., biological] evolution."" Such a system is complex; the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), presumably a single-celled organism which lived some 4 billion years ago, already had hundreds of genes encoded in the DNA genetic code that is universal today. That in turn implies a suite of cellular machinery including messenger RNA, transfer RNA, and ribosomes to translate the code into proteins. Those proteins included enzymes to operate its anaerobic respiration via the Wood–Ljungdahl metabolic pathway, and a DNA polymerase to replicate its genetic material. The challenge for abiogenesis (origin of life) researchers is to explain how such a complex and tightly interlinked system could develop by evolutionary steps, as at first sight all its parts are necessary to enable it to function. For example, a cell, whether the LUCA or in a modern organism, copies its DNA with the DNA polymerase enzyme, which is itself produced by translating the DNA polymerase gene in the DNA. Neither the enzyme nor the DNA can be produced without the other. The likely answer to this challenge is that the evolutionary process could have involved molecular self-replication, self-assembly such as of cell membranes, and autocatalysis via RNA ribozymes in an RNA world environment. Nonetheless, the transition of non-life to life has never been observed experimentally, nor has there been a satisfactory chemical explanation. The preconditions to the development of a living cell like the LUCA are outlined, though disputed in their details: a habitable world is formed with a supply of minerals and liquid water. Prebiotic synthesis creates a range of simple organic compounds, which are assembled into polymers such as proteins and RNA. On the other side, the process after the LUCA is readily understood: biological evolution caused the development of a wide range of species with varied forms and biochemical capabilities. However, the derivation of living things such as LUCA from simple components is far from understood. Although Earth remains the only place where life is known, the science of astrobiology seeks evidence of life on other planets. The 2015 NASA strategy on the origin of life aimed to solve the puzzle by identifying interactions, intermediary structures and functions, energy sources, and environmental factors that contributed to the diversity, selection, and replication of evolvable macromolecular systems, and mapping the chemical landscape of potential primordial informational polymers. The advent of polymers that could replicate, store genetic information, and exhibit properties subject to selection was, it suggested, most likely a critical step in the emergence of prebiotic chemical evolution. Those polymers derived, in turn, from simple organic compounds such as nucleobases, amino acids, and sugars that could have been formed by reactions in the environment. A successful theory of the origin of life must explain how all these chemicals came into being. One ancient view of the origin of life, from Aristotle until the 19th century, is of spontaneous generation. This held that ""lower"" animals such as insects were generated by decaying organic substances, and that life arose by chance. This was questioned from the 17th century, in works like Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica. In 1665, Robert Hooke published the first drawings of a microorganism. In 1676, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek drew and described microorganisms, probably protozoa and bacteria. Van Leeuwenhoek disagreed with spontaneous generation, and by the 1680s convinced himself, using experiments ranging from sealed and open meat incubation and the close study of insect reproduction, that the theory was incorrect. In 1668 Francesco Redi showed that no maggots appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs. By the middle of the 19th century, spontaneous generation was considered disproven. Dating back to Anaxagoras in the 5th century BC, panspermia is the idea that life originated elsewhere in the universe and came to Earth. The modern version of panspermia holds that life may have been distributed to Earth by meteoroids, asteroids, comets or planetoids. It does not attempt to explain how life originated, but shifts the origin of life to another heavenly body. The advantage is that life is not required to have formed on each planet it occurs on, but rather in a more limited set of locations, or even a single location, and then spread about the galaxy to other star systems via cometary or meteorite impact. Panspermia did not get much scientific support and deflects the need of an answer instead of explaining observable phenomena. Although interest in panspermia grew when traces of organic materials were found in meteorites, it is currently accepted that life started locally on Earth. The idea that life originated from non-living matter in slow stages appeared in Herbert Spencer's 1864–1867 book Principles of Biology, and in William Turner Thiselton-Dyer's 1879 paper ""On spontaneous generation and evolution"". On 1 February 1871 Charles Darwin wrote about these publications to Joseph Hooker, and set out his own speculation, suggesting that the original spark of life may have begun in a ""warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts,—light, heat, electricity &c present, that a protein compound was chemically formed"". Darwin went on to explain that ""at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed."" Alexander Oparin in 1924 and J. B. S. Haldane in 1929 proposed that the first molecules constituting the earliest cells slowly self-organized from a primordial soup, and this theory is called the Oparin–Haldane hypothesis. Haldane suggested that the Earth's prebiotic oceans consisted of a ""hot dilute soup"" in which organic compounds could have formed. J. D. Bernal showed that such mechanisms could form most of the necessary molecules for life from inorganic precursors. In 1967, he suggested three ""stages"": the origin of biological monomers; the origin of biological polymers; and the evolution from molecules to cells. In 1952, Stanley Miller and Harold Urey carried out a chemical experiment to demonstrate how organic molecules could have formed spontaneously from inorganic precursors under prebiotic conditions like those posited by the Oparin–Haldane hypothesis. It used a highly reducing (lacking oxygen) mixture of gases—methane, ammonia, and hydrogen, as well as water vapor—to form simple organic monomers such as amino acids. Bernal said of the Miller–Urey experiment that ""it is not enough to explain the formation of such molecules, what is necessary, is a physical-chemical explanation of the origins of these molecules that suggests the presence of suitable sources and sinks for free energy."" However, current scientific consensus describes the primitive atmosphere as weakly reducing or neutral, diminishing the amount and variety of amino acids that could be produced. The addition of iron and carbonate minerals, present in early oceans, however, produces a diverse array of amino acids. Later work has focused on two other potential reducing environments: outer space and deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Soon after the Big Bang, which occurred roughly 14 Gya, the only chemical elements present in the universe were hydrogen, helium, and lithium, the three lightest atoms in the periodic table. These elements gradually accreted and began orbiting in disks of gas and dust. Gravitational accretion of material at the hot and dense centers of these protoplanetary disks formed stars by the fusion of hydrogen. Early stars were massive and short-lived, producing all the heavier elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. Element formation through stellar nucleosynthesis proceeds to its most stable element Iron-56. Heavier elements were formed during supernovae at the end of a stars lifecycle. Carbon, currently the fourth most abundant chemical element in the universe (after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen), was formed mainly in white dwarf stars, particularly those bigger than twice the mass of the sun. As these stars reached the end of their lifecycles, they ejected these heavier elements, among them carbon and oxygen, throughout the universe. These heavier elements allowed for the formation of new objects, including rocky planets and other bodies. According to the nebular hypothesis, the formation and evolution of the Solar System began 4.6 Gya with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud. Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed. The age of the Earth is 4.54 Gya as found by radiometric dating of calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions in carbonaceous chrondrite meteorites, the oldest material in the Solar System. Earth, during the Hadean eon (from its formation until 4.031 Gya,) was at first inhospitable to any living organisms. During its formation, the Earth lost a significant part of its initial mass, and consequentially lacked the gravity to hold molecular hydrogen and the bulk of the original inert gases. Soon after initial accretion of Earth at 4.48 Ga, its collision with Theia, a hypothesised impactor, is thought to have created the ejected debris that would eventually form the Moon. This impact would have removed the Earth's primary atmosphere, leaving behind clouds of viscous silicates and carbon dioxide. This unstable atmosphere was short-lived and condensed shortly after to form the bulk silicate Earth, leaving behind an atmosphere largely consisting of water vapor, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and sulfur compounds. The solution of carbon dioxide in water is thought to have made the seas slightly acidic, with a pH of about 5.5. Condensation to form liquid oceans is theorised to have occurred as early as the Moon-forming impact. This scenario has found support from the dating of 4.404 Gya zircon crystals with high δ18O values from metamorphosed quartzite of Mount Narryer in Western Australia. The Hadean atmosphere has been characterized as a ""gigantic, productive outdoor chemical laboratory,"" similar to volcanic gases today which still support some abiotic chemistry. Despite the likely increased volcanism from early plate tectonics, the Earth may have been a predominantly water world between 4.4 and 4.3 Gya. It is debated whether or not crust was exposed above this ocean due to uncertainties of what early plate tectonics looked like. For early life to have developed, it is generally thought that a land setting is required, so this question is essential to determining when in Earth's history life evolved. Immediately after the Moon-forming impact, Earth likely had little if any continental crust, a turbulent atmosphere, and a hydrosphere subject to intense ultraviolet light from a T Tauri stage Sun. It was also affected by cosmic radiation, and continued asteroid and comet impacts. Despite all this, niche environments likely existed conducive to life on Earth in the Late-Hadean to Early-Archaean. The Late Heavy Bombardment hypothesis posits that a period of intense impact occurred at 4.1 to 3.8 Gya during the Hadean and early Archean eons. Originally it was thought that the Late Heavy Bombardment was a single cataclysmic impact event occurring at 3.9 Gya; this would have had the potential to sterilise all life on Earth by volatilising liquid oceans and blocking the Sun needed for photosynthesising primary producers, pushing back the earliest possible emergence of life to after the Late Heavy Bombardment. However, more recent research questioned both the intensity of the Late Heavy Bombardment as well as its potential for sterilisation. Uncertainties as to whether Late Heavy Bombardment was one giant impact or a period of greater impact rates greatly changed the implication of its destructive power. The 3.9 Ga date arose from dating of Apollo mission sample returns collected mostly near the Imbrium Basin, biasing the age of recorded impacts. Impact modelling of the lunar surface reveals that rather than a cataclysmic event at 3.9 Ga, multiple small-scale, short-lived periods of bombardment likely occurred. Terrestrial data backs this idea by showing multiple periods of ejecta in the rock record both before and after the 3.9 Ga marker, suggesting that the early Earth was subject to continuous impacts that would not have had as great an impact on extinction as previously thought. If the Late Heavy Bombardment was not a single cataclysmic event, the emergence of life could have taken place far before 3.9 Ga. If life evolved in the ocean at depths of more than ten meters, it would have been shielded both from late impacts and the then high levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Geothermically heated oceanic crust could have yielded far more organic compounds through deep hydrothermal vents than the Miller–Urey experiments indicated. The available energy is maximized at 100–150 °C, the temperatures at which hyperthermophilic bacteria and thermoacidophilic archaea live. The timing at which life emerged on Earth is most likely between 3.48 and 4.32 Gya. Minimum age estimates are based on evidence from the geologic record. In 2017, the earliest physical evidence of life was reported to consist of microbialites in the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt of Northern Quebec, in banded iron formation rocks at least 3.77 and possibly as old as 4.32 Gya. The micro-organisms could have lived within hydrothermal vent precipitates, soon after the 4.4 Gya formation of oceans during the Hadean. The microbes resemble modern hydrothermal vent bacteria, supporting the view that abiogenesis began in such an environment. However, later research disputed this interpretation of the data, stating that the observations may be better explained by abiotic processes in silica-rich waters, ""chemical gardens,"" circulating hydrothermal fluids, or volcanic ejecta. Biogenic graphite has been found in 3.7 Gya metasedimentary rocks from southwestern Greenland and in microbial mat fossils from 3.49 Gya cherts in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Evidence of early life in rocks from Akilia Island, near the Isua supracrustal belt in southwestern Greenland, dating to 3.7 Gya, have shown biogenic carbon isotopes. In other parts of the Isua supracrustal belt, graphite inclusions trapped within garnet crystals are connected to the other elements of life: oxygen, nitrogen, and possibly phosphorus in the form of phosphate, providing further evidence for life 3.7 Gya. In the Pilbara region of Western Australia, compelling evidence of early life was found in pyrite-bearing sandstone in a fossilized beach, with rounded tubular cells that oxidized sulfur by photosynthesis in the absence of oxygen. Carbon isotope ratios on graphite inclusions from the Jack Hills zircons suggest that life could have existed on Earth from 4.1 Gya. The Pilbara region of Western Australia contains the Dresser Formation with rocks 3.48 Gya, including layered structures called stromatolites. Their modern counterparts are created by photosynthetic micro-organisms including cyanobacteria. These lie within undeformed hydrothermal-sedimentary strata; their texture indicates a biogenic origin. Parts of the Dresser formation preserve hot springs on land, but other regions seem to have been shallow seas. A molecular clock analysis suggests the LUCA emerged prior to 3.9 Gya. All chemical elements derive from stellar nucleosynthesis except for hydrogen and some helium and lithium. Basic chemical ingredients of life – the carbon-hydrogen molecule (CH), the carbon-hydrogen positive ion (CH+) and the carbon ion (C+) – can be produced by ultraviolet light from stars. Complex molecules, including organic molecules, form naturally both in space and on planets. Organic molecules on the early Earth could have had either terrestrial origins, with organic molecule synthesis driven by impact shocks or by other energy sources, such as ultraviolet light, redox coupling, or electrical discharges; or extraterrestrial origins (pseudo-panspermia), with organic molecules formed in interstellar dust clouds raining down on to the planet. An organic compound is a chemical whose molecules contain carbon. Carbon is abundant in the Sun, stars, comets, and in the atmospheres of most planets of the Solar System. Organic compounds are relatively common in space, formed by ""factories of complex molecular synthesis"" which occur in molecular clouds and circumstellar envelopes, and chemically evolve after reactions are initiated mostly by ionizing radiation. Purine and pyrimidine nucleobases including guanine, adenine, cytosine, uracil, and thymine have been found in meteorites. These could have provided the materials for DNA and RNA to form on the early Earth. The amino acid glycine was found in material ejected from comet Wild 2; it had earlier been detected in meteorites. Comets are encrusted with dark material, thought to be a tar-like organic substance formed from simple carbon compounds under ionizing radiation. A rain of material from comets could have brought such complex organic molecules to Earth. It is estimated that during the Late Heavy Bombardment, meteorites may have delivered up to five million tons of organic prebiotic elements to Earth per year. Currently 40,000 tons of cosmic dust falls to Earth each year. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are the most common and abundant polyatomic molecules in the observable universe, and are a major store of carbon. They seem to have formed shortly after the Big Bang, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets. They are a likely constituent of Earth's primordial sea. PAHs have been detected in nebulae, and in the interstellar medium, in comets, and in meteorites. A star, HH 46-IR, resembling the sun early in its life, is surrounded by a disk of material which contains molecules including cyanide compounds, hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide. PAHs in the interstellar medium can be transformed through hydrogenation, oxygenation, and hydroxylation to more complex organic compounds used in living cells. Organic compounds introduced on Earth by interstellar dust particles can help to form complex molecules, thanks to their peculiar surface-catalytic activities. The RNA component uracil and related molecules, including xanthine, in the Murchison meteorite were likely formed extraterrestrially, as suggested by studies of 12C/13C isotopic ratios. NASA studies of meteorites suggest that all four DNA nucleobases (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules) have been formed in outer space. The cosmic dust permeating the universe contains complex organics (""amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic–aliphatic structure"") that could be created rapidly by stars. Glycolaldehyde, a sugar molecule and RNA precursor, has been detected in regions of space including around protostars and on meteorites. As early as the 1860s, experiments demonstrated that biologically relevant molecules can be produced from interaction of simple carbon sources with abundant inorganic catalysts. The spontaneous formation of complex polymers from abiotically generated monomers under the conditions posited by the ""soup"" theory is not straightforward. Besides the necessary basic organic monomers, compounds that would have prohibited the formation of polymers were also formed in high concentration during the Miller–Urey experiment and Joan Oró experiments. Biology uses essentially 20 amino acids for its coded protein enzymes, representing a very small subset of the structurally possible products. Since life tends to use whatever is available, an explanation is needed for why the set used is so small. Formamide is attractive as a medium that potentially provided a source of amino acid derivatives from simple aldehyde and nitrile feedstocks. Alexander Butlerov showed in 1861 that the formose reaction created sugars including tetroses, pentoses, and hexoses when formaldehyde is heated under basic conditions with divalent metal ions like calcium. R. Breslow proposed that the reaction was autocatalytic in 1959. Nucleobases, such as guanine and adenine, can be synthesized from simple carbon and nitrogen sources, such as hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and ammonia. Formamide produces all four ribonucleotides when warmed with terrestrial minerals. Formamide is ubiquitous in the Universe, produced by the reaction of water and HCN. It can be concentrated by the evaporation of water. HCN is poisonous only to aerobic organisms (eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria), which did not yet exist. It can play roles in other chemical processes such as the synthesis of the amino acid glycine. DNA and RNA components including uracil, cytosine and thymine can be synthesized under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals such as pyrimidine found in meteorites. Pyrimidine may have been formed in red giant stars or in interstellar dust and gas clouds. All four RNA-bases may be synthesized from formamide in high-energy density events like extraterrestrial impacts. Several ribonucleotides for RNA formation have also been synthesized in a laboratory environment which replicates prebiotic conditions via autocatalytic formose reaction. Other pathways for synthesizing bases from inorganic materials have been reported. Freezing temperatures are advantageous for the synthesis of purines, due to the concentrating effect for key precursors such as hydrogen cyanide. However, while adenine and guanine require freezing conditions for synthesis, cytosine and uracil may require boiling temperatures. Seven amino acids and eleven types of nucleobases formed in ice when ammonia and cyanide were left in a freezer for 25 years. S-triazines (alternative nucleobases), pyrimidines including cytosine and uracil, and adenine can be synthesized by subjecting a urea solution to freeze-thaw cycles under a reductive atmosphere, with spark discharges as an energy source. The explanation given for the unusual speed of these reactions at such a low temperature is eutectic freezing, which crowds impurities in microscopic pockets of liquid within the ice, causing the molecules to collide more often. Prebiotic peptide synthesis is proposed to have occurred through a number of possible routes. Some center on high temperature/concentration conditions in which condensation becomes energetically favorable, while others focus on the availability of plausible prebiotic condensing agents.[further explanation needed] Experimental evidence for the formation of peptides in uniquely concentrated environments is bolstered by work suggesting that wet-dry cycles and the presence of specific salts can greatly increase spontaneous condensation of glycine into poly-glycine chains. Other work suggests that while mineral surfaces, such as those of pyrite, calcite, and rutile catalyze peptide condensation, they also catalyze their hydrolysis. The authors suggest that additional chemical activation or coupling would be necessary to produce peptides at sufficient concentrations. Thus, mineral surface catalysis, while important, is not sufficient alone for peptide synthesis. Many prebiotically plausible condensing/activating agents have been identified, including the following: cyanamide, dicyanamide, dicyandiamide, diaminomaleonitrile, urea, trimetaphosphate, NaCl, CuCl2, (Ni,Fe)S, CO, carbonyl sulfide (COS), carbon disulfide (CS2), SO2, and diammonium phosphate (DAP). An experiment reported in 2024 used a sapphire substrate with a web of thin cracks under a heat flow, similar to the environment of deep-ocean vents, as a mechanism to separate and concentrate prebiotically relevant building blocks from a dilute mixture, purifying their concentration by up to three orders of magnitude. The authors propose this as a plausible model for the origin of complex biopolymers. This presents another physical process that allows for concentrated peptide precursors to combine in the right conditions. A similar role of increasing amino acid concentration has been suggested for clays as well. While all of these scenarios involve the condensation of amino acids, the prebiotic synthesis of peptides from simpler molecules such as CO, NH3 and C, skipping the step of amino acid formation, is very efficient. The largest unanswered question in evolution is how simple protocells first arose and differed in reproductive contribution to the following generation, thus initiating the evolution of life. The lipid world theory postulates that the first self-replicating object was lipid-like. Phospholipids form lipid bilayers in water while under agitation—the same structure as in cell membranes. These molecules were not present on early Earth, but other amphiphilic long-chain molecules also form membranes. These bodies may expand by insertion of additional lipids, and may spontaneously split into two offspring of similar size and composition. Lipid bodies may have provided sheltering envelopes for information storage, allowing the evolution and preservation of polymers like RNA that store information. Only one or two types of amphiphiles have been studied which might have led to the development of vesicles. There is an enormous number of possible arrangements of lipid bilayer membranes, and those with the best reproductive characteristics would have converged toward a hypercycle reaction, a positive feedback composed of two mutual catalysts represented by a membrane site and a specific compound trapped in the vesicle. Such site/compound pairs are transmissible to the daughter vesicles leading to the emergence of distinct lineages of vesicles, which would have allowed natural selection. A protocell is a self-organized, self-ordered, spherical collection of lipids proposed as a stepping-stone to the origin of life. A functional protocell has (as of 2014) not yet been achieved in a laboratory setting. Self-assembled vesicles are essential components of primitive cells. The theory of classical irreversible thermodynamics treats self-assembly under a generalized chemical potential within the framework of dissipative systems. The second law of thermodynamics requires that overall entropy increases, yet life is distinguished by its great degree of organization. Therefore, a boundary is needed to separate ordered life processes from chaotic non-living matter. Irene Chen and Jack W. Szostak suggest that elementary protocells can give rise to cellular behaviors including primitive forms of differential reproduction, competition, and energy storage. Competition for membrane molecules would favor stabilized membranes, suggesting a selective advantage for the evolution of cross-linked fatty acids and even the phospholipids of today. Such micro-encapsulation would allow for metabolism within the membrane and the exchange of small molecules, while retaining large biomolecules inside. Such a membrane is needed for a cell to create its own electrochemical gradient to store energy by pumping ions across the membrane. Fatty acid vesicles in conditions relevant to alkaline hydrothermal vents can be stabilized by isoprenoids which are synthesized by the formose reaction; the advantages and disadvantages of isoprenoids incorporated within the lipid bilayer in different microenvironments might have led to the divergence of the membranes of archaea and bacteria. Laboratory experiments have shown that vesicles can undergo an evolutionary process under pressure cycling conditions.

Firstly, it is the dynamic evolutionary process of natural selection that fits organisms to their environment, enhancing their evolutionary fitness. Secondly, it is a state reached by the population during that process. Thirdly, it is a phenotypic trait or adaptive trait, with a functional role in each individual organism, that is maintained and has evolved through natural selection. Historically, adaptation has been described from the time of the ancient Greek philosophers such as Empedocles and Aristotle. In 18th and 19th-century natural theology, adaptation was taken as evidence for the existence of a deity. Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace proposed instead that it was explained by natural selection. Adaptation is related to biological fitness, which governs the rate of evolution as measured by changes in allele frequencies. Often, two or more species co-adapt and co-evolve as they develop adaptations that interlock with those of the other species, such as with flowering plants and pollinating insects. In mimicry, species evolve to resemble other species; in mimicry this is a mutually beneficial co-evolution as each of a group of strongly defended species (such as wasps able to sting) come to advertise their defences in the same way. Features evolved for one purpose may be co-opted for a different one, as when the insulating feathers of dinosaurs were co-opted for bird flight. Adaptation is a major topic in the philosophy of biology, as it concerns function and purpose (teleology). Some biologists try to avoid terms which imply purpose in adaptation, not least because they suggest a deity's intentions, but others note that adaptation is necessarily purposeful. Adaptation is an observable fact of life accepted by philosophers and natural historians from ancient times, independently of their views on evolution, but their explanations differed. Empedocles did not believe that adaptation required a final cause (a purpose), but thought that it ""came about naturally, since such things survived."" Aristotle did believe in final causes, but assumed that species were fixed. In natural theology, adaptation was interpreted as the work of a deity and as evidence for the existence of God. William Paley believed that organisms were perfectly adapted to the lives they led, an argument that shadowed Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who had argued that God had brought about ""the best of all possible worlds."" Voltaire's satire Dr. Pangloss is a parody of this optimistic idea, and David Hume also argued against design. Charles Darwin broke with the tradition by emphasising the flaws and limitations which occurred in the animal and plant worlds. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed a tendency for organisms to become more complex, moving up a ladder of progress, plus ""the influence of circumstances"", usually expressed as use and disuse. This second, subsidiary element of his theory is what is now called Lamarckism, a proto-evolutionary hypothesis of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, intended to explain adaptations by natural means. Other natural historians, such as Buffon, accepted adaptation, and some also accepted evolution, without voicing their opinions as to the mechanism. This illustrates the real merit of Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, and secondary figures such as Henry Walter Bates, for putting forward a mechanism whose significance had only been glimpsed previously. A century later, experimental field studies and breeding experiments by people such as E. B. Ford and Theodosius Dobzhansky produced evidence that natural selection was not only the 'engine' behind adaptation, but was a much stronger force than had previously been thought. The significance of an adaptation can only be understood in relation to the total biology of the species. Adaptation is primarily a process rather than a physical form or part of a body. An internal parasite (such as a liver fluke) can illustrate the distinction: such a parasite may have a very simple bodily structure, but nevertheless the organism is highly adapted to its specific environment. From this we see that adaptation is not just a matter of visible traits: in such parasites critical adaptations take place in the life cycle, which is often quite complex. However, as a practical term, ""adaptation"" often refers to a product: those features of a species which result from the process. Many aspects of an animal or plant can be correctly called adaptations, though there are always some features whose function remains in doubt. By using the term adaptation for the evolutionary process, and adaptive trait for the bodily part or function (the product), one may distinguish the two different senses of the word. Adaptation is one of the two main processes that explain the observed diversity of species, such as the different species of Darwin's finches. The other process is speciation, in which new species arise, typically through reproductive isolation. An example widely used today to study the interplay of adaptation and speciation is the evolution of cichlid fish in African lakes, where the question of reproductive isolation is complex. Adaptation is not always a simple matter where the ideal phenotype evolves for a given environment. An organism must be viable at all stages of its development and at all stages of its evolution. This places constraints on the evolution of development, behaviour, and structure of organisms. The main constraint, over which there has been much debate, is the requirement that each genetic and phenotypic change during evolution should be relatively small, because developmental systems are so complex and interlinked. However, it is not clear what ""relatively small"" should mean, for example polyploidy in plants is a reasonably common large genetic change. The origin of eukaryotic endosymbiosis is a more dramatic example. All adaptations help organisms survive in their ecological niches. The adaptive traits may be structural, behavioural or physiological. Structural adaptations are physical features of an organism, such as shape, body covering, armament, and internal organization. Behavioural adaptations are inherited systems of behaviour, whether inherited in detail as instincts, or as a neuropsychological capacity for learning. Examples include searching for food, mating, and vocalizations. Physiological adaptations permit the organism to perform special functions such as making venom, secreting slime, and phototropism, but also involve more general functions such as growth and development, temperature regulation, ionic balance and other aspects of homeostasis. Adaptation affects all aspects of the life of an organism. The following definitions are given by the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky: Adaptation differs from flexibility, acclimatization, and learning, all of which are changes during life which are not inherited. Flexibility deals with the relative capacity of an organism to maintain itself in different habitats: its degree of specialization. Acclimatization describes automatic physiological adjustments during life; learning means alteration in behavioural performance during life. Flexibility stems from phenotypic plasticity, the ability of an organism with a given genotype (genetic type) to change its phenotype (observable characteristics) in response to changes in its habitat, or to move to a different habitat. The degree of flexibility is inherited, and varies between individuals. A highly specialized animal or plant lives only in a well-defined habitat, eats a specific type of food, and cannot survive if its needs are not met. Many herbivores are like this; extreme examples are koalas which depend on Eucalyptus, and giant pandas which require bamboo. A generalist, on the other hand, eats a range of food, and can survive in many different conditions. Examples are humans, rats, crabs and many carnivores. The tendency to behave in a specialized or exploratory manner is inherited—it is an adaptation. Rather different is developmental flexibility: ""An animal or plant is developmentally flexible if when it is raised in or transferred to new conditions, it changes in structure so that it is better fitted to survive in the new environment,"" writes the evolutionary biologist John Maynard Smith. If humans move to a higher altitude, respiration and physical exertion become a problem, but after spending time in high altitude conditions they acclimatize to the reduced partial pressure of oxygen, such as by producing more red blood cells. The ability to acclimatize is an adaptation, but the acclimatization itself is not. The reproductive rate declines, but deaths from some tropical diseases also go down. Over a longer period of time, some people are better able to reproduce at high altitudes than others. They contribute more heavily to later generations, and gradually by natural selection the whole population becomes adapted to the new conditions. This has demonstrably occurred, as the observed performance of long-term communities at higher altitude is significantly better than the performance of new arrivals, even when the new arrivals have had time to acclimatize. There is a relationship between adaptedness and the concept of fitness used in population genetics. Differences in fitness between genotypes predict the rate of evolution by natural selection. Natural selection changes the relative frequencies of alternative phenotypes, insofar as they are heritable. However, a phenotype with high adaptedness may not have high fitness. Dobzhansky mentioned the example of the Californian redwood, which is highly adapted, but a relict species in danger of extinction. Elliott Sober commented that adaptation was a retrospective concept since it implied something about the history of a trait, whereas fitness predicts a trait's future. Sewall Wright proposed that populations occupy adaptive peaks on a fitness landscape. To evolve to another, higher peak, a population would first have to pass through a valley of maladaptive intermediate stages, and might be ""trapped"" on a peak that is not optimally adapted. Adaptation is the heart and soul of evolution. Before Darwin, adaptation was seen as a fixed relationship between an organism and its habitat. It was not appreciated that as the climate changed, so did the habitat; and as the habitat changed, so did the biota. Also, habitats are subject to changes in their biota: for example, invasions of species from other areas. The relative numbers of species in a given habitat are always changing. Change is the rule, though much depends on the speed and degree of the change. When the habitat changes, three main things may happen to a resident population: habitat tracking, genetic change or extinction. In fact, all three things may occur in sequence. Of these three effects only genetic change brings about adaptation. When a habitat changes, the resident population typically moves to more suitable places; this is the typical response of flying insects or oceanic organisms, which have wide (though not unlimited) opportunity for movement. This common response is called habitat tracking. It is one explanation put forward for the periods of apparent stasis in the fossil record (the punctuated equilibrium theory). Without mutation, the ultimate source of all genetic variation, there would be no genetic changes and no subsequent adaptation through evolution by natural selection. Genetic change occurs in a population when mutation increases or decreases in its initial frequency followed by random genetic drift, migration, recombination or natural selection act on this genetic variation. One example is that the first pathways of enzyme-based metabolism at the very origin of life on Earth may have been co-opted components of the already-existing purine nucleotide metabolism, a metabolic pathway that evolved in an ancient RNA world. The co-option requires new mutations and through natural selection, the population then adapts genetically to its present circumstances. Genetic changes may result in entirely new or gradual change to visible structures, or they may adjust physiological activity in a way that suits the habitat. The varying shapes of the beaks of Darwin's finches, for example, are driven by adaptive mutations in the ALX1 gene. The coat color of different wild mouse species matches their environments, whether black lava or light sand, owing to adaptive mutations in the melanocortin 1 receptor and other melanin pathway genes. Physiological resistance to the heart poisons (cardiac glycosides) that monarch butterflies store in their bodies to protect themselves from predators are driven by adaptive mutations in the target of the poison, the sodium pump, resulting in target site insensitivity. These same adaptive mutations and similar changes at the same amino acid sites were found to evolve in a parallel manner in distantly related insects that feed on the same plants, and even in a bird that feeds on monarchs through convergent evolution, a hallmark of adaptation. Convergence at the gene-level across distantly related species can arise because of evolutionary constraint. Habitats and biota do frequently change over time and space. Therefore, it follows that the process of adaptation is never fully complete. Over time, it may happen that the environment changes little, and the species comes to fit its surroundings better and better, resulting in stabilizing selection. On the other hand, it may happen that changes in the environment occur suddenly, and then the species becomes less and less well adapted. The only way for it to climb back up that fitness peak is via the introduction of new genetic variation for natural selection to act upon. Seen like this, adaptation is a genetic tracking process, which goes on all the time to some extent, but especially when the population cannot or does not move to another, less hostile area. Given enough genetic change, as well as specific demographic conditions, an adaptation may be enough to bring a population back from the brink of extinction in a process called evolutionary rescue. Adaptation does affect, to some extent, every species in a particular ecosystem. Leigh Van Valen thought that even in a stable environment, because of antagonistic species interactions and limited resources, a species must constantly had to adapt to maintain its relative standing. This became known as the Red Queen hypothesis, as seen in host-parasite interactions. Existing genetic variation and mutation were the traditional sources of material on which natural selection could act. In addition, horizontal gene transfer is possible between organisms in different species, using mechanisms as varied as gene cassettes, plasmids, transposons and viruses such as bacteriophages. In coevolution, where the existence of one species is tightly bound up with the life of another species, new or 'improved' adaptations which occur in one species are often followed by the appearance and spread of corresponding features in the other species. In other words, each species triggers reciprocal natural selection in the other. These co-adaptational relationships are intrinsically dynamic, and may continue on a trajectory for millions of years, as has occurred in the relationship between flowering plants and pollinating insects. Bates' work on Amazonian butterflies led him to develop the first scientific account of mimicry, especially the kind of mimicry which bears his name: Batesian mimicry. This is the mimicry by a palatable species of an unpalatable or noxious species (the model), gaining a selective advantage as predators avoid the model and therefore also the mimic. Mimicry is thus an anti-predator adaptation. A common example seen in temperate gardens is the hoverfly (Syrphidae), many of which—though bearing no sting—mimic the warning coloration of aculeate Hymenoptera (wasps and bees). Such mimicry does not need to be perfect to improve the survival of the palatable species. Bates, Wallace and Fritz Müller believed that Batesian and Müllerian mimicry provided evidence for the action of natural selection, a view which is now standard amongst biologists. All adaptations have a downside: horse legs are great for running on grass, but they cannot scratch their backs; mammals' hair helps temperature, but offers a niche for ectoparasites; the only flying penguins do is under water. Adaptations serving different functions may be mutually destructive. Compromise and makeshift occur widely, not perfection. Selection pressures pull in different directions, and the adaptation that results is some kind of compromise. It is a profound truth that Nature does not know best; that genetical evolution... is a story of waste, makeshift, compromise and blunder. Since the phenotype as a whole is the target of selection, it is impossible to improve simultaneously all aspects of the phenotype to the same degree. Consider the antlers of the Irish elk, (often supposed to be far too large; in deer antler size has an allometric relationship to body size). Antlers serve positively for defence against predators, and to score victories in the annual rut. But they are costly in terms of resources. Their size during the last glacial period presumably depended on the relative gain and loss of reproductive capacity in the population of elks during that time. As another example, camouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid coloration is displayed at mating time. Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the necessity for reproduction. Stream-dwelling salamanders, such as Caucasian salamander or Gold-striped salamander have very slender, long bodies, perfectly adapted to life at the banks of fast small rivers and mountain brooks. Elongated body protects their larvae from being washed out by current. However, elongated body increases risk of desiccation and decreases dispersal ability of the salamanders; it also negatively affects their fecundity. As a result, fire salamander, less perfectly adapted to the mountain brook habitats, is in general more successful, have a higher fecundity and broader geographic range. The peacock's ornamental train (grown anew in time for each mating season) is a famous adaptation. It must reduce his maneuverability and flight, and is hugely conspicuous; also, its growth costs food resources. Darwin's explanation of its advantage was in terms of sexual selection: ""This depends on the advantage which certain individuals have over other individuals of the same sex and species, in exclusive relation to reproduction."" The kind of sexual selection represented by the peacock is called 'mate choice,' with an implication that the process selects the more fit over the less fit, and so has survival value. The recognition of sexual selection was for a long time in abeyance, but has been rehabilitated. The conflict between the size of the human foetal brain at birth, (which cannot be larger than about 400 cm3, else it will not get through the mother's pelvis) and the size needed for an adult brain (about 1400 cm3), means the brain of a newborn child is quite immature. The most vital things in human life (locomotion, speech) just have to wait while the brain grows and matures. That is the result of the birth compromise. Much of the problem comes from our upright bipedal stance, without which our pelvis could be shaped more suitably for birth. Neanderthals had a similar problem. As another example, the long neck of a giraffe brings benefits but at a cost. The neck of a giraffe can be up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in length. The benefits are that it can be used for inter-species competition or for foraging on tall trees where shorter herbivores cannot reach. The cost is that a long neck is heavy and adds to the animal's body mass, requiring additional energy to build the neck and to carry its weight around. Adaptation and function are two aspects of one problem. Pre-adaptation occurs when a population has characteristics which by chance are suited for a set of conditions not previously experienced. For example, the polyploid cordgrass Spartina townsendii is better adapted than either of its parent species to their own habitat of saline marsh and mud-flats. Among domestic animals, the White Leghorn chicken is markedly more resistant to vitamin B1 deficiency than other breeds; on a plentiful diet this makes no difference, but on a restricted diet this preadaptation could be decisive. Pre-adaptation may arise because a natural population carries a huge quantity of genetic variability. In diploid eukaryotes, this is a consequence of the system of sexual reproduction, where mutant alleles get partially shielded, for example, by genetic dominance. Microorganisms, with their huge populations, also carry a great deal of genetic variability. The first experimental evidence of the pre-adaptive nature of genetic variants in microorganisms was provided by Salvador Luria and Max Delbrück who developed the Fluctuation Test, a method to show the random fluctuation of pre-existing genetic changes that conferred resistance to bacteriophages in Escherichia coli. The word is controversial because it is teleological and the entire concept of natural selection depends on the presence of genetic variation, regardless of the population size of a species in question. Features that now appear as adaptations sometimes arose by co-option of existing traits, evolved for some other purpose. The classic example is the ear ossicles of mammals, which we know from paleontological and embryological evidence originated in the upper and lower jaws and the hyoid bone of their synapsid ancestors, and further back still were part of the gill arches of early fish. The word exaptation was coined to cover these common evolutionary shifts in function. The flight feathers of birds evolved from the much earlier feathers of dinosaurs, which might have been used for insulation or for display. Animals including earthworms, beavers and humans use some of their adaptations to modify their surroundings, so as to maximize their chances of surviving and reproducing. Beavers create dams and lodges, changing the ecosystems of the valleys around them. Earthworms, as Darwin noted, improve the topsoil in which they live by incorporating organic matter. Humans have constructed extensive civilizations with cities in environments as varied as the Arctic and hot deserts. In all three cases, the construction and maintenance of ecological niches helps drive the continued selection of the genes of these animals, in an environment that the animals have modified. Some traits do not appear to be adaptive as they have a neutral or deleterious effect on fitness in the current environment. Because genes often have pleiotropic effects, not all traits may be functional: they may be what Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin called spandrels, features brought about by neighbouring adaptations, on the analogy with the often highly decorated triangular areas between pairs of arches in architecture, which began as functionless features. Another possibility is that a trait may have been adaptive at some point in an organism's evolutionary history, but a change in habitats caused what used to be an adaptation to become unnecessary or even maladapted. Such adaptations are termed vestigial. Many organisms have vestigial organs, which are the remnants of fully functional structures in their ancestors. As a result of changes in lifestyle the organs became redundant, and are either not functional or reduced in functionality. Since any structure represents some kind of cost to the general economy of the body, an advantage may accrue from their elimination once they are not functional. Examples: wisdom teeth in humans; the loss of pigment and functional eyes in cave fauna; the loss of structure in endoparasites. If a population cannot move or change sufficiently to preserve its long-term viability, then it will become extinct, at least in that locale. The species may or may not survive in other locales. Species extinction occurs when the death rate over the entire species exceeds the birth rate for a long enough period for the species to disappear. It was an observation of Van Valen that groups of species tend to have a characteristic and fairly regular rate of extinction. Just as there is co-adaptation, there is also coextinction, the loss of a species due to the extinction of another with which it is coadapted, as with the extinction of a parasitic insect following the loss of its host, or when a flowering plant loses its pollinator, or when a food chain is disrupted. The first stage in the evolution of life on earth is often hypothesized to be the RNA world in which short self-replicating RNA molecules proliferated before the evolution of DNA and proteins. By this hypothesis, life started when RNA chains began to self-replicate, initiating the three mechanisms of Darwinian selection: heritability, variation of type, and competition for resources. The fitness of an RNA replicator (its per capita rate of increase) would likely have been a function of its intrinsic adaptive capacities, determined by its nucleotide sequence, and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities may have been: (1) replication with moderate fidelity, giving rise to heritability while allowing variation of type, (2) resistance to decay, and (3) acquisition of resources. These adaptive capacities would have been determined by the folded configurations of the RNA replicators resulting from their nucleotide sequences. Adaptation raises philosophical issues concerning how biologists speak of function and purpose, as this carries implications of evolutionary history – that a feature evolved by natural selection for a specific reason – and potentially of supernatural intervention – that features and organisms exist because of a deity's conscious intentions. In his biology, Aristotle introduced teleology to describe the adaptedness of organisms, but without accepting the supernatural intention built into Plato's thinking, which Aristotle rejected. Modern biologists continue to face the same difficulty. On the one hand, adaptation is purposeful: natural selection chooses what works and eliminates what does not. On the other hand, biologists by and large reject conscious purpose in evolution. The dilemma gave rise to a famous joke by the evolutionary biologist Haldane: ""Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he's unwilling to be seen with her in public.'"" David Hull commented that Haldane's mistress ""has become a lawfully wedded wife. Biologists no longer feel obligated to apologize for their use of teleological language; they flaunt it."" Ernst Mayr stated that ""adaptedness... is an a posteriori result rather than an a priori goal-seeking"", meaning that the question of whether something is an adaptation can only be determined after the event.",Wiki
Addiction_medicine,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction_medicine,"Addiction medicine is a medical subspecialty that deals with the diagnosis, prevention, evaluation, treatment, and recovery of persons with addiction, of those with substance-related and addictive disorders, and of people who show unhealthy use of substances including alcohol, nicotine, prescription medicine and other illicit and licit drugs. The medical subspecialty often crosses over into other areas, since various aspects of addiction fall within the fields of public health, psychology, social work, mental health counseling, psychiatry, and internal medicine, among others. Incorporated within the specialty are the processes of detoxification, rehabilitation, harm reduction, abstinence-based treatment, individual and group therapies, oversight of halfway houses, treatment of withdrawal-related symptoms, acute intervention, and long term therapies designed to reduce likelihood of relapse. Some specialists, primarily those who also have expertise in family medicine or internal medicine, also provide treatment for disease states commonly associated with substance use, such as hepatitis and HIV infection. Physicians specializing in the field are in general agreement concerning applicability of treatment to those with addiction to drugs, such as alcohol and heroin, and often also to gambling, which has similar characteristics and has been well-described in the scientific literature. There is less agreement concerning definition or treatment of other so-called addictive behavior such as sexual addiction and internet addiction, such behaviors not being marked generally by physiologic tolerance or withdrawal. Over centuries, addiction has been recognized as an issue to be treated, and has been addressed with the creation of a multitude of organizations, the passage of certain acts, and the development of various drugs in the medical field all to help those who struggle with addiction. Doctors focusing on addiction medicine are medical specialists who focus on addictive disease and have had special study and training focusing on the prevention and treatment of such diseases. There are two routes to specialization in the addiction field: one via a psychiatric pathway and one via other fields of medicine. The American Society of Addiction Medicine notes that approximately 40% of its members are psychiatrists (MD/DO) while the remainder have received primary medical training in other fields.[failed verification] Addiction first became well known and seen as a major issue between the 1750s and early 1800s with alcoholism running rampant and being the main contributor to this. Dr. Benjamin rush first began to discern alcoholism as an illness to be addressed when he published his writing “Inquiry into the Effects of Ardent Spirits on the Human Mind and Body” in 1784. Because of his writing of alcoholism, the beginnings of the temperance movement came shortly after in the early 1800s. The first inebriate homes for alcoholics opened around the 1850s. These homes and asylums provided a segregated place for alcoholics to stay while they withdrew from the alcohol, along with integration into sobriety groups. In 1864, Dr. Joseph Edward Turner opened the New York State Inebriate Asylum, which was the first rehabilitation center for alcoholism. In the late 1800s, around 1890, alcoholics were sent to hospital wards and drunk tanks, as inebriate homes began shutting down. Throughout the first half of the 1900s, many hospitals and organizations opened to assist addicts, such as the Charles B. Towns substance abuse Hospital (1901), the Emmanuel Clinic/the Emmanuel movement (1906), morphine maintenance clinics (1919-1924), narcotics farms (1935), Alcoholics Anonymous (1935), etc. In addition to this, certain state laws were passed to try to sterilize disabled people, addicts, and people with mental disorders (1910). During this time, various drugs also came out to attempt to cure alcoholism like barbiturates, amphetamines, LSD, and disulfiram (1948-1950). Within these years, multiple advancements were made, certain laws or acts were passed, and more organizations came about to help people with addiction. In 1957, treatment units for alcoholics were developed by the Veterans Administration. Shortly thereafter, a multitude of associations opened. These include but are not limited to the Halfway House Association (1958), the Betty Ford Clinic (1982), Cocaine Anonymous (1982), Secular Organizations for Sobriety and Rational Recovery (1985-1986), and SMART Recovery (1994). Along with that, drugs like methadone (1964), Narcan (1971), and naltrexone (1994), were developed to fight against opioid withdrawal and alcoholism. As for the legal side of things, the Controlled Substances Act passed in 1970, which classified all controlled substances into five classes, and the Drug Addiction Treatment Act passed in 1999, enforcing a stricter version of the Controlled Substances Act. In the past 25 years, further developments have been made in the field of addiction medicine such as the FDA approval of a treatment called buprenorphine for opioid addicts, along with The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (2008) and the Affordable Care Act (2010) being passed. The MHPAEA of 2008 made it mandatory for insurance organizations to give people coverage for the cost of substance abuse related treatments, while the ACA of 2010 further expanded the coverage offered for substance abuse related treatments through state health insurances. To become an addiction specialist, one would typically obtain a bachelor’s degree in a field related to psychology or social work first before obtaining a more common master’s degree in the field of therapy with addiction as the focal point. If one would want to advance further, they could go to school for a doctorate degree in addiction counseling or a degree related to addiction medicine. One might do this if they wanted to dive into the depths of addiction medicine as a subspecialty and learn all of what there is to know about the topic, which might include a career as a professor in addiction studies or a job in an administrative position at a rehabilitation center. A more hands-on approach that one could take to gain more experience in the field of addiction medicine include clinical hours, internships, or entry-level positions where one can gain a better understanding of the field. In October of 2015, the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) officially recognized addiction medicine as a subspecialty. In several countries around the world, specialist bodies have been set up to ensure high quality practice in addiction medicine. For example, within the United States, there are two accepted specialty examinations. One is a Board Certification in Addiction Psychiatry from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. The other is a Board Certification in Addiction Medicine from the American Board of Preventive Medicine. The latter approach is available to all physicians with primary Board certification, while the former is available only to board-certified psychiatrists. Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine may also seek board certification via the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). The Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine must have a primary board certification in Neurology & Psychiatry, Internal Medicine, or Family Practice from the American Osteopathic Association and complete an AOA approved addiction medicine fellowship. Successful completion of a board examination administered via the AOA will grant a certificate of added qualification (CAQ) in addiction medicine. Within Australia, addiction medicine specialists are certified via the Chapter of Addiction Medicine, which is part of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. They may alternatively be a member of the Section of Addiction Psychiatry, Royal Australian & New Zealand College of Psychiatrists. The International Society of Addiction Medicine also can provide certification of expertise.",Wiki
Addiction_psychiatry,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction_psychiatry,"Addiction psychiatry is a medical subspecialty within psychiatry that focuses on the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of people who have one or more disorders related to addiction. This may include disorders involving legal and illegal drugs, gambling, sex, food, and other impulse control disorders. Addiction psychiatrists are substance use disorder experts. Growing amounts of scientific knowledge, such as the health effects and treatments for substance use disorders, have led to advancements in the field of addiction psychiatry. These advancements in understanding the neurobiology of rewarding behavior, along with federal funding, has allowed for ample opportunity for research in the discipline of addiction psychiatry. Addiction psychiatry is an expanding field, and currently there is a high demand for substance use disorder experts in both the private and public sector. Addiction psychiatry is a relatively new subspecialty of psychiatry. As of October 1991, the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), with support of the American Psychiatric Association, established a ""Committee on Certification of Added Qualifications in Addiction Psychiatry."" This was a way to identify the most educated and experienced psychiatrists in the profession; however, it was not until 1993 when ""Addiction Psychiatry"" was granted sub-specialization status. Years later, in 1997 the committee's board of trustees along with the ABMS renamed the committee ""Committee on Certification in the Subspecialty of Addiction Psychiatry"". The committee became more geared toward developing the subspecialty of addiction psychiatry. As of 1997, there were only 13 addiction psychiatry programs that the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) recognized. Currently the ACGME recognizes 45 different residency programs in the United States. In order to become a certified addiction psychiatrist, one must first have completed medical school and further be certified as a general psychiatrist by the ABPN. Next, general psychiatrists must commit themselves to an ACGME-accredited residency in addiction psychiatry. The addiction psychiatry residencies are one-year programs set in a hospital or clinical setting where general psychiatrists learn how to diagnose and treat substance-use disorders as well as potential coexisting psychiatric disorders. After completing one of these residency programs addiction psychiatrists are then capable of being hired in either a private or public setting. An increase in pressure from local and federal governments to provide for patients suffering from addiction has resulted in the increased demand for addiction psychiatrists. Federal funding for the prevention of addiction has been carried out via block grants. These investments in addiction treatment yield savings in overall societal costs, as general health care costs diminish. As of June 2018, the average reported salary of addiction psychiatrists was $250,000. Additionally, 47 addiction psychiatrist appeared on U.S. News & World Report's list of U.S. News Top Doctors. A further 16 addiction psychiatrists were nominated by their peers to an even more selective group of America's Top Doctors. Addiction psychiatry aims to treat individuals with addiction issues along with co-occurring psychiatric disorders, otherwise known as patients with dual diagnosis. Addiction psychiatrists treat a wide variety of patients of all ages with varying conditions. Each case of addiction is unique and addiction psychiatrists must cater to each individual patient. Addiction psychiatrists must recognize the numerous factors that tie into each individual's struggle with an addiction. For example, substance use often occurs among individuals dealing with mood disorders and other social stresses. Addiction psychiatrists must be able to recognize, diagnose, and treat the disorders concurrent with the substance use issues. Furthermore, addiction psychiatrists must also recognize certain health effects from illicit drugs in order to properly treat each individual. Addiction psychiatry encompasses both medicine and psychotherapy, or professional therapeutic interaction, as the means of treating individuals. In a conventional addiction psychiatry session, addiction psychiatrists will gain a better understanding of their patient's lifestyle by gathering medical history and the patient's mental health concerns. Next, the psychiatrist will identify individualized solutions to the patient's problem; this may include medicines and/or psychotherapy. Addiction psychiatrists are uniquely equipped to handle co-occurring mental health diagnoses and substance use disorders (whether in the context of active use, withdrawal or early/late recovery). While there are many FDA-approved medications for substance use disorder treatment, addiction psychiatrists can attune to the most appropriate medication for their specific patient. Acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone are the most common medications used to treat alcohol use disorder. Buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone are the most common medications used to treat OUD. Moreover, addiction psychiatrists recommend the benefits of 12-Step programs such as Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous and often encourage patients to seek external support. Addiction psychiatry can also be a method of recovery for those who have been unable to manage their substance use disorder without prior success.",Wiki
Adenosine_triphosphate,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleoside triphosphate that provides energy to drive and support many processes in living cells, such as muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, and chemical synthesis. Found in all known forms of life, it is often referred to as the ""molecular unit of currency"" for intracellular energy transfer. When consumed in a metabolic process, ATP converts either to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Other processes regenerate ATP. It is also a precursor to DNA and RNA, and is used as a coenzyme. An average adult human processes around 50 kilograms (about 100 moles) daily. From the perspective of biochemistry, ATP is classified as a nucleoside triphosphate, which indicates that it consists of three components: a nitrogenous base (adenine), the sugar ribose, and the triphosphate. ATP consists of an adenine attached by the #9-nitrogen atom to the 1′ carbon atom of a sugar (ribose), which in turn is attached at the 5' carbon atom of the sugar to a triphosphate group. In its many reactions related to metabolism, the adenine and sugar groups remain unchanged, but the triphosphate is converted to di- and monophosphate, giving respectively the derivatives ADP and AMP. The three phosphoryl groups are labeled as alpha (α), beta (β), and, for the terminal phosphate, gamma (γ). In neutral solution, ionized ATP exists mostly as ATP4−, with a small proportion of ATP3−. Polyanionic and featuring a potentially chelating polyphosphate group, ATP binds metal cations with high affinity. The binding constant for Mg2+ is (9554). The binding of a divalent cation, almost always magnesium, strongly affects the interaction of ATP with various proteins. Due to the strength of the ATP-Mg2+ interaction, ATP exists in the cell mostly as a complex with Mg2+ bonded to the phosphate oxygen centers. A second magnesium ion is critical for ATP binding in the kinase domain. The presence of Mg2+ regulates kinase activity. It is interesting from an RNA world perspective that ATP can carry a Mg ion which catalyzes RNA polymerization.[citation needed] Salts of ATP can be isolated as colorless solids. ATP is stable in aqueous solutions between pH 6.8 and 7.4 (in the absence of catalysts). At more extreme pH levels, it rapidly hydrolyses to ADP and phosphate. Living cells maintain the ratio of ATP to ADP at a point ten orders of magnitude from equilibrium, with ATP concentrations fivefold higher than the concentration of ADP. In the context of biochemical reactions, the P-O-P bonds are frequently referred to as high-energy bonds. The hydrolysis of ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate releases 20.5 kilojoules per mole (4.9 kcal/mol) of enthalpy. This may differ under physiological conditions if the reactant and products are not exactly in these ionization states. The values of the free energy released by cleaving either a phosphate (Pi) or a pyrophosphate (PPi) unit from ATP at standard state concentrations of 1 mol/L at pH 7 are: These abbreviated equations at a pH near 7 can be written more explicitly (R = adenosyl): At cytoplasmic conditions, where the ADP/ATP ratio is 10 orders of magnitude from equilibrium, the ΔG is around −57 kJ/mol. Along with pH, the free energy change of ATP hydrolysis is also associated with Mg2+ concentration, from ΔG°' = −35.7 kJ/mol at a Mg2+ concentration of zero, to ΔG°' = −31 kJ/mol at [Mg2+] = 5 mM. Higher concentrations of Mg2+ decrease free energy released in the reaction due to binding of Mg2+ ions to negatively charged oxygen atoms of ATP at pH 7. A typical intracellular concentration of ATP may be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism. ATP can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes; the three main pathways in eukaryotes are (1) glycolysis, (2) the citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation, and (3) beta-oxidation. The overall process of oxidizing glucose to carbon dioxide, the combination of pathways 1 and 2, known as cellular respiration, produces about 30 equivalents of ATP from each molecule of glucose. ATP production by a non-photosynthetic aerobic eukaryote occurs mainly in the mitochondria, which comprise nearly 25% of the volume of a typical cell. In glycolysis, glucose and glycerol are metabolized to pyruvate. Glycolysis generates two equivalents of ATP through substrate phosphorylation catalyzed by two enzymes, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and pyruvate kinase. Two equivalents of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) are also produced, which can be oxidized via the electron transport chain and result in the generation of additional ATP by ATP synthase. The pyruvate generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the Krebs Cycle. Glycolysis is viewed as consisting of two phases with five steps each. In phase 1, ""the preparatory phase"", glucose is converted to 2 d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (g3p). One ATP is invested in Step 1, and another ATP is invested in Step 3. Steps 1 and 3 of glycolysis are referred to as ""Priming Steps"". In Phase 2, two equivalents of g3p are converted to two pyruvates. In Step 7, two ATP are produced. Also, in Step 10, two further equivalents of ATP are produced. In Steps 7 and 10, ATP is generated from ADP. A net of two ATPs is formed in the glycolysis cycle. The glycolysis pathway is later associated with the Citric Acid Cycle which produces additional equivalents of ATP.[citation needed] In glycolysis, hexokinase is directly inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two binding sites for ATP – the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly. A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including cyclic AMP, ammonium ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate. In the mitochondrion, pyruvate is oxidized by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to the acetyl group, which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every ""turn"" of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP guanosine triphosphate (GTP) through substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase, as succinyl-CoA is converted to succinate, three equivalents of NADH, and one equivalent of FADH2. NADH and FADH2 are recycled (to NAD+ and FAD, respectively) by oxidative phosphorylation, generating additional ATP. The oxidation of NADH results in the synthesis of 2–3 equivalents of ATP, and the oxidation of one FADH2 yields between 1–2 equivalents of ATP. The majority of cellular ATP is generated by this process. Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular oxygen, it is an obligately aerobic process because O2 is used to recycle the NADH and FADH2. In the absence of oxygen, the citric acid cycle ceases. The generation of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH relies on the malate-aspartate shuttle (and to a lesser extent, the glycerol-phosphate shuttle) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts oxaloacetate to malate, which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD+. A transaminase converts the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space. In oxidative phosphorylation, the passage of electrons from NADH and FADH2 through the electron transport chain releases the energy to pump protons out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space. This pumping generates a proton motive force that is the net effect of a pH gradient and an electric potential gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Flow of protons down this potential gradient – that is, from the intermembrane space to the matrix – yields ATP by ATP synthase. Three ATP are produced per turn. Although oxygen consumption appears fundamental for the maintenance of the proton motive force, in the event of oxygen shortage (hypoxia), intracellular acidosis (mediated by enhanced glycolytic rates and ATP hydrolysis), contributes to mitochondrial membrane potential and directly drives ATP synthesis. Most of the ATP synthesized in the mitochondria will be used for cellular processes in the cytosol; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. ATP outward movement is favored by the membrane's electrochemical potential because the cytosol has a relatively positive charge compared to the relatively negative matrix. For every ATP transported out, it costs 1 H+. Producing one ATP costs about 3 H+. Therefore, making and exporting one ATP requires 4H+. The inner membrane contains an antiporter, the ADP/ATP translocase, which is an integral membrane protein used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for ADP in the intermembrane space. The citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates, particularly the ratio of NAD+ to NADH and the concentrations of calcium, inorganic phosphate, ATP, ADP, and AMP. Citrate – the ion that gives its name to the cycle – is a feedback inhibitor of citrate synthase and also inhibits PFK, providing a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis. In the presence of air and various cofactors and enzymes, fatty acids are converted to acetyl-CoA. The pathway is called beta-oxidation. Each cycle of beta-oxidation shortens the fatty acid chain by two carbon atoms and produces one equivalent each of acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH2. The acetyl-CoA is metabolized by the citric acid cycle to generate ATP, while the NADH and FADH2 are used by oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. Dozens of ATP equivalents are generated by the beta-oxidation of a single long acyl chain. In oxidative phosphorylation, the key control point is the reaction catalyzed by cytochrome c oxidase, which is regulated by the availability of its substrate – the reduced form of cytochrome c. The amount of reduced cytochrome c available is directly related to the amounts of other substrates: which directly implies this equation: Thus, a high ratio of [NADH] to [NAD+] or a high ratio of [ADP] [Pi] to [ATP] imply a high amount of reduced cytochrome c and a high level of cytochrome c oxidase activity. An additional level of regulation is introduced by the transport rates of ATP and NADH between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm. Ketone bodies can be used as fuels, yielding 22 ATP and 2 GTP molecules per acetoacetate molecule when oxidized in the mitochondria. Ketone bodies are transported from the liver to other tissues, where acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate can be reconverted to acetyl-CoA to produce reducing equivalents (NADH and FADH2), via the citric acid cycle. Ketone bodies cannot be used as fuel by the liver, because the liver lacks the enzyme β-ketoacyl-CoA transferase, also called thiolase. Acetoacetate in low concentrations is taken up by the liver and undergoes detoxification through the methylglyoxal pathway which ends with lactate. Acetoacetate in high concentrations is absorbed by cells other than those in the liver and enters a different pathway via 1,2-propanediol. Though the pathway follows a different series of steps requiring ATP, 1,2-propanediol can be turned into pyruvate. Fermentation is the metabolism of organic compounds in the absence of air. It involves substrate-level phosphorylation in the absence of a respiratory electron transport chain. The equation for the reaction of glucose to form lactic acid is: Anaerobic respiration is respiration in the absence of O2. Prokaryotes can utilize a variety of electron acceptors. These include nitrate, sulfate, and carbon dioxide. ATP can also be synthesized through several so-called ""replenishment"" reactions catalyzed by the enzyme families of nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDKs), which use other nucleoside triphosphates as a high-energy phosphate donor, and the ATP:guanido-phosphotransferase family.[citation needed] In plants, ATP is synthesized in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast. The process is called photophosphorylation. The ""machinery"" is similar to that in mitochondria except that light energy is used to pump protons across a membrane to produce a proton-motive force. ATP synthase then ensues exactly as in oxidative phosphorylation. Some of the ATP produced in the chloroplasts is consumed in the Calvin cycle, which produces triose sugars. The total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0.1 mol/L. The majority of ATP is recycled from ADP by the aforementioned processes. Thus, at any given time, the total amount of ATP + ADP remains fairly constant. The energy used by human cells in an adult requires the hydrolysis of 100 to 150 mol/L of ATP daily, which means a human will typically use their body weight worth of ATP over the course of the day. Each equivalent of ATP is recycled 1000–1500 times during a single day (150 / 0.1 = 1500), at approximately 9×1020 molecules/s. ATP is involved in signal transduction by serving as substrate for kinases, enzymes that transfer phosphate groups. Kinases are the most common ATP-binding proteins. They share a small number of common folds. Phosphorylation of a protein by a kinase can activate a cascade such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. ATP is also a substrate of adenylate cyclase, most commonly in G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction pathways and is transformed to second messenger, cyclic AMP, which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores. This form of signal transduction is particularly important in brain function, although it is involved in the regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes. ATP is one of four monomers required in the synthesis of RNA. The process is promoted by RNA polymerases. A similar process occurs in the formation of DNA, except that ATP is first converted to the deoxyribonucleotide dATP. Like many condensation reactions in nature, DNA replication and DNA transcription also consume ATP. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes consume ATP in the attachment tRNA to amino acids, forming aminoacyl-tRNA complexes. Aminoacyl transferase binds AMP-amino acid to tRNA. The coupling reaction proceeds in two steps: The amino acid is coupled to the penultimate nucleotide at the 3′-end of the tRNA (the A in the sequence CCA) via an ester bond (roll over in illustration). Transporting chemicals out of a cell against a gradient is often associated with ATP hydrolysis. Transport is mediated by ATP binding cassette transporters. The human genome encodes 48 ABC transporters, that are used for exporting drugs, lipids, and other compounds. Cells secrete ATP to communicate with other cells in a process called purinergic signalling. ATP serves as a neurotransmitter in many parts of the nervous system, modulates ciliary beating, affects vascular oxygen supply etc. ATP is either secreted directly across the cell membrane through channel proteins or is pumped into vesicles which then fuse with the membrane. Cells detect ATP using the purinergic receptor proteins P2X and P2Y. ATP has been shown to be a critically important signalling molecule for microglia - neuron interactions in the adult brain, as well as during brain development. Furthermore, tissue-injury induced ATP-signalling is a major factor in rapid microglial phenotype changes. ATP fuels muscle contractions. Muscle contractions are regulated by signaling pathways, although different muscle types being regulated by specific pathways and stimuli based on their particular function. However, in all muscle types, contraction is performed by the proteins actin and myosin. ATP is initially bound to myosin. When ATPase hydrolyzes the bound ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate, myosin is positioned in a way that it can bind to actin. Myosin bound by ADP and Pi forms cross-bridges with actin and the subsequent release of ADP and Pi releases energy as the power stroke. The power stroke causes actin filament to slide past the myosin filament, shortening the muscle and causing a contraction. Another ATP molecule can then bind to myosin, releasing it from actin and allowing this process to repeat. ATP has recently been proposed to act as a biological hydrotrope and has been shown to affect proteome-wide solubility. Acetyl phosphate (AcP), a precursor to ATP, can readily be synthesized at modest yields from thioacetate in pH 7 and 20 °C and pH 8 and 50 °C, although acetyl phosphate is less stable in warmer temperatures and alkaline conditions than in cooler and acidic to neutral conditions. It is unable to promote polymerization of ribonucleotides and amino acids and was only capable of phosphorylation of organic compounds. It was shown that it can promote aggregation and stabilization of AMP in the presence of Na+, aggregation of nucleotides could promote polymerization above 75 °C in the absence of Na+. It is possible that polymerization promoted by AcP could occur at mineral surfaces. It was shown that ADP can only be phosphorylated to ATP by AcP and other nucleoside triphosphates were not phosphorylated by AcP. This might explain why all lifeforms use ATP to drive biochemical reactions. Biochemistry laboratories often use in vitro studies to explore ATP-dependent molecular processes. ATP analogs are also used in X-ray crystallography to determine a protein structure in complex with ATP, often together with other substrates.[citation needed] Enzyme inhibitors of ATP-dependent enzymes such as kinases are needed to examine the binding sites and transition states involved in ATP-dependent reactions.[citation needed] Most useful ATP analogs cannot be hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead, they trap the enzyme in a structure closely related to the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a sulfur atom; this anion is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound vanadate ion. Caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration. ATP is used intravenously for some heart-related conditions. ATP was discovered in 1929 by Karl Lohmann [de] and Jendrassik and, independently, by Cyrus Fiske and Yellapragada Subba Rao of Harvard Medical School, both teams competing against each other to find an assay for phosphorus. It was proposed to be the intermediary between energy-yielding and energy-requiring reactions in cells by Fritz Albert Lipmann in 1941. It was first synthesized in the laboratory by Alexander Todd in 1948, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1957 partly for this work. The 1978 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Peter Dennis Mitchell for the discovery of the chemiosmotic mechanism of ATP synthesis. The 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was divided, one half jointly to Paul D. Boyer and John E. Walker ""for their elucidation of the enzymatic mechanism underlying the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)"" and the other half to Jens C. Skou ""for the first discovery of an ion-transporting enzyme, Na+, K+ -ATPase.""",Wiki
Adolescent_medicine,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescent_medicine,"Adolescent medicine, also known as adolescent and young adult medicine, is a medical subspecialty that focuses on care of patients who are in the adolescent period of development. This period begins at puberty and lasts until growth has stopped, at which time adulthood begins. Typically, patients in this age range will be in the last years of middle school up until college graduation (some doctors in this subspecialty treat young adults attending college at area clinics, in the subfield of college health). In developed nations, the psychosocial period of adolescence is extended both by an earlier start, as the onset of puberty begins earlier, and a later end, as patients require more years of education or training before they reach economic independence from their parents. Medicine is often categorized most simply as pediatric and adult, with the pediatric category covering from infancy through both childhood and adolescence. However, such categorization is further divided in some contexts, such that adolescent medicine can be a more specific focus within pediatrics and geriatrics can be a more specific focus within adult medicine. Issues with a high prevalence during adolescence are frequently addressed by providers. These include: Adolescents who are gay, lesbian or bisexual tend to demonstrate more risky health behaviors and have worse health outcomes compared to heterosexual youth, including: Chronic conditions often cause delay in onset of puberty and temporary or permanent impediments to growth; conversely the growth and hormonal changes can destabilize treatment for the chronic condition. An increase in independence can lead to gaps in self-management, for example, in the decreased management of diabetes. In addition, issues of medical ethics, particularly related to confidentiality and the right to consent for medical care, are pertinent to the practice of adolescent medicine. Marginalised young people’s access is affected by their ability to recognize and understand health issues; service knowledge and attitudes toward help seeking; structural barriers; professionals' knowledge, skills, attitudes; service environments and structures; ability to navigate the health system; youth participation; and technology opportunities. Marginalised young people’s healthcare journeys can be supported by advocates that help them navigate the health system. The particular needs of young people when accessing healthcare have also led the WHO to publishing guidelines for adolescent-friendly health care, in an effort to increase adolescents utilization of the healthcare system. Adolescent medicine providers are generally drawn from the specialties of pediatrics, internal medicine, med/peds or family medicine. The certifying boards for these different specialties have varying requirements for certification, though all require successful completion of a fellowship and a passing score on a certifying exam. The American Board of Pediatrics and the American Board of Internal Medicine require evidence of scholarly achievement by candidates for subspecialty certification, usually in the form of an original research study. In the United States, subspecialty medical board certification in adolescent medicine is available through the specialty boards of American Board of Internal Medicine, the American Osteopathic Board of Neurology and Psychiatry, the American Board of Family Medicine, the American Osteopathic Board of Family Physicians, the American Board of Pediatrics, and the American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics.

Aerobiology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobiology,"Aerobiology (from Greek ἀήρ, aēr, ""air""; βίος, bios, ""life""; and -λογία, -logia) is a branch of biology that studies the passive transport of organic particles, such as bacteria, fungal spores, very small insects, pollen grains and viruses. Aerobiologists have traditionally been involved in the measurement and reporting of airborne pollen and fungal spores as a service to those with allergies. However, aerobiology is a varied field, relating to environmental science, plant science, meteorology, phenology, and climate change. The first mention of ""aerobiology"" was made by Fred Campbell Meier in the 1930s. The particles, which can be described as Aeroplankton, generally range in size from nanometers to micrometers which makes them challenging to detect. Aerosolization is the process of a small and light particles becoming suspended in moving air. Now bioaerosols, these pollen and fungal spores can be transported across an ocean, or even travel around the globe. Due to the high quantities of microbes and the ease of dispersion, Martinus Beijerinck once said ""Everything is everywhere, the environment selects"". This means that aeroplankton are everywhere and have been everywhere, and it solely depends on environmental factors to determine which remain. Aeroplankton are found in significant quantities even in the Atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The effects on climate and cloud chemistry of these atmospheric populations is still under review. NASA and other research agencies are studying how long these bioaerosols can remain afloat and how they can survive in such extreme climates. The conditions of the upper atmosphere are similar to the climate on Mars' surface, and the microbes found are helping redefine the conditions which can support life. The process of dispersal of aerobiological particles has 3 steps: removal from source, dispersion through air, and deposition to rest. The particle geometry and environment affect all three phases, however once it is aerosolized, its fate depends on the laws of physics governing the motion of the air. Pollen and spores can be blown from their surface or shaken loose. Generally the wind speed required for release is higher than average wind speed. Rain splatter can also dislodge spores. Some fungi can even be triggered by environmental factors to actively eject spores. Once released from rest, the aeroplankton is at the mercy of the wind and physics. The settling speed of spores and pollen vary and is a major factor in dispersion; the longer the particle is floating, the longer it can be caught by a turbulent wind gust. Wind speed and direction fluctuate with time and height, so the specific path of once neighboring particles can vary significantly. The concentration of particles in the air decreases with distance from source, and the dispersion distance is most accurately modeled as a power function. Deposition is a combination of gravity and inertia. The fall speed for small particles can be calculated by mass and geometry, but the complex shapes of pollen and spores often fall slower than their estimated speed modeled with simple shapes. Spores can also be removed from the air from impact; the inertia of the particles will cause them to hit surfaces along their path, instead of flowing around them like air. There have been many studies performed to understand real-life dispersal patterns of pollen and spores. To collect samples, studies often use a volumetric spore trap such as a Hirst-type sampler. Particles stick to a sampling strip and then can be inspected under a microscope. Scientists have to count the particles under magnification, and then analyze sample DNA by Amplicon sequence variant (ASV) or another common method. A challenge repeatedly cited in literature is that because of differing testing or analysis methodologies, results are not always comparable across studies. Therefore, extensive data collection must be performed in each study to get an accurate model. Unfortunately there is no database of aerobiological particle distribution to compare results to. Allergic rhinitis is a type of inflammation in the nose that occurs when the immune system overreacts to allergens in the air. It is typically triggered in humans by pollen and other bioaerosols. Between 10% and 30% of people in Western countries are affected. Symptoms are usually worse during pollination periods, when there is significantly more pollen aerosolized in the air. In these peak periods, staying indoors is one way to limit exposure. However, studies have shown that there are still significant levels of pollen indoors. In the winter, pollen levels indoors actually exceed outdoor levels. Up to date data on pollen levels is critical for humans that have allergies. A current limitation is that many spore traps require scientists to identify and count individual pollen grains under magnification. This causes data to be delayed, sometimes by over a week. There are currently a number of fully automatic spore traps in development, and once they are fully functional they will improve the lives of people with allergies. Scientists have predicted that the meteorological results of climate change will weaken pollen and spore dispersal barriers, and lead to less biological uniqueness in different regions. Precipitation increases richness (number of species) of biodiversity in regions because clouds formulate in the upper atmosphere where there is more varied biodiversity. Specifically in the Arctic, climate change has dramatically increased precipitation, and scientists have seen new microbes in the area because of it. Rising summer temperatures and CO2 levels have shown to increase total amounts of pollen released by certain trees, as well as delay the start of pollen season. However, more studies are needed to see long term effects of climate change.",Wiki
Age_of_Enlightenment,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment,"The Age of Enlightenment (also the Age of Reason and the Enlightenment) was an intellectual and philosophical movement taking place in Europe from the late 17th century to the early 19th century. The Enlightenment, which valued knowledge gained through rationalism and empiricism, was concerned with a range of social ideas and political ideals such as natural law, liberty, and progress, toleration and fraternity, constitutional government, and the formal separation of church and state. The Enlightenment was preceded by and overlapped the Scientific Revolution, which included the work of Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, Francis Bacon, Pierre Gassendi, Christiaan Huygens and Isaac Newton, among others, as well as the rationalist philosophy of Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, Leibniz, and John Locke. The dating of the period of the beginning of the Enlightenment can be attributed to the publication of René Descartes' Discourse on the Method in 1637, with his method of systematically disbelieving everything unless there was a well-founded reason for accepting it, and featuring his famous dictum, Cogito, ergo sum (""I think, therefore I am""). Others cite the publication of Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica (1687) as the culmination of the Scientific Revolution and the beginning of the Enlightenment. European historians traditionally dated its beginning with the death of Louis XIV of France in 1715 and its end with the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. Many historians now date the end of the Enlightenment as the start of the 19th century, with the latest proposed year being the death of Immanuel Kant in 1804. Philosophers and scientists of the period widely circulated their ideas through meetings at scientific academies, Masonic lodges, literary salons, coffeehouses and in printed books, journals, and pamphlets. The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and religious officials and paved the way for the political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. A variety of 19th-century movements, including liberalism, socialism, and neoclassicism, trace their intellectual heritage to the Enlightenment. Scientific racism also has a background in this period. The Enlightenment was marked by an increasing awareness of the relationship between the mind and the everyday media of the world, and by an emphasis on the scientific method and reductionism, along with increased questioning of religious dogma — an attitude captured by Kant's essay Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?, where the phrase sapere aude ('dare to know') can be found. The central doctrines of the Enlightenment were individual liberty, representative government, the rule of law, and religious freedom, in contrast to an absolute monarchy or single party state and the religious persecution of faiths other than those formally established and often controlled outright by the State. By contrast, other intellectual currents included arguments in favour of anti-Christianity, Deism, and even Atheism, accompanied by demands for secular states, bans on religious education, suppression of monasteries, the suppression of the Jesuits, and the expulsion of religious orders. Contemporary criticism, particularly of these anti-religious concepts, has since been dubbed the Counter-Enlightenment by Sir Isaiah Berlin. The Age of Enlightenment was preceded by and closely associated with the Scientific Revolution. Earlier philosophers whose work influenced the Enlightenment included Francis Bacon, Pierre Gassendi, René Descartes, Thomas Hobbes, Baruch Spinoza, John Locke, Pierre Bayle, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Some of figures of the Enlightenment included Cesare Beccaria, George Berkeley, Denis Diderot, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Lord Monboddo, Montesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Adam Smith, Hugo Grotius, and Voltaire. One of the most influential Enlightenment publications was the Encyclopédie (Encyclopedia). Published between 1751 and 1772 in 35 volumes, it was compiled by Diderot, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, and a team of 150 others. The Encyclopédie helped spread the ideas of the Enlightenment across Europe and beyond. Other publications of the Enlightenment included Berkeley's A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710), Voltaire's Letters on the English (1733) and Philosophical Dictionary (1764); Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature (1740); Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws (1748); Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality (1754) and The Social Contract (1762); Cesare Beccaria's On Crimes and Punishments (1764); Adam Smith's The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and The Wealth of Nations (1776); and Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781).[citation needed] Bacon's empiricism and Descartes' rationalist philosophy laid the foundation for enlightenment thinking. Descartes' attempt to construct the sciences on a secure metaphysical foundation was not as successful as his method of doubt applied to philosophy, which led to a dualistic doctrine of mind and matter. His skepticism was refined by Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690) and Hume's writings in the 1740s. Descartes' dualism was challenged by Spinoza's uncompromising assertion of the unity of matter in his Tractatus (1670) and Ethics (1677). According to Jonathan Israel, these laid down two distinct lines of Enlightenment thought: first, the moderate variety, following Descartes, Locke, and Christian Wolff, which sought accommodation between reform and the traditional systems of power and faith, and, second, the Radical Enlightenment, inspired by the philosophy of Spinoza, advocating democracy, individual liberty, freedom of expression, and eradication of religious authority. The moderate variety tended to be deistic whereas the radical tendency separated the basis of morality entirely from theology. Both lines of thought were eventually opposed by a conservative Counter-Enlightenment which sought a return to faith. In the mid-18th century, Paris became the center of philosophic and scientific activity challenging traditional doctrines and dogmas. After the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685, the relationship between church and the absolutist government was very strong. The early enlightenment emerged in protest to these circumstances, gaining ground under the support of Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV. Called the Siècle des Lumières, the philosophical movement of the Enlightenment had already started by the early 18th century, when Pierre Bayle launched the popular and scholarly Enlightenment critique of religion. As a skeptic Bayle only partially accepted the philosophy and principles of rationality. He did draw a strict boundary between morality and religion. The rigor of his Dictionnaire Historique et Critique influenced many of the Enlightenment Encyclopédistes. By the mid-18th century the French Enlightenment had found a focus in the project of the Encyclopédie. The philosophical movement was led by Voltaire and Rousseau, who argued for a society based upon reason rather than faith and Catholic doctrine, for a new civil order based on natural law, and for science based on experiments and observation. The political philosopher Montesquieu introduced the idea of a separation of powers in a government, a concept which was enthusiastically adopted by the authors of the United States Constitution. While the philosophes of the French Enlightenment were not revolutionaries and many were members of the nobility, their ideas played an important part in undermining the legitimacy of the Old Regime and shaping the French Revolution. Francis Hutcheson, a moral philosopher and founding figure of the Scottish Enlightenment, described the utilitarian and consequentialist principle that virtue is that which provides, in his words, ""the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers."" Much of what is incorporated in the scientific method (the nature of knowledge, evidence, experience, and causation) and some modern attitudes towards the relationship between science and religion were developed by Hutcheson's protégés in Edinburgh: David Hume and Adam Smith. Hume became a major figure in the skeptical philosophical and empiricist traditions of philosophy. Kant tried to reconcile rationalism and religious belief, individual freedom and political authority, as well as map out a view of the public sphere through private and public reason. Kant's work continued to shape German thought and indeed all of European philosophy, well into the 20th century. Mary Wollstonecraft was one of England's earliest feminist philosophers. She argued for a society based on reason and that women as well as men should be treated as rational beings. She is best known for her work A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792). Science played an important role in Enlightenment discourse and thought. Many Enlightenment writers and thinkers had backgrounds in the sciences and associated scientific advancement with the overthrow of religion and traditional authority in favour of the development of free speech and thought. There were immediate practical results. The experiments of Antoine Lavoisier were used to create the first modern chemical plants in Paris, and the experiments of the Montgolfier brothers enabled them to launch the first manned flight in a hot air balloon in 1783. Broadly speaking, Enlightenment science greatly valued empiricism and rational thought and was embedded with the Enlightenment ideal of advancement and progress. The study of science, under the heading of natural philosophy, was divided into physics and a conglomerate grouping of chemistry and natural history, which included anatomy, biology, geology, mineralogy, and zoology. As with most Enlightenment views, the benefits of science were not seen universally: Rousseau criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier. Science during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies and academies, which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge, in contrast to the scholasticism of the university. Some societies created or retained links to universities, but contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members and the administration of the society. In the 18th century, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over 70 official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term ""the Age of Academies"" to describe the 18th century. Another important development was the popularization of science among an increasingly literate population. Philosophes introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the Encyclopédie and the popularization of Newtonianism by Voltaire and Émilie du Châtelet. Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the history of science. The century saw significant advancements in the practice of medicine, mathematics, and physics; the development of biological taxonomy; a new understanding of magnetism and electricity; and the maturation of chemistry as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry.[citation needed] The influence of science began appearing more commonly in poetry and literature. Some poetry became infused with scientific metaphor and imagery, while other poems were written directly about scientific topics. Richard Blackmore committed the Newtonian system to verse in Creation, a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books (1712). After Newton's death in 1727, poems were composed in his honour for decades. James Thomson penned his ""Poem to the Memory of Newton,"" which mourned the loss of Newton and praised his science and legacy. Hume and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed a ""science of man,"" which was expressed historically in works by authors including James Burnett, Adam Ferguson, John Millar, and William Robertson, all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behaved in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of modernity. Modern sociology largely originated from this movement, and Hume's philosophical concepts that directly influenced James Madison (and thus the U.S. Constitution), and as popularised by Dugald Stewart was the basis of classical liberalism. In 1776, Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations, often considered the first work on modern economics as it had an immediate impact on British economic policy that continues into the 21st century. It was immediately preceded and influenced by Anne Robert Jacques Turgot's drafts of Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth (1766). Smith acknowledged indebtedness and possibly was the original English translator. Beccaria, a jurist, criminologist, philosopher, and politician and one of the great Enlightenment writers, became famous for his masterpiece Dei delitti e delle pene (Of Crimes and Punishments, 1764). His treatise, translated into 22 languages, condemned torture and the death penalty and was a founding work in the field of penology and the classical school of criminology by promoting criminal justice. Francesco Mario Pagano wrote important studies such as Saggi politici (Political Essays, 1783); and Considerazioni sul processo criminale (Considerations on the Criminal Trial, 1787), which established him as an international authority on criminal law. The Enlightenment has long been seen as the foundation of modern Western political and intellectual culture. The Enlightenment brought political modernization to the West, in terms of introducing democratic values and institutions and the creation of modern, liberal democracies. This thesis has been widely accepted by scholars and has been reinforced by the large-scale studies by Robert Darnton, Roy Porter, and, most recently, by Jonathan Israel. Enlightenment thought was deeply influential in the political realm. European rulers such as Catherine II of Russia, Joseph II of Austria, and Frederick II of Prussia tried to apply Enlightenment thought on religious and political tolerance, which became known as enlightened absolutism. Many of the major political and intellectual figures behind the American Revolution associated themselves closely with the Enlightenment: Benjamin Franklin visited Europe repeatedly and contributed actively to the scientific and political debates there and brought the newest ideas back to Philadelphia; Thomas Jefferson closely followed European ideas and later incorporated some of the ideals of the Enlightenment into the Declaration of Independence; and Madison incorporated these ideals into the U.S. Constitution during its framing in 1787. Locke, one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers, based his governance philosophy in social contract theory, a subject that permeated Enlightenment political thought. English philosopher Thomas Hobbes ushered in this new debate with his work Leviathan in 1651. Hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of European liberal thought: the right of the individual, the natural equality of all men, the artificial character of the political order (which led to the later distinction between civil society and the state), the view that all legitimate political power must be ""representative"" and based on the consent of the people, and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid. Both Locke and Rousseau developed social contract theories in Two Treatises of Government and Discourse on Inequality, respectively. While quite different works, Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau agreed that a social contract, in which the government's authority lies in the consent of the governed, is necessary for man to live in civil society. Locke defines the state of nature as a condition in which humans are rational and follow natural law, in which all men are born equal and with the right to life, liberty, and property. However, when one citizen breaks the law of nature both the transgressor and the victim enter into a state of war, from which it is virtually impossible to break free. Therefore, Locke said that individuals enter into civil society to protect their natural rights via an ""unbiased judge"" or common authority, such as courts. In contrast, Rousseau's conception relies on the supposition that ""civil man"" is corrupted, while ""natural man"" has no want he cannot fulfill himself. Natural man is only taken out of the state of nature when the inequality associated with private property is established. Rousseau said that people join into civil society via the social contract to achieve unity while preserving individual freedom. This is embodied in the sovereignty of the general will, the moral and collective legislative body constituted by citizens.[citation needed] Locke is known for his statement that individuals have a right to ""Life, Liberty, and Property,"" and his belief that the natural right to property is derived from labor. Tutored by Locke, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury, wrote in 1706: ""There is a mighty Light which spreads its self over the world especially in those two free Nations of England and Holland; on whom the Affairs of Europe now turn."" Locke's theory of natural rights has influenced many political documents, including the U.S. Declaration of Independence and the French National Constituent Assembly's Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Some philosophes argued that the establishment of a contractual basis of rights would lead to the market mechanism and capitalism, the scientific method, religious tolerance, and the organization of states into self-governing republics through democratic means. In this view, the tendency of the philosophes in particular to apply rationality to every problem is considered the essential change. Although much of Enlightenment political thought was dominated by social contract theorists, Hume and Ferguson criticized this camp. Hume's essay Of the Original Contract argues that governments derived from consent are rarely seen and civil government is grounded in a ruler's habitual authority and force. It is precisely because of the ruler's authority over-and-against the subject that the subject tacitly consents, and Hume says that the subjects would ""never imagine that their consent made him sovereign,"" rather the authority did so. Similarly, Ferguson did not believe citizens built the state, rather polities grew out of social development. In his 1767 An Essay on the History of Civil Society, Ferguson uses the four stages of progress, a theory that was popular in Scotland at the time, to explain how humans advance from a hunting and gathering society to a commercial and civil society without agreeing to a social contract. Both Rousseau's and Locke's social contract theories rest on the presupposition of natural rights, which are not a result of law or custom but are things that all men have in pre-political societies and are therefore universal and inalienable. The most famous natural right formulation comes from Locke's Second Treatise, when he introduces the state of nature. For Locke, the law of nature is grounded on mutual security or the idea that one cannot infringe on another's natural rights, as every man is equal and has the same inalienable rights. These natural rights include perfect equality and freedom, as well as the right to preserve life and property. Locke argues against indentured servitude on the basis that enslaving oneself goes against the law of nature because a person cannot surrender their own rights: freedom is absolute, and no one can take it away. Locke argues that one person cannot enslave another because it is morally reprehensible, although he introduces a caveat by saying that enslavement of a lawful captive in time of war would not go against one's natural rights. The leaders of the Enlightenment were not especially democratic, as they more often look to absolute monarchs as the key to imposing reforms designed by the intellectuals. Voltaire despised democracy and said the absolute monarch must be enlightened and must act as dictated by reason and justice—in other words, be a ""philosopher-king."" In several nations, rulers welcomed leaders of the Enlightenment at court and asked them to help design laws and programs to reform the system, typically to build stronger states. These rulers are called ""enlightened despots"" by historians. They included Frederick the Great of Prussia, Catherine the Great of Russia, Leopold II of Tuscany and Joseph II of Austria. Joseph was over-enthusiastic, announcing many reforms that had little support so that revolts broke out and his regime became a comedy of errors, and nearly all his programs were reversed. Senior ministers Pombal in Portugal and Johann Friedrich Struensee in Denmark also governed according to Enlightenment ideals. In Poland, the model constitution of 1791 expressed Enlightenment ideals, but was in effect for only one year before the nation was partitioned among its neighbors. More enduring were the cultural achievements, which created a nationalist spirit in Poland. Frederick the Great, the king of Prussia from 1740 to 1786, saw himself as a leader of the Enlightenment and patronized philosophers and scientists at his court in Berlin. Voltaire, who had been imprisoned and maltreated by the French government, was eager to accept Frederick's invitation to live at his palace. Frederick explained: ""My principal occupation is to combat ignorance and prejudice... to enlighten minds, cultivate morality, and to make people as happy as it suits human nature, and as the means at my disposal permit."" The Enlightenment has been frequently linked to the American Revolution of 1776 and the French Revolution of 1789—both had some intellectual influence from Thomas Jefferson. One view of the political changes that occurred during the Enlightenment is that the ""consent of the governed"" philosophy as delineated by Locke in Two Treatises of Government (1689) represented a paradigm shift from the old governance paradigm under feudalism known as the ""divine right of kings."" In this view, the revolutions were caused by the fact that this governance paradigm shift often could not be resolved peacefully and therefore violent revolution was the result. A governance philosophy where the king was never wrong would be in direct conflict with one whereby citizens by natural law had to consent to the acts and rulings of their government. Alexis de Tocqueville proposed the French Revolution as the inevitable result of the radical opposition created in the 18th century between the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment. These men of letters constituted a sort of ""substitute aristocracy that was both all-powerful and without real power."" This illusory power came from the rise of ""public opinion,"" born when absolutist centralization removed the nobility and the bourgeoisie from the political sphere. The ""literary politics"" that resulted promoted a discourse of equality and was hence in fundamental opposition to the monarchical regime. De Tocqueville ""clearly designates... the cultural effects of transformation in the forms of the exercise of power."" It does not require great art or magnificently trained eloquence, to prove that Christians should tolerate each other. I, however, am going further: I say that we should regard all men as our brothers. What? The Turk my brother? The Chinaman my brother? The Jew? The Siam? Yes, without doubt; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God? Enlightenment era religious commentary was a response to the preceding century of religious conflict in Europe, especially the Thirty Years' War. Theologians of the Enlightenment wanted to reform their faith to its generally non-confrontational roots and to limit the capacity for religious controversy to spill over into politics and warfare while still maintaining a true faith in God. For moderate Christians, this meant a return to simple Scripture. Locke abandoned the corpus of theological commentary in favor of an ""unprejudiced examination"" of the Word of God alone. He determined the essence of Christianity to be a belief in Christ the redeemer and recommended avoiding more detailed debate. Anthony Collins, one of the English freethinkers, published his ""Essay concerning the Use of Reason in Propositions the Evidence whereof depends on Human Testimony"" (1707), in which he rejects the distinction between ""above reason"" and ""contrary to reason,"" and demands that revelation should conform to man's natural ideas of God. In the Jefferson Bible, Thomas Jefferson went further and dropped any passages dealing with miracles, visitations of angels, and the resurrection of Jesus after his death, as he tried to extract the practical Christian moral code of the New Testament. Enlightenment scholars sought to curtail the political power of organized religion and thereby prevent another age of intolerant religious war. Spinoza determined to remove politics from contemporary and historical theology (e.g., disregarding Judaic law). Moses Mendelssohn advised affording no political weight to any organized religion but instead recommended that each person follow what they found most convincing. They believed a good religion based in instinctive morals and a belief in God should not theoretically need force to maintain order in its believers, and both Mendelssohn and Spinoza judged religion on its moral fruits, not the logic of its theology. Several novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including deism and talk of atheism. According to Thomas Paine, deism is the simple belief in God the Creator with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note: ""In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism."" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined; that is, since atheists gave themselves to no supreme authority and no law and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle observed that, in his day, ""prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion],"" and he believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual ""could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions."" The ""Radical Enlightenment"" promoted the concept of separating church and state, an idea that is often credited to Locke. According to his principle of the social contract, Locke said that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he said must therefore remain protected from any government authority. These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with the social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the United States Constitution. In a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in Connecticut, Thomas Jefferson calls for a ""wall of separation between church and state"" at the federal level. He previously had supported successful efforts to disestablish the Church of England in Virginia and authored the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Jefferson's political ideals were greatly influenced by the writings of Locke, Bacon, and Newton, whom he considered the three greatest men that ever lived. The Enlightenment took hold in most European countries and influenced nations globally, often with a specific local emphasis. For example, in France it became associated with anti-government and anti-Church radicalism, while in Germany it reached deep into the middle classes, where it expressed a spiritualistic and nationalistic tone without threatening governments or established churches. Government responses varied widely. In France, the government was hostile, and the philosophes fought against its censorship, sometimes being imprisoned or hounded into exile. The British government, for the most part, ignored the Enlightenment's leaders in England and Scotland, although it did give Newton a knighthood and a very lucrative government office. A common theme among most countries which derived Enlightenment ideas from Europe was the intentional non-inclusion of Enlightenment philosophies pertaining to slavery. Originally during the French Revolution, a revolution deeply inspired by Enlightenment philosophy, ""France's revolutionary government had denounced slavery, but the property-holding 'revolutionaries' then remembered their bank accounts."" Slavery frequently showed the limitations of the Enlightenment ideology as it pertained to European colonialism, since many colonies of Europe operated on a plantation economy fueled by slave labor. In 1791, the Haitian Revolution, a slave rebellion by emancipated slaves against French colonial rule in the colony of Saint-Domingue, broke out. European nations and the United States, despite the strong support for Enlightenment ideals, refused to ""[give support] to Saint-Domingue's anti-colonial struggle."" The very existence of an English Enlightenment has been hotly debated by scholars. The majority of textbooks on British history make little or no mention of an English Enlightenment. Some surveys of the entire Enlightenment include England and others ignore it, although they do include coverage of such major intellectuals as Joseph Addison, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Alexander Pope, Joshua Reynolds, and Jonathan Swift. Freethinking, a term describing those who stood in opposition to the institution of the Church, and the literal belief in the Bible, can be said to have begun in England no later than 1713, when Anthony Collins wrote his ""Discourse of Free-thinking,"" which gained substantial popularity. This essay attacked the clergy of all churches and was a plea for deism. Roy Porter argues that the reasons for this neglect were the assumptions that the movement was primarily French-inspired, that it was largely a-religious or anti-clerical, and that it stood in outspoken defiance to the established order. Porter admits that after the 1720s England could claim thinkers to equal Diderot, Voltaire, or Rousseau. However, its leading intellectuals such as Gibbon, Edmund Burke and Samuel Johnson were all quite conservative and supportive of the standing order. Porter says the reason was that Enlightenment had come early to England and had succeeded such that the culture had accepted political liberalism, philosophical empirici",Wiki
Agronomy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agronomy,"Agronomy, generally known as agriculture, is the science and technology of producing and using plants by agriculture for food, fuel, fiber, chemicals, recreation, or land conservation. Agronomy has come to include research of plant genetics, plant physiology, meteorology, and soil science. It is the application of a combination of sciences such as biology, chemistry, economics, ecology, earth science, and genetics. Professionals of agronomy are termed agronomists. Early humans practiced hunter-gathering, but by around 10,000 BCE, they began to domesticate plants like wheat, barley and rice. This laid the foundation for agriculture. Ancient civilizations such as the Sumerians, Egyptians and Romans made significant advances in farming. They introduced irrigation systems, crop rotation, and early forms of fertilization. During this period, agricultural knowledge remained relatively static in Europe, though Islamic scholars made advances in agronomy. Ibn al-'Awwam, a 12th-century Andalusian agronomist, wrote the Kitāb al-Filāḥa, a comprehensive guide on farming practices, crop management and soil conservation. The Renaissance saw a renewed interest in scientific exploration, including agriculture. Leonardo da Vinci and other scholars contributed to early agronomic theory, studying plant growth, crop rotation, and animal husbandry. Agronomy emerged as a distinct scientific discipline in the 1800s, driven by advancements in chemistry and biology. The development of scientific methods led to the study of plant physiology, soil chemistry, and the role of fertilizers in crop production. Justus von Liebig, a German chemist, made groundbreaking discoveries about plant nutrition, establishing that plants require specific minerals, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, for growth. In the early 20th century, industrialization began transforming agriculture. Mechanization, the development of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, and improved crop varieties, led to higher agricultural productivity. The Green Revolution (1940s-1960s), led by scientists like Norman Borlaug, introduced high-yield crop varieties and modern farming techniques, helping to avert hunger in many parts of the world. By the late same century, concerns over the environmental impact of industrial agriculture, such as soil degradation, water pollution, and biodiversity loss, led to a push toward sustainable agriculture. Today agronomy continues to adapt to challenges of climate change, global food security and the need to balance productivity with environmental stewardship. This topic of agronomy involves selective breeding of plants to produce the best crops for various conditions. Plant breeding has increased crop yields and has improved the nutritional value of numerous crops, including corn, soybeans, and wheat. It has also resulted in the development of new types of plants. For example, a hybrid grain named triticale was produced by crossbreeding rye and wheat. Triticale contains more usable protein than does either rye or wheat. Agronomy has also been instrumental for fruit and vegetable production research. Furthermore, the application of plant breeding for turfgrass development has resulted in a reduction in the demand for fertilizer and water inputs (requirements), as well as turf-types with higher disease resistance. Agronomists use biotechnology to extend and expedite the development of desired characteristics. Biotechnology is often a laboratory activity requiring field testing of new crop varieties that are developed. In addition to increasing crop yields agronomic biotechnology is being applied increasingly for novel uses other than food. For example, oilseed is at present used mainly for margarine and other food oils, but it can be modified to produce fatty acids for detergents, substitute fuels and petrochemicals. Agronomists study sustainable ways to make soils more productive and profitable. They classify soils and analyze them to determine whether they contain nutrients vital for plant growth. Common macronutrients analyzed include compounds of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. Soil is also assessed for several micronutrients, like zinc and boron. The percentage of organic matter, soil pH, and nutrient holding capacity (cation exchange capacity) are tested in a regional laboratory. Agronomists will interpret these laboratory reports and make recommendations to modify soil nutrients for optimal plant growth. Additionally, agronomists develop methods to preserve soil and decrease the effects of [erosion] by wind and water. For example, a technique known as contour plowing may be used to prevent soil erosion and conserve rainfall. Researchers of agronomy also seek ways to use the soil more effectively for solving other problems. Such problems include the disposal of human and animal manure, water pollution, and pesticide accumulation in the soil, as well as preserving the soil for future generations such as the burning of paddocks after crop production. Pasture management techniques include no-till farming, planting of soil-binding grasses along contours on steep slopes, and using contour drains of depths as much as 1 metre. Agroecology is the management of agricultural systems with an emphasis on ecological and environmental applications. This topic is associated closely with work for sustainable agriculture, organic farming, and alternative food systems and the development of alternative cropping systems. Theoretical production ecology is the quantitative study of the growth of crops. The plant is treated as a kind of biological factory, which processes light, carbon dioxide, water, and nutrients into harvestable products. The main parameters are temperature, sunlight, standing crop biomass, plant production distribution, and nutrient and water supply.[citation needed]",Wiki
Agrostology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrostology,"Agrostology (from Greek ἄγρωστις, agrōstis, ""type of grass""; and -λογία, -logia), sometimes graminology, is the scientific study of the grasses (the family Poaceae, or Gramineae). The grasslike species of the sedge family (Cyperaceae), the rush family (Juncaceae), and the bulrush or cattail family (Typhaceae) are often included with the true grasses in the category of graminoid, although strictly speaking these are not included within the study of agrostology. In contrast to the word graminoid, the words gramineous and graminaceous are normally used to mean ""of, or relating to, the true grasses (Poaceae)"". Agrostology has importance in the maintenance of wild and grazed grasslands, agriculture (crop plants such as rice, maize, sugarcane, and wheat are grasses, and many types of animal fodder are grasses), urban and environmental horticulture, turfgrass management and sod production, ecology, and conservation.

Alga,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alga,"Algae (UK: /ˈælɡiː/ AL-ghee, US: /ˈældʒiː/ AL-jee; sg.: alga /ˈælɡə/ AL-gə) is an informal term for any organisms of a large and diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotes, which include species from multiple distinct clades. Such organisms range from unicellular microalgae such as Chlorella, Prototheca and the diatoms, to multicellular macroalgae such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 metres (160 ft) in length. Most algae are aquatic organisms and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem and phloem that are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds. In contrast, the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, Spirogyra and stoneworts. Algae that are carried passively by water are plankton, specifically phytoplankton. Algae constitute a polyphyletic group since they do not include a common ancestor, and although their chlorophyll-bearing plastids seem to have a single origin (from symbiogenesis with cyanobacteria), they were acquired in different ways. Green algae are a prominent example of algae that have primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiont cyanobacteria. Diatoms and brown algae are examples of algae with secondary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiotic red algae, which they acquired via phagocytosis. Algae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies, from simple asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual reproduction via spores. Algae lack the various structures that characterize plants (which evolved from freshwater green algae), such as the phyllids (leaf-like structures) and rhizoids of bryophytes (non-vascular plants), and the roots, leaves and other xylemic/phloemic organs found in tracheophytes (vascular plants). Most algae are autotrophic, although some are mixotrophic, deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy, myzotrophy or phagotrophy. Some unicellular species of green algae, many golden algae, euglenids, dinoflagellates, and other algae have become heterotrophs (also called colorless or apochlorotic algae), sometimes parasitic, relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus. Some other heterotrophic organisms, such as the apicomplexans, are also derived from cells whose ancestors possessed chlorophyllic plastids, but are not traditionally considered as algae. Algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria that produce oxygen as a byproduct of splitting water molecules, unlike other organisms that conduct anoxygenic photosynthesis such as purple and green sulfur bacteria. Fossilized filamentous algae from the Vindhya basin have been dated to 1.6 to 1.7 billion years ago. Because of the wide range of types of algae, there is a correspondingly wide range of industrial and traditional applications in human society. Traditional seaweed farming practices have existed for thousands of years and have strong traditions in East Asian food cultures. More modern algaculture applications extend the food traditions for other applications, including cattle feed, using algae for bioremediation or pollution control, transforming sunlight into algae fuels or other chemicals used in industrial processes, and in medical and scientific applications. A 2020 review found that these applications of algae could play an important role in carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change while providing lucrative value-added products for global economies. The singular alga is the Latin word for 'seaweed' and retains that meaning in English. The etymology is obscure. Although some speculate that it is related to Latin algēre, 'be cold', no reason is known to associate seaweed with temperature. A more likely source is alliga, 'binding, entwining'. The Ancient Greek word for 'seaweed' was φῦκος (phŷkos), which could mean either the seaweed (probably red algae) or a red dye derived from it. The Latinization, fūcus, meant primarily the cosmetic rouge. The etymology is uncertain, but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the Biblical פוך (pūk), 'paint' (if not that word itself), a cosmetic eye-shadow used by the ancient Egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern Mediterranean. It could be any color: black, red, green, or blue. The study of algae is most commonly called phycology (from Greek phykos 'seaweed'); the term algology is falling out of use. One definition of algae is that they ""have chlorophyll as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack a sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells"". On the other hand, the colorless Prototheca under Chlorophyta are all devoid of any chlorophyll. Although cyanobacteria are often referred to as ""blue-green algae"", most authorities exclude all prokaryotes, including cyanobacteria, from the definition of algae. The algae contain chloroplasts that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts contain circular DNA like that in cyanobacteria and are interpreted as representing reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. However, the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae, reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events. The table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae. Their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right. Many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic. Some retain plastids, but not chloroplasts, while others have lost plastids entirely. Phylogeny based on plastid not nucleocytoplasmic genealogy: Cyanobacteria Glaucophytes Rhodophytes Stramenopiles Cryptophytes Haptophytes Euglenophytes Chlorarachniophytes Chlorophytes Charophytes Land plants (Embryophyta) These groups have green chloroplasts containing chlorophylls a and b. Their chloroplasts are surrounded by four and three membranes, respectively, and were probably retained from ingested green algae. Chlorarachniophytes, which belong to the phylum Cercozoa, contain a small nucleomorph, which is a relict of the algae's nucleus. Euglenids, which belong to the phylum Euglenozoa, live primarily in fresh water and have chloroplasts with only three membranes. The endosymbiotic green algae may have been acquired through myzocytosis rather than phagocytosis. (Another group with green algae endosymbionts is the dinoflagellate genus Lepidodinium, which has replaced its original endosymbiont of red algal origin with one of green algal origin. A nucleomorph is present, and the host genome still have several red algal genes acquired through endosymbiotic gene transfer. Also, the euglenid and chlorarachniophyte genome contain genes of apparent red algal ancestry) These groups have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls a and c, and phycobilins. The shape can vary; they may be of discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral, or ribbon shaped. They have one or more pyrenoids to preserve protein and starch. The latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts, but genetic similarities with red algae suggest a relationship there. In the first three of these groups, (Chromista), the chloroplast has four membranes, retaining a nucleomorph in cryptomonads, and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor, although other evidence casts doubt on whether the heterokonts, Haptophyta, and cryptomonads are in fact more closely related to each other than to other groups. The typical dinoflagellate chloroplast has three membranes, but considerable diversity exists in chloroplasts within the group, and a number of endosymbiotic events apparently occurred. The Apicomplexa, a group of closely related parasites, also have plastids called apicoplasts, which are not photosynthetic, but appear to have a common origin with dinoflagellate chloroplasts. Linnaeus, in Species Plantarum (1753), the starting point for modern botanical nomenclature, recognized 14 genera of algae, of which only four are currently considered among algae. In Systema Naturae, Linnaeus described the genera Volvox and Corallina, and a species of Acetabularia (as Madrepora), among the animals. In 1768, Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin (1744–1774) published the Historia Fucorum, the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on marine biology to use the then new binomial nomenclature of Linnaeus. It included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves. W. H. Harvey (1811–1866) and Lamouroux (1813) were the first to divide macroscopic algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation. This is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics. Harvey's four divisions are: red algae (Rhodospermae), brown algae (Melanospermae), green algae (Chlorospermae), and Diatomaceae. At this time, microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of workers (e.g., O. F. Müller and Ehrenberg) studying the Infusoria (microscopic organisms). Unlike macroalgae, which were clearly viewed as plants, microalgae were frequently considered animals because they are often motile. Even the nonmotile (coccoid) microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the lifecycle of plants, macroalgae, or animals. Although used as a taxonomic category in some pre-Darwinian classifications, e.g., Linnaeus (1753), de Jussieu (1789), Lamouroux (1813), Harvey (1836), Horaninow (1843), Agassiz (1859), Wilson & Cassin (1864), in further classifications, the ""algae"" are seen as an artificial, polyphyletic group. Throughout the 20th century, most classifications treated the following groups as divisions or classes of algae: cyanophytes, rhodophytes, chrysophytes, xanthophytes, bacillariophytes, phaeophytes, pyrrhophytes (cryptophytes and dinophytes), euglenophytes, and chlorophytes. Later, many new groups were discovered (e.g., Bolidophyceae), and others were splintered from older groups: charophytes and glaucophytes (from chlorophytes), many heterokontophytes (e.g., synurophytes from chrysophytes, or eustigmatophytes from xanthophytes), haptophytes (from chrysophytes), and chlorarachniophytes (from xanthophytes). With the abandonment of plant-animal dichotomous classification, most groups of algae (sometimes all) were included in Protista, later also abandoned in favour of Eukaryota. However, as a legacy of the older plant life scheme, some groups that were also treated as protozoans in the past still have duplicated classifications (see ambiregnal protists). Some parasitic algae (e.g., the green algae Prototheca and Helicosporidium, parasites of metazoans, or Cephaleuros, parasites of plants) were originally classified as fungi, sporozoans, or protistans of incertae sedis, while others (e.g., the green algae Phyllosiphon and Rhodochytrium, parasites of plants, or the red algae Pterocladiophila and Gelidiocolax mammillatus, parasites of other red algae, or the dinoflagellates Oodinium, parasites of fish) had their relationship with algae conjectured early. In other cases, some groups were originally characterized as parasitic algae (e.g., Chlorochytrium), but later were seen as endophytic algae. Some filamentous bacteria (e.g., Beggiatoa) were originally seen as algae. Furthermore, groups like the apicomplexans are also parasites derived from ancestors that possessed plastids, but are not included in any group traditionally seen as algae. Algae are polyphyletic thus their origin cannot be traced back to single hypothetical common ancestor. It is thought that they came into existence when photosynthetic coccoid cyanobacteria got phagocytized by a unicellular heterotrophic eukaryote (a protist), giving rise to double-membranous primary plastids. Such symbiogenic events (primary symbiogenesis) are believed to have occurred more than 1.5 billion years ago during the Calymmian period, early in Boring Billion, but it is difficult to track the key events because of so much time gap. Primary symbiogenesis gave rise to three divisions of archaeplastids, namely the Viridiplantae (green algae and later plants), Rhodophyta (red algae) and Glaucophyta (""grey algae""), whose plastids further spread into other protist lineages through eukaryote-eukaryote predation, engulfments and subsequent endosymbioses (secondary and tertiary symbiogenesis). This process of serial cell ""capture"" and ""enslavement"" explains the diversity of photosynthetic eukaryotes. Recent genomic and phylogenomic approaches have significantly clarified plastid genome evolution, the horizontal movement of endosymbiont genes to the ""host"" nuclear genome, and plastid spread throughout the eukaryotic tree of life. Fossils of isolated spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as 475 million years ago (mya) during the Late Cambrian/Early Ordovician period, from sessile shallow freshwater charophyte algae much like Chara, which likely got stranded ashore when riverine/lacustrine water levels dropped during dry seasons. These charophyte algae probably already developed filamentous thalli and holdfasts that superficially resembled plant stems and roots, and probably had an isomorphic alternation of generations. They perhaps evolved some 850 mya and might even be as early as 1 Gya during the late phase of the Boring Billion. A range of algal morphologies is exhibited, and convergence of features in unrelated groups is common. The only groups to exhibit three-dimensional multicellular thalli are the reds and browns, and some chlorophytes. Apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups: the florideophyte reds, various browns, and the charophytes. The form of charophytes is quite different from those of reds and browns, because they have distinct nodes, separated by internode 'stems'; whorls of branches reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes. Conceptacles are another polyphyletic trait; they appear in the coralline algae and the Hildenbrandiales, as well as the browns. Most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboids, but colonial and nonmotile forms have developed independently among several of the groups. Some of the more common organizational levels, more than one of which may occur in the lifecycle of a species, are In three lines, even higher levels of organization have been reached, with full tissue differentiation. These are the brown algae,—some of which may reach 50 m in length (kelps)—the red algae, and the green algae. The most complex forms are found among the charophyte algae (see Charales and Charophyta), in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants. The innovation that defines these nonalgal plants is the presence of female reproductive organs with protective cell layers that protect the zygote and developing embryo. Hence, the land plants are referred to as the Embryophytes. The term algal turf is commonly used but poorly defined. Algal turfs are thick, carpet-like beds of seaweed that retain sediment and compete with foundation species like corals and kelps, and they are usually less than 15 cm tall. Such a turf may consist of one or more species, and will generally cover an area in the order of a square metre or more. Some common characteristics are listed: Many algae, particularly species of the Characeae, have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the water permeability of membranes, osmoregulation, salt tolerance, cytoplasmic streaming, and the generation of action potentials. Plant hormones are found not only in higher plants, but in algae, too. Some species of algae form symbiotic relationships with other organisms. In these symbioses, the algae supply photosynthates (organic substances) to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells. The host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae. Examples are: Lichens are defined by the International Association for Lichenology to be ""an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure"". The fungi, or mycobionts, are mainly from the Ascomycota with a few from the Basidiomycota. In nature, they do not occur separate from lichens. It is unknown when they began to associate. One or more mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species, from the green algae, except that alternatively, the mycobiont may associate with a species of cyanobacteria (hence ""photobiont"" is the more accurate term). A photobiont may be associated with many different mycobionts or may live independently; accordingly, lichens are named and classified as fungal species. The association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone (they can be experimentally isolated). The photobiont possibly triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont. Trentepohlia is an example of a common green alga genus worldwide that can grow on its own or be lichenised. Lichen thus share some of the habitat and often similar appearance with specialized species of algae (aerophytes) growing on exposed surfaces such as tree trunks and rocks and sometimes discoloring them. Coral reefs are accumulated from the calcareous exoskeletons of marine invertebrates of the order Scleractinia (stony corals). These animals metabolize sugar and oxygen to obtain energy for their cell-building processes, including secretion of the exoskeleton, with water and carbon dioxide as byproducts. Dinoflagellates (algal protists) are often endosymbionts in the cells of the coral-forming marine invertebrates, where they accelerate host-cell metabolism by generating sugar and oxygen immediately available through photosynthesis using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced by the host. Reef-building stony corals (hermatypic corals) require endosymbiotic algae from the genus Symbiodinium to be in a healthy condition. The loss of Symbiodinium from the host is known as coral bleaching, a condition which leads to the deterioration of a reef. Endosymbiontic green algae live close to the surface of some sponges, for example, breadcrumb sponges (Halichondria panicea). The alga is thus protected from predators; the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80% of sponge growth in some species. Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta, and Heterokontophyta, the three main algal divisions, have life cycles which show considerable variation and complexity. In general, an asexual phase exists where the seaweed's cells are diploid, a sexual phase where the cells are haploid, followed by fusion of the male and female gametes. Asexual reproduction permits efficient population increases, but less variation is possible. Commonly, in sexual reproduction of unicellular and colonial algae, two specialized, sexually compatible, haploid gametes make physical contact and fuse to form a zygote. To ensure a successful mating, the development and release of gametes is highly synchronized and regulated; pheromones may play a key role in these processes. Sexual reproduction allows for more variation and provides the benefit of efficient recombinational repair of DNA damages during meiosis, a key stage of the sexual cycle. However, sexual reproduction is more costly than asexual reproduction. Meiosis has been shown to occur in many different species of algae. The Algal Collection of the US National Herbarium (located in the National Museum of Natural History) consists of approximately 320,500 dried specimens, which, although not exhaustive (no exhaustive collection exists), gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species (that number remains unknown). Estimates vary widely. For example, according to one standard textbook, in the British Isles, the UK Biodiversity Steering Group Report estimated there to be 20,000 algal species in the UK. Another checklist reports only about 5,000 species. Regarding the difference of about 15,000 species, the text concludes: ""It will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of species ..."" Regional and group estimates have been made, as well: and so on, but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources, these numbers have no more credibility than the British ones mentioned above. Most estimates also omit microscopic algae, such as phytoplankton. The most recent estimate suggests 72,500 algal species worldwide. The distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the mid-19th century. Algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of cryptogamic plants by spores. Spores can be found in a variety of environments: fresh and marine waters, air, soil, and in or on other organisms. Whether a spore is to grow into an adult organism depends on the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands. The spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind, as well as by living carriers. However, not all bodies of water can carry all species of algae, as the chemical composition of certain water bodies limits the algae that can survive within them. Marine spores are often spread by ocean currents. Ocean water presents many vastly different habitats based on temperature and nutrient availability, resulting in phytogeographic zones, regions, and provinces. To some degree, the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features, such as Antarctica, long distances of ocean or general land masses. It is, therefore, possible to identify species occurring by locality, such as ""Pacific algae"" or ""North Sea algae"". When they occur out of their localities, hypothesizing a transport mechanism is usually possible, such as the hulls of ships. For example, Ulva reticulata and U. fasciata travelled from the mainland to Hawaii in this manner. Mapping is possible for select species only: ""there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns."" For example, Clathromorphum is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there.[where?] However, scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the ""difficulties of undertaking such studies."" Algae are prominent in bodies of water, common in terrestrial environments, and are found in unusual environments, such as on snow and ice. Seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters, under 100 m (330 ft) deep; however, some such as Navicula pennata have been recorded to a depth of 360 m (1,180 ft). A type of algae, Ancylonema nordenskioeldii, was found in Greenland in areas known as the 'Dark Zone', which caused an increase in the rate of melting ice sheet. The same algae was found in the Italian Alps, after pink ice appeared on parts of the Presena glacier. The various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology. Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column (phytoplankton) provide the food base for most marine food chains. In very high densities (algal blooms), these algae may discolor the water and outcompete, poison, or asphyxiate other life forms. Algae can be used as indicator organisms to monitor pollution in various aquatic systems. In many cases, algal metabolism is sensitive to various pollutants. Due to this, the species composition of algal populations may shift in the presence of chemical pollutants. To detect these changes, algae can be sampled from the environment and maintained in laboratories with relative ease. On the basis of their habitat, algae can be categorized as: aquatic (planktonic, benthic, marine, freshwater, lentic, lotic), terrestrial, aerial (subaerial), lithophytic, halophytic (or euryhaline), psammon, thermophilic, cryophilic, epibiont (epiphytic, epizoic), endosymbiont (endophytic, endozoic), parasitic, calcifilic or lichenic (phycobiont). In classical Chinese, the word 藻 is used both for ""algae"" and (in the modest tradition of the imperial scholars) for ""literary talent"". The third island in Kunming Lake beside the Summer Palace in Beijing is known as the Zaojian Tang Dao (藻鑒堂島), which thus simultaneously means ""Island of the Algae-Viewing Hall"" and ""Island of the Hall for Reflecting on Literary Talent"". Algaculture is a form of aquaculture involving the farming of species of algae. The majority of algae that are intentionally cultivated fall into the category of microalgae (also referred to as phytoplankton, microphytes, or planktonic algae). Macroalgae, commonly known as seaweed, also have many commercial and industrial uses, but due to their size and the specific requirements of the environment in which they need to grow, they do not lend themselves as readily to cultivation (this may change, however, with the advent of newer seaweed cultivators, which are basically algae scrubbers using upflowing air bubbles in small containers, known as tumble culture). Commercial and industrial algae cultivation has numerous uses, including production of nutraceuticals such as omega-3 fatty acids (as algal oil) or natural food colorants and dyes, food, fertilizers, bioplastics, chemical feedstock (raw material), protein-rich animal/aquaculture feed, pharmaceuticals, and algal fuel, and can also be used as a means of pollution control and natural carbon sequestration. Global production of farmed aquatic plants, overwhelmingly dominated by seaweeds, grew in output volume from 13.5 million tonnes in 1995, to just over 30 million tonnes in 2016 and 37.8 million tonnes in 2022. This increase was the result of production expansions led by China, followed by Malaysia, the Philippines, the United Republic of Tanzania, the Russian Federation. Seaweed farming or kelp farming is the practice of cultivating and harvesting seaweed. In its simplest form farmers gather from natural beds, while at the other extreme farmers fully control the crop's life cycle. The seven most cultivated taxa are Eucheuma spp., Kappaphycus alvarezii, Gracilaria spp., Saccharina japonica, Undaria pinnatifida, Pyropia spp., and Sargassum fusiforme. Eucheuma and K. alvarezii are attractive for carrageenan (a gelling agent); Gracilaria is farmed for agar; the rest are eaten after limited processing. Seaweeds are different from mangroves and seagrasses, as they are photosynthetic algal organisms and are non-flowering. The largest seaweed-producing countries as of 2022 are China (58.62%) and Indonesia (28.6%); followed by South Korea (5.09%) and the Philippines (4.19%). Other notable producers include North Korea (1.6%), Japan (1.15%), Malaysia (0.53%), Zanzibar (Tanzania, 0.5%), and Chile (0.3%). Seaweed farming has frequently been developed to improve economic conditions and to reduce fishing pressure. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported that world production in 2019 was over 35 million tonnes. North America produced some 23,000 tonnes of wet seaweed. Alaska, Maine, France, and Norway each more than doubled their seaweed production since 2018. As of 2019, seaweed represented 30% of marine aquaculture. In 2023, the global seaweed extract market was valued at $16.5 billion, with strong projected growth. An algae bioreactor is used for cultivating micro or macroalgae. Algae may be cultivated for the purposes of biomass production (as in a seaweed cultivator), wastewater treatment, CO2 fixation, or aquarium/pond filtration in the form of an algae scrubber. Algae bioreactors vary widely in design, falling broadly into two categories: open reactors and enclosed reactors. Open reactors are exposed to the atmosphere while enclosed reactors, also commonly called photobioreactors, are isolated to varying extents from the atmosphere. Specifically, algae bioreactors can be used to produce fuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol, to generate animal feed, or to reduce pollutants such as NOx and CO2 in flue Agar, a gelatinous substance derived from red algae, has a number of commercial uses. It is a good medium on which to grow bacteria and fungi, as most microorganisms cannot digest agar. Alginic acid, or alginate, is extracted from brown algae. Its uses range from gelling agents in food, to medical dressings. Alginic acid also has been used in the field of biotechnology as a biocompatible medium for cell encapsulation and cell immobilization. Molecular cuisine is also a user of the substance for its gelling properties, by which it becomes a delivery vehicle for flavours. Between 100,000 and 170,000 wet tons of Macrocystis are harvested annually in New Mexico for alginate extraction and abalone feed. To be competitive and independent from fluctuating support from (local) policy on the long run, biofuels should equal or beat the cost level of fossil fuels. Here, algae-based fuels hold great promise, directly related to the potential to produce more biomass per unit area in a year than any other form of biomass. The break-even point for algae-based biofuels is estimated to occur by 2025. For centuries, seaweed has been used as a fertilizer; George Owen of Henllys writing in the 16th century referring to drift weed in South Wales: This kind of ore they often gather and lay on great heapes, where it heteth and rotteth, and will have a strong and loathsome smell; when being so rotten they cast on the land, as they do their muck, and thereof springeth good corn, especially barley ... After spring-tydes or great rigs of the sea, they fetch it in sacks on horse backes, and carie the same three, four, or five miles, and cast it on the lande, which doth very much better the ground for corn and grass. Today, algae are used by humans in many ways; for example, as fertilizers, soil conditioners, and livestock feed. Aquatic and microscopic species are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and are either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds. Algaculture on a large scale is an important type of aquaculture in some places. Maerl is commonly used as a soil conditioner. Algae are used as foods in many countries: China consumes more than 70 species, including fat choy, a cyanobacterium considered a vegetable; Japan, over 20 species such as nori and aonori; Ireland, dulse; Chile, cochayuyo. Laver is used to make laverbread in Wales, where it is known as bara lawr. In Korea, green laver is used to make gim. Three forms of algae used as food: The oils from some algae have high levels of unsaturated fatty acids. Some varieties of algae favored by vegetarianism and veganism contain the long-chain, essential omega-3 fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Fish oil contains the omega-3 fatty acids, but the original source is algae (microalgae in particular), which are eaten by marine life such as copepods and are passed up the food chain. Agricultural Research Service scientists found that 60–90% of nitrogen runoff and 70–100% of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluents using a horizontal algae scrubber, also called an algal turf scrubber (ATS). Scientists developed the ATS, which consists of shallow, 100-foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form, and studied its efficacy for three years. They found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers, streams, and oceans. Researchers collected and dried the nutrient-rich algae from the ATS and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer. They found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ATS organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers. Algae scrubbers, using bubbling upflow or vertical waterfall versions, are now also being used to filter aquaria and ponds. Various polymers can be created from algae, which can be especially useful in the creation of bioplastics. These include hybrid plastics, cellulose-based plastics, poly-lactic acid, and bio-polyethylene. Several companies have begun to produce algae pol",Wiki
Allen_Frances,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Frances,"Allen J. Frances (born 2 October 1942) is an American psychiatrist. He is currently Professor and Chairman Emeritus of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Duke University School of Medicine. He is best known for serving as chair of the American Psychiatric Association task force overseeing the development and revision of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Frances is the founding editor of two well-known psychiatric journals: the Journal of Personality Disorders and the Journal of Psychiatric Practice. During the development of the current diagnostic manual, DSM-5, Frances became critical of the expanding boundaries of psychiatry and the medicalization of normal human behavior, problems he contends are leading to the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of the ""worried well"" and the gross undertreatment of the severely ill. In recent years, Frances has become a vocal advocate for improved treatment and societal conditions for the seriously mentally ill, the appropriate use of electroconvulsive therapy in severe cases of mental disorder, and an integrated, biopsychosocial approach to psychiatry. Frances is the author or co-author of multiple books within the fields of psychiatry and psychology, including: Differential Therapeutics (1984), Your Mental Health (1999), Saving Normal (2013), Essentials of Psychiatric Diagnosis (2013), and Twilight of American Sanity (2017). Frances was born and raised in New York City, US. He received his bachelor's degree from Columbia College in 1963 and his medical degree in 1967 from SUNY Downstate College of Medicine. He graduated from the psychiatry residency training program at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in 1971 and received a certificate in psychoanalytic medicine from Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research in 1978. His research in the fields of psychiatry and behavioral sciences focused on schizophrenia, personality disorders, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and clinical treatment of psychiatric patients. Frances' early career was spent at Cornell University Medical College, where he rose to the rank of professor, headed the outpatient department, saw patients, taught, established a brief therapy program, and developed research specialty clinics for schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, and AIDS. Throughout his academic career, Frances was an active investigator and prolific author in a surprisingly wide range of clinical areas including personality disorders, chronic depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, AIDS, and psychotherapy. In 1991, he became chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Duke University School of Medicine, where he helped to expand the research, training, and clinical programs that had been initiated by his predecessor as chair, Dr. Bernard Carroll. Frances had originally viewed himself as a teacher and clinician but his administrative posts—as director of an outpatient department, chair of a psychiatry department, and chair of the DSM-IV Task Force—thrust him into more of a research role. He was an early organizer of outpatient services based on a given psychiatric disorder, providing expert clinical services and enriched research environments. In all, Frances received a dozen research grants as principal or co-principal investigator, most from the National Institute of Mental Health and published extensively on personality disorders, chronic depression, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, the psychiatric aspects of AIDS, and various aspects of psychiatric diagnosis. He also mentored the careers of many other researchers. Frances' book on Differential Therapeutics (1984) tried to bring specificity and evidence to decisions on how best to match patient and treatment. His recognition of therapeutic limits resulted in the 1981 paper No Treatment as the Prescription of Choice. Frances was the founding editor of two journals that have become standards: The Journal of Personality Disorders and the Journal of Psychiatric Practice. In 2013, Allen Frances wrote a paper entitled ""The New Crisis of Confidence in Psychiatric Diagnosis"", which said that ""psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests"". Frances was also concerned about ""unpredictable overdiagnosis"". Robert Spitzer, later the major force behind DSM-III, was one of Frances' teachers during his psychiatric residency at Columbia University and attempted to recruit him to participate in his research developing standardized criteria for mental disorders and interviewing instruments for diagnostic assessment. Frances declined the offer because he felt psychiatric treatment was much more interesting than psychiatric classification. Ten years later, in 1977, Spitzer attempted to recruit Frances again, this time to join his work on DSM-III. Frances accepted and was given three roles. He wrote the final draft of the personality disorders section of DSM-III; served as DSM-III liaison to the American Psychoanalytic Association and the Academy of Psychoanalysts; and he was a member of the team that delivered DSM-III educational conferences across the country. He wrote a number of papers on the uses and misuses of DSM-III and predicted DSM would eventually adopt a dimensional model of personality disorder diagnosis. Frances was appointed Chair of the DSM-IV Task Force in 1987. His selection followed his role as one of the major advisors for DSM-IIIR and reflected concerns within the American Psychiatric Association that new disorders were being added without sufficient evidence and that definitions of existing disorders were too loose. Frances was known as a diagnostic conservative who would promote stability in the system and discourage its rapid expansion across the fuzzy boundary into normality. He introduced a thorough three-stage vetting system to discourage diagnostic exuberance in DSM-IV: 1.) a thorough review of the existing literature had to produce compelling evidence in support of the suggested change; 2.) funding from the MacArthur Foundation allowed dozens of reanalyses of unpublished data sets to help answer questions pertinent to DSM-IV changes; and 3.) NIMH funding allowed for 11 field trials assessing how proposed changes would translate into clinical practice. The conservatism seemed to work. Of the 94 new diagnoses suggested for DSM-IV, only two were accepted: Asperger's syndrome and bipolar II disorder. Both had good supporting literature and both had performed well in field trials. However, Frances argued that any change in DSM-IV that could be misused, would be misused, and both changes led to unfortunate fads of wild overdiagnosis. Frances argues that there was also a fad of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder partly due to loosened diagnostic criteria but mostly due to pharmaceutical company marketing. The next revision DSM-5 was initiated with a 2002 book (A Research Agenda for DSM-V) questioning the utility of the atheoretical, descriptive paradigm and suggesting a neuroscience research agenda aiming to develop a pathophysiologically based classification. After a series of symposiums, the task force began to work on the manual itself. In June 2008, Dr. Robert Spitzer who chaired the DSM-III and DSM-IIIR revisions had begun to write about the secrecy of the DSM-V Task Force (DSM-V: Open and Transparent?). Frances initially declined to join Spitzer's criticism, but after learning about the changes being considered, he wrote an article in July 2009 (A Warning Sign on the Road to DSM-V: Beware of Its Unintended Consequences) expressing multiple concerns including the unsupported paradigm shift, a failure to specify the level of empirical support needed for changes, their lack of openness, their ignoring the negative consequences of their proposals, a failure to meet timelines, and anticipate the coming time pressures. The APA/DSM-V Task Force response dismissed his complaints. In March 2010, Frances began a weekly blog in Psychology Today, DSM-5 in Distress: The DSM's impact on mental health practice and research, often cross-posted in the Psychiatric Times and the Huffington Post. While many of his blog posts were about the DSM-5 Task Force lowering the thresholds for diagnosing existing disorders (attention deficit disorder, autism, addictions, personality disorders, bipolar II disorder), he was also disturbed by the addition of new speculative disorders (Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Somatic Symptom Disorder). He has argued that the diagnosis attenuated psychosis syndrome promoted by advocates of early intervention for psychosis, such as Australian psychiatrist Patrick McGorry, is risky because of a high rate of inaccuracy, the potential to stigmatize young people given this label, the lack of any effective treatment, and the risk of children and adolescents being given dangerous antipsychotic medication. The elimination of the bereavement exclusion from the diagnosis of major depressive disorder was another particular concern, threatening to label normal grief as a mental illness. So while the task force was focusing on early detection and treatment, Frances cautioned about diagnostic inflation, overmedication, and crossing the boundary of normality. Besides the original complaint that the DSM-5 Task Force was a closed process, Frances pointed out that they were behind schedule and even with a one-year postponement, they had to drop a follow-up quality control step. He recommended further postponement and advocated asking an outside body to review their work to make suggestions. While the American Psychiatric Association did have an internal review, they rejected his suggestion of an external consultation. When the field testing for inter-rater reliability was released in May 2012, several of the more contested disorders were eliminated as unreliable (attenuated psychosis syndrome, mixed anxiety depression) and the reliabilities were generally disappointing. The APA Board of Trustees eliminated a complex ""Cross-Cutting"" Dimensional System, but many of the contested areas remained when the document was approved for printing in December 2012 for a scheduled release in May 2013. There were widespread threats of a boycott. Frances's writings were joined by a general criticism of the DSM-5 revision, ultimately resulting in a petition calling for outside review signed by 14,000 and sponsored by 56 mental health organizations. In the course of almost three years of blogging, Frances became a voice for more than just the specifics of the DSM-5. He spoke out against the overuse of psychiatric medications—particularly in children; a general trend towards global diagnostic inflation—pathologizing normality; the intrusion of the pharmaceutical industry into psychiatric practice; and a premature attempt to move psychiatry to an exclusively biological paradigm without scientific justification. Along the way, he wrote two books: Saving Normal: An Insider's Revolt Against Out-of-Control Psychiatric Diagnosis, DSM-5, Big Pharma, and the Medicalization of Ordinary Life (2013), and Essentials of Psychiatric Diagnosis (2013), meant to guide clinicians and to help curb unwarranted diagnostic exuberance. He has decided to continue writing on a new Psychology Today blog called Saving Normal. Frances contends that while the deinstitutionalization movement was needed due to hospital overcrowding, frequent civil liberties violations, and poor conditions for hospitalized psychiatric patients, its implementation in the United States was an utter failure. In 2018, he wrote, The money saved from closing the custodial state hospitals was often misallocated to tax cuts and prison construction—depriving the mentally ill of adequate community treatment and housing. The result has been a broken American mental health ""non-system"" that overtreats the worried well and vastly undertreats the seriously mentally ill. Instead of 600,000 in state hospitals, we now have 350,000 mentally ill in prison and 250,000 homeless—because the vast majority is unable to obtain decent housing and access to treatment. Frances asserts that psychiatry itself has contributed to the neglect of the severely ill by diverting limited resources away from the community treatment of these patients and focusing instead on genetics research, neuroscience research, and the treatment of the mildly ill. He is particularly critical of NIMH spending excesses in the field of neuroscience, which he says have not helped a single patient in actual life. He is a proponent of a community psychiatry approach. He argues for the limited and safeguarded use of involuntary psychiatric hospitalization, writing that it is far preferable to the all-too-common alternatives: homelessness and imprisonment. Frances argues that with the gradual expansion of the DSM diagnostic system, psychiatry's attention has shifted away from the severely mentally ill and towards the treatment of the mildly ill or ""worried well."" This has led to several ""false epidemics"" of mental disorder, including autism and childhood bipolar disorder. He writes extensively about the pathologization of normal human behavior in his book Saving Normal, and provides guidance to clinicians to avoid these pitfalls in Essentials of Psychiatric Diagnosis. During the DSM-5 revision process, he was particularly critical of the concepts of psychosis risk syndrome, binge eating disorder, and mild neurocognitive disorder. Frances is a proponent of the safe and appropriate use of electroconvulsive therapy in severe and treatment-resistant cases of mental disorder; the use of lithium therapy for bipolar disorder; and the use of clozapine for schizophrenia. Regarding electroconvulsive therapy, Frances argues that the treatment can be lifesaving in cases of severe, unrelenting depression and in some other psychiatric disorders, such as malignant, or lethal, catatonia. He has repeatedly asserted that if he were severely depressed, he would agree to electroconvulsive treatment. Frances has expressed his belief that both lithium carbonate and clozapine are underutilized in the treatment of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, respectively, often in favor of newer, more profitable second-generation antipsychotic drugs. The current consensus in global psychiatry is that both lithium and clozapine remain the most effective agents in the treatment of their respective conditions; among academic psychiatrists, their underutilization is widely recognized. Frances has expressed skepticism over the use of ketamine in the treatment of clinical depression, writing that even if it is narrowly indicated in treatment-resistant mood disorder, ""ketamine promotionals will encourage many people to start using it as self-medication for distress–a practice that is filled with risk and falls far outside any possible reasonable use of ketamine."" Frances has advocated for the widespread use of binding advanced directives allowing patients to determine when they are well what treatments they would like to receive should they have a psychotic relapse. Most psychiatric patients are competent to decide whether or not they want treatment and to pick which treatments they prefer from the available alternatives—but patients with acute psychotic disorders often temporarily lose this capacity and refuse desperately needed treatment to help prevent imprisonment or homelessness. Studies show that most patients with bipolar disorder, once recovered, realize their judgment was dangerously impaired during past acute episodes and welcome the chance to plan advanced directives for involuntary treatment, should this be needed during future episodes. Giving others permission in advance to impose treatment, should it become necessary, takes away much of the anger, mistrust, helplessness, and humiliation patients feel when they have no say in their fate. Frances argues that advanced directives are perhaps the only intervention in psychiatry that is without a downside. Relapses are much shorter and less harmful when treated promptly. Accepting that future relapses can occur provides patients with the strongest possible incentive to reduce their probability by participating fully in preventive disease management. And ideological and legal controversies about the role of coercion in psychiatry usually dissolve in the cooperation forged by jointly facing clinical reality. Frances contends that advanced directives make sense for patients who have previously required involuntary treatment. Discussion of advanced directives might help restore a fractured therapeutic relationship by explaining why the coercion seemed necessary in the past and suggesting how it can be avoided in the future. It is more of a case-by-case decision whether to discuss directives with patients who have never before opposed treatment—directives most indicated for those whose acute episodes are severe, dangerous, frequent, and prolonged. The best time to begin discussing advanced directives is soon after insight returns following an acute episode and it is almost always helpful to include family in the discussion. Trained as a psychoanalyst, Frances taught the Freud course at the Columbia Psychoanalytic Center for a decade starting in the late 1970s. He has said that his ""favorite work activity throughout [his] career was doing and teaching psychodynamic psychotherapy."" Some of his early work was on the study and treatment of personality disorder. Frances contends that guild wars within psychotherapy have hurt the profession and those it treats; like Marvin Goldfried, he is a proponent of psychotherapy integration. He has said that the biggest mistake made by American psychoanalysis was their rejection of Aaron Beck's cognitive behavior therapy. Regarding Freud, Frances has said that Freud was ""overvalued in his day and is now undervalued in ours."" Frances is a proponent of George Engel's biopsychosocial model of mental disorder, writing that the ""biopsychosocial model of mental illness and mental health care created a conceptual underpinning of psychiatric practice."" Frances is critical of reductionistic theories in psychiatry and psychology; in any mental disorder, biological, psychological, and social factors are working in tandem to create and maintain dysfunction. During his residency training, Frances became dismayed at the long length of hospital stays and overtreatment with psychiatric drugs. Later, as head of the outpatient department at Cornell, Frances noted that many patients failed to benefit from treatment, and some seemed to be harmed by it. This led to his 1982 paper, ""No Treatment as the Prescription of Choice,"" and his career-long efforts to warn clinicians against overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Frances has much in common with critics of psychiatry who oppose overdiagnosis and overtreatment, but is much opposed to those who preach that psychiatric treatment is always harmful and never necessary. He frequently debated antipsychiatrists at conferences and in print, arguing that treatments overvalued to the many were essential to the few. The five percent of the population with severe mental illness do not do well without medication and often wind up in jail or living on the streets unless treatment is provided. He believes that antipsychiatry is a useful check against psychiatric overreach but that it is extremely harmful when it discourages patients from getting the treatment they need. Throughout his career, Frances has maintained that psychotherapy represents a core, foundational skill in the practice of clinical psychiatry. He counts, among others, Silvano Arieti, Sherv Frazier, Nathan Ackerman, Lawrence Kolb, John Talbott, Leon Salzman, Howard Hunt, Harold Searles, Aaron Beck, and Marsha Linehan as his greatest mentors on psychotherapy. While initially trained in psychoanalysis, Frances gained exposure to a variety of therapeutic models and techniques and has said that his proudest career activity was serving on the NIMH committee that in the 1980s funded the early studies on cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavioral therapy. He has argued that this research has helped many more millions of people than much of the fascinating but clinically useless biological research undertaken by NIMH in recent decades. Although Frances was trained as a psychoanalyst and taught a course on Freudian theory for a decade, he is an enthusiastic supporter of brief psychotherapy as the treatment of choice for most patients. Partly this is informed by a public health concern that everyone who needs help should have quick and easy access to treatment. Partly this comes from the experience that brief therapy is effective for most milder problems and is what most patients prefer. Partly it is partly based on the utilitarian dictum of the greatest good for the greatest number. And finally, Frances feels that brief therapy is a wonderful training device allowing acquisition of cognitive, behavioral, psychodynamic, and family systems techniques. In a 2023 interview on his career as a psychotherapist, Frances stressed the importance of differential diagnosis in psychotherapy; the importance of theoretical pluralism and technical flexibility; the healing power of the therapeutic relationship; and the value of clinical supervision and personal psychotherapy. He advised early-career therapists to treat patients across the psychiatric diagnostic spectrum, including severely ill patients; to learn the basics of psychopharmacology, including its limitations; and to gain life experience in a variety of ways, including reading literature, falling in love, and traveling, in order to become a more well-rounded therapist. Frances says that his patients were his best teachers and he is grateful to them not only for making him a better therapist but also a better person. Since 2022, he has co-hosted with psychologist Marvin Goldfried a podcast titled Talking Therapy, which covers a wide range of topics on psychotherapy and is available on Youtube. Frances wrote a 2017 book, titled, Twilight of American Sanity, in which he asserts that Trump himself does not have a mental disease, but rather that the problem lies with the American people for selecting him as U.S. President. Frances writes in the book: ""Calling Trump crazy allows us to avoid confronting the craziness in our society."" The Washington Post found the arguments made by Frances in the book stray from medical to political in nature. Publishers Weekly said the book contained factual errors and exaggeration. Kirkus Reviews said the work ""helps explain why and how the Trump presidency happened."" In August 2019, Frances stated that ""Trump is as destructive a person in this century, as Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong were in the last century. He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were. He needs to be contained, but he needs to be contained by attacking his policies, not his person."" Frances posted a follow-up to Twitter in which he asserted his comments referred to the potential future impact of climate change. In their analysis of his comments, Politifact reported that a 2011 calculation by Yale University history professor Timothy Snyder said Hitler killed over 11 million people, and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum estimated about 17 million deaths attributed to Hitler. Politifact also cited author Ian Johnson, who found Mao Zedong responsible for approximately 42.5 million fatalities in his book The Souls of China: The Return of Religion After Mao. Politifact concluded that: ""Not only does Frances' comparison exaggerate the predicted climate change death toll compared to that of the dictators, he also lays the blame for potential future deaths at Trump's feet alone, which even experts critical of Trump consider wrongheaded,"" and rated his statement as ""Pants on Fire"". In a further clarification statement to Snopes, who analyzed his assertions, Frances reiterated that he was referring to the potential future impact of climate change, stating; ""I think it is no exaggeration to worry that the policies that follow from Trump's reckless climate denial may wind up causing the death of hundreds of millions of people. Our species appears to be on a path to self-destruction, and Trump is enthusiastically leading the way.""",Wiki
Allergy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy,"Allergies, also known as allergic diseases, are various conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to typically harmless substances in the environment. These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, sneezing, coughing, a runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling. Note that food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions. Common allergens include pollen and certain foods. Metals and other substances may also cause such problems. Food, insect stings, and medications are common causes of severe reactions. Their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE), part of the body's immune system, binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Diagnosis is typically based on a person's medical history. Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases. Positive tests, however, may not necessarily mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question. Early exposure of children to potential allergens may be protective. Treatments for allergies include avoidance of known allergens and the use of medications such as steroids and antihistamines. In severe reactions, injectable adrenaline (epinephrine) is recommended. Allergen immunotherapy, which gradually exposes people to larger and larger amounts of allergen, is useful for some types of allergies such as hay fever and reactions to insect bites. Its use in food allergies is unclear. Allergies are common. In the developed world, about 20% of people are affected by allergic rhinitis, food allergy affects 10% of adults and 8% of children, and about 20% have or have had atopic dermatitis at some point in time. Depending on the country, about 1–18% of people have asthma. Anaphylaxis occurs in between 0.05–2% of people. Rates of many allergic diseases appear to be increasing. The word ""allergy"" was first used by Clemens von Pirquet in 1906. Many allergens such as dust or pollen are airborne particles. In these cases, symptoms arise in areas in contact with air, such as the eyes, nose, and lungs. For instance, allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, causes irritation of the nose, sneezing, itching, and redness of the eyes. Inhaled allergens can also lead to increased production of mucus in the lungs, shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing. Aside from these ambient allergens, allergic reactions can result from foods, insect stings, and reactions to medications like aspirin and antibiotics such as penicillin. Symptoms of food allergy include abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, itchy skin, and hives. Food allergies rarely cause respiratory (asthmatic) reactions, or rhinitis. Insect stings, food, antibiotics, and certain medicines may produce a systemic allergic response that is also called anaphylaxis; multiple organ systems can be affected, including the digestive system, the respiratory system, and the circulatory system. Depending on the severity, anaphylaxis can include skin reactions, bronchoconstriction, swelling, low blood pressure, coma, and death. This type of reaction can be triggered suddenly, or the onset can be delayed. The nature of anaphylaxis is such that the reaction can seem to be subsiding but may recur throughout a period of time. Substances that come into contact with the skin, such as latex, are also common causes of allergic reactions, known as contact dermatitis or eczema. Skin allergies frequently cause rashes, or swelling and inflammation within the skin, in what is known as a ""wheal and flare"" reaction characteristic of hives and angioedema. With insect stings, a large local reaction may occur in the form of an area of skin redness greater than 10 cm in size that can last one to two days. This reaction may also occur after immunotherapy. The way our body responds to foreign invaders on the molecular level is similar to how our allergens are treated even on the skin. Our skin forms an effective barrier to the entry of most allergens but this barrier cannot withstand everything that comes at it because at the end of the day, it is only our skin. A situation such as an insect sting can breach the barrier and inject allergen to the affected spot. When an allergen enters the epidermis or dermis, it triggers a localized allergic reaction which activates the mast cells in the skin resulting in an immediate increase in vascular permeability, leading to fluid leakage and swelling in the affected area. Mast-cell activation also stimulates a skin lesion called the wheal-and-flare reaction. This is when the release of chemicals from local nerve endings by a nerve axon reflex, causes the vasodilatations of surrounding cutaneous blood vessels, which causes redness of the surrounding skin. As a part of the allergy response, our body has developed a secondary response which in some individuals causes a more widespread and sustained edematous response. This usually occurs about 8 hours after the allergen originally comes in contact with the skin. When an allergen is ingested, a dispersed form of wheal-and-flare reaction, known as urticaria or hives will appear when the allergen enters the bloodstream and eventually reaches the skin. The way our skin reacts to different allergens gives allergists the upper hand and allows them to test for allergies by injecting a very small amount of an allergen into the skin. Even though these injections are very small and local, they still pose the risk of causing systematic anaphylaxis. Risk factors for allergies can be placed in two broad categories, namely host and environmental factors. Host factors include heredity, sex, race, and age, with heredity being by far the most significant. However, there has been a recent increase in the incidence of allergic disorders that cannot be explained by genetic factors alone. Four major environmental candidates are alterations in exposure to infectious diseases during early childhood, environmental pollution, allergen levels, and dietary changes. Dust mite allergy, also known as house dust allergy, is a sensitization and allergic reaction to the droppings of house dust mites. The allergy is common and can trigger allergic reactions such as asthma, eczema, or itching. The mite's gut contains potent digestive enzymes (notably peptidase 1) that persist in their feces and are major inducers of allergic reactions such as wheezing. The mite's exoskeleton can also contribute to allergic reactions. Unlike scabies mites or skin follicle mites, house dust mites do not burrow under the skin and are not parasitic. A wide variety of foods can cause allergic reactions, but 90% of allergic responses to foods are caused by cow's milk, soy, eggs, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish. Other food allergies, affecting less than 1 person per 10,000 population, may be considered ""rare"". The most common food allergy in the US population is a sensitivity to crustacea. Although peanut allergies are notorious for their severity, peanut allergies are not the most common food allergy in adults or children. Severe or life-threatening reactions may be triggered by other allergens and are more common when combined with asthma. Rates of allergies differ between adults and children. Children can sometimes outgrow peanut allergies. Egg allergies affect one to two percent of children but are outgrown by about two-thirds of children by the age of 5. The sensitivity is usually to proteins in the white, rather than the yolk. Milk-protein allergies—distinct from lactose intolerance—are most common in children. Approximately 60% of milk-protein reactions are immunoglobulin E–mediated, with the remaining usually attributable to inflammation of the colon. Some people are unable to tolerate milk from goats or sheep as well as from cows, and many are also unable to tolerate dairy products such as cheese. Roughly 10% of children with a milk allergy will have a reaction to beef. Lactose intolerance, a common reaction to milk, is not a form of allergy at all, but due to the absence of an enzyme in the digestive tract. Those with tree nut allergies may be allergic to one or many tree nuts, including pecans, pistachios, and walnuts. In addition, seeds, including sesame seeds and poppy seeds, contain oils in which protein is present, which may elicit an allergic reaction. Allergens can be transferred from one food to another through genetic engineering; however, genetic modification can also remove allergens. Little research has been done on the natural variation of allergen concentrations in unmodified crops. Latex can trigger an IgE-mediated cutaneous, respiratory, and systemic reaction. The prevalence of latex allergy in the general population is believed to be less than one percent. In a hospital study, 1 in 800 surgical patients (0.125 percent) reported latex sensitivity, although the sensitivity among healthcare workers is higher, between seven and ten percent. Researchers attribute this higher level to the exposure of healthcare workers to areas with significant airborne latex allergens, such as operating rooms, intensive-care units, and dental suites. These latex-rich environments may sensitize healthcare workers who regularly inhale allergenic proteins. The most prevalent response to latex is an allergic contact dermatitis, a delayed hypersensitive reaction appearing as dry, crusted lesions. This reaction usually lasts 48–96 hours. Sweating or rubbing the area under the glove aggravates the lesions, possibly leading to ulcerations. Anaphylactic reactions occur most often in sensitive patients who have been exposed to a surgeon's latex gloves during abdominal surgery, but other mucosal exposures, such as dental procedures, can also produce systemic reactions. Latex and banana sensitivity may cross-react. Furthermore, those with latex allergy may also have sensitivities to avocado, kiwifruit, and chestnut. These people often have perioral itching and local urticaria. Only occasionally have these food-induced allergies induced systemic responses. Researchers suspect that the cross-reactivity of latex with banana, avocado, kiwifruit, and chestnut occurs because latex proteins are structurally homologous with some other plant proteins. About 10% of people report that they are allergic to penicillin; however, of that 10%, 90% turn out not to be. Serious allergies only occur in about 0.03%. One of the main sources of human allergies is insects. An allergy to insects can be brought on by bites, stings, ingestion, and inhalation. Another non-food protein reaction, urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, originates after contact with poison ivy, eastern poison oak, western poison oak, or poison sumac. Urushiol, which is not itself a protein, acts as a hapten and chemically reacts with, binds to, and changes the shape of integral membrane proteins on exposed skin cells. The immune system does not recognize the affected cells as normal parts of the body, causing a T-cell-mediated immune response. Of these poisonous plants, sumac is the most virulent. The resulting dermatological response to the reaction between urushiol and membrane proteins includes redness, swelling, papules, vesicles, blisters, and streaking. Estimates vary on the population fraction that will have an immune system response. Approximately 25% of the population will have a strong allergic response to urushiol. In general, approximately 80–90% of adults will develop a rash if they are exposed to 0.0050 mg (7.7×10−5 gr) of purified urushiol, but some people are so sensitive that it takes only a molecular trace on the skin to initiate an allergic reaction. Allergic diseases are strongly familial; identical twins are likely to have the same allergic diseases about 70% of the time; the same allergy occurs about 40% of the time in non-identical twins. Allergic parents are more likely to have allergic children and those children's allergies are likely to be more severe than those in children of non-allergic parents. Some allergies, however, are not consistent along genealogies; parents who are allergic to peanuts may have children who are allergic to ragweed. The likelihood of developing allergies is inherited and related to an irregularity in the immune system, but the specific allergen is not. The risk of allergic sensitization and the development of allergies varies with age, with young children most at risk. Several studies have shown that IgE levels are highest in childhood and fall rapidly between the ages of 10 and 30 years. The peak prevalence of hay fever is highest in children and young adults and the incidence of asthma is highest in children under 10. Ethnicity may play a role in some allergies; however, racial factors have been difficult to separate from environmental influences and changes due to migration. It has been suggested that different genetic loci are responsible for asthma, to be specific, in people of European, Hispanic, Asian, and African origins. Researchers have worked to characterize genes involved in inflammation and the maintenance of mucosal integrity. The identified genes associated with allergic disease severity, progression, and development primarily function in four areas: regulating inflammatory responses (IFN-α, TLR-1, IL-13, IL-4, IL-5, HLA-G, iNOS), maintaining vascular endothelium and mucosal lining (FLG, PLAUR, CTNNA3, PDCH1, COL29A1), mediating immune cell function (PHF11, H1R, HDC, TSLP, STAT6, RERE, PPP2R3C), and influencing susceptibility to allergic sensitization (e.g., ORMDL3, CHI3L1). Multiple studies have investigated the genetic profiles of individuals with predispositions to and experiences of allergic diseases, revealing a complex polygenic architecture. Specific genetic loci, such as MIIP, CXCR4, SCML4, CYP1B1, ICOS, and LINC00824, have been directly associated with allergic disorders. Additionally, some loci show pleiotropic effects, linking them to both autoimmune and allergic conditions, including PRDM2, G3BP1, HBS1L, and POU2AF1. These genes engage in shared inflammatory pathways across various epithelial tissues—such as the skin, esophagus, vagina, and lung—highlighting common genetic factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic diseases. In atopic patients, transcriptome studies have identified IL-13-related pathways as key for eosinophilic airway inflammation and remodeling. That causes the body to experience the type of airflow restriction of allergic asthma. Expression of genes was quite variable: genes associated with inflammation were found almost exclusively in superficial airways, while genes related to airway remodeling were mainly present in endobronchial biopsy specimens. This enhanced gene profile was similar across multiple sample sizes – nasal brushing, sputum, endobronchial brushing – demonstrating the importance of eosinophilic inflammation, mast cell degranulation and group 3 innate lymphoid cells in severe adult-onset asthma. IL-13 is an immunoregulatory cytokine that is made mostly by activated T-helper 2 (Th2) cells. It is an important cytokine for many steps in B-cell maturation and differentiation, since it increases CD23 and MHC class II molecules, and aids in B-cell isotype switching to IgE. IL-13 also suppresses macrophage function by reducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The more striking thing is that IL-13 is the prime mover in allergen-induced asthma via pathways that are independent of IgE and eosinophils. Allergic diseases are caused by inappropriate immunological responses to harmless antigens driven by a TH2-mediated immune response. Many bacteria and viruses elicit a TH1-mediated immune response, which down-regulates TH2 responses. The first proposed mechanism of action of the hygiene hypothesis was that insufficient stimulation of the TH1 arm of the immune system leads to an overactive TH2 arm, which in turn leads to allergic disease. In other words, individuals living in too sterile an environment are not exposed to enough pathogens to keep the immune system busy. Since our bodies evolved to deal with a certain level of such pathogens, when they are not exposed to this level, the immune system will attack harmless antigens, and thus normally benign microbial objects—like pollen—will trigger an immune response. The hygiene hypothesis was developed to explain the observation that hay fever and eczema, both allergic diseases, were less common in children from larger families, which were, it is presumed, exposed to more infectious agents through their siblings, than in children from families with only one child. It is used to explain the increase in allergic diseases that have been seen since industrialization, and the higher incidence of allergic diseases in more developed countries. The hygiene hypothesis has now expanded to include exposure to symbiotic bacteria and parasites as important modulators of immune system development, along with infectious agents. Epidemiological data support the hygiene hypothesis. Studies have shown that various immunological and autoimmune diseases are much less common in the developing world than the industrialized world, and that immigrants to the industrialized world from the developing world increasingly develop immunological disorders in relation to the length of time since arrival in the industrialized world. Longitudinal studies in the third world demonstrate an increase in immunological disorders as a country grows more affluent and, it is presumed, cleaner. The use of antibiotics in the first year of life has been linked to asthma and other allergic diseases. The use of antibacterial cleaning products has also been associated with higher incidence of asthma, as has birth by caesarean section rather than vaginal birth. Chronic stress can aggravate allergic conditions. This has been attributed to a T helper 2 (TH2)-predominant response driven by suppression of interleukin 12 by both the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Stress management in highly susceptible individuals may improve symptoms. Allergic diseases are more common in industrialized countries than in countries that are more traditional or agricultural, and there is a higher rate of allergic disease in urban populations versus rural populations, although these differences are becoming less defined. Historically, the trees planted in urban areas were predominantly male to prevent litter from seeds and fruits, but the high ratio of male trees causes high pollen counts, a phenomenon that horticulturist Tom Ogren has called ""botanical sexism"". Alterations in exposure to microorganisms is another plausible explanation, at present, for the increase in atopic allergy. Endotoxin exposure reduces release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IFNγ, interleukin-10, and interleukin-12 from white blood cells (leukocytes) that circulate in the blood. Certain microbe-sensing proteins, known as Toll-like receptors, found on the surface of cells in the body are also thought to be involved in these processes. Parasitic worms and similar parasites are present in untreated drinking water in developing countries, and were present in the water of developed countries until the routine chlorination and purification of drinking water supplies. Recent research has shown that some common parasites, such as intestinal worms (e.g., hookworms), secrete chemicals into the gut wall (and, hence, the bloodstream) that suppress the immune system and prevent the body from attacking the parasite. This gives rise to a new slant on the hygiene hypothesis theory—that co-evolution of humans and parasites has led to an immune system that functions correctly only in the presence of the parasites. Without them, the immune system becomes unbalanced and oversensitive. In particular, research suggests that allergies may coincide with the delayed establishment of gut flora in infants. However, the research to support this theory is conflicting, with some studies performed in China and Ethiopia showing an increase in allergy in people infected with intestinal worms. Clinical trials have been initiated to test the effectiveness of certain worms in treating some allergies. It may be that the term 'parasite' could turn out to be inappropriate, and in fact a hitherto unsuspected symbiosis is at work. For more information on this topic, see Helminthic therapy. In the initial stages of allergy, a type I hypersensitivity reaction against an allergen encountered for the first time and presented by a professional antigen-presenting cell causes a response in a type of immune cell called a TH2 lymphocyte, a subset of T cells that produce a cytokine called interleukin-4 (IL-4). These TH2 cells interact with other lymphocytes called B cells, whose role is production of antibodies. Coupled with signals provided by IL-4, this interaction stimulates the B cell to begin production of a large amount of a particular type of antibody known as IgE. Secreted IgE circulates in the blood and binds to an IgE-specific receptor (a kind of Fc receptor called FcεRI) on the surface of other kinds of immune cells called mast cells and basophils, which are both involved in the acute inflammatory response. The IgE-coated cells, at this stage, are sensitized to the allergen. If later exposure to the same allergen occurs, the allergen can bind to the IgE molecules held on the surface of the mast cells or basophils. Cross-linking of the IgE and Fc receptors occurs when more than one IgE-receptor complex interacts with the same allergenic molecule and activates the sensitized cell. Activated mast cells and basophils undergo a process called degranulation, during which they release histamine and other inflammatory chemical mediators (cytokines, interleukins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins) from their granules into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects, such as vasodilation, mucous secretion, nerve stimulation, and smooth muscle contraction. This results in rhinorrhea, itchiness, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis. Depending on the individual, allergen, and mode of introduction, the symptoms can be system-wide (classical anaphylaxis) or localized to specific body systems. Asthma is localized to the respiratory system and eczema is localized to the dermis. After the chemical mediators of the acute response subside, late-phase responses can often occur. This is due to the migration of other leukocytes such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and macrophages to the initial site. The reaction is usually seen 2–24 hours after the original reaction. Cytokines from mast cells may play a role in the persistence of long-term effects. Late-phase responses seen in asthma are slightly different from those seen in other allergic responses, although they are still caused by release of mediators from eosinophils and are still dependent on activity of TH2 cells. Although allergic contact dermatitis is termed an ""allergic"" reaction (which usually refers to type I hypersensitivity), its pathophysiology involves a reaction that more correctly corresponds to a type IV hypersensitivity reaction. In type IV hypersensitivity, there is activation of certain types of T cells (CD8+) that destroy target cells on contact, as well as activated macrophages that produce hydrolytic enzymes. Effective management of allergic diseases relies on the ability to make an accurate diagnosis. Allergy testing can help confirm or rule out allergies. Correct diagnosis, counseling, and avoidance advice based on valid allergy test results reduce the incidence of symptoms and need for medications, and improve quality of life. To assess the presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, two different methods can be used: a skin prick test, or an allergy blood test. Both methods are recommended, and they have similar diagnostic value. Skin prick tests and blood tests are equally cost-effective, and health economic evidence shows that both tests were cost-effective compared with no test. Early and more accurate diagnoses save cost due to reduced consultations, referrals to secondary care, misdiagnosis, and emergency admissions. Allergy undergoes dynamic changes over time. Regular allergy testing of relevant allergens provides information on if and how patient management can be changed to improve health and quality of life. Annual testing is often the practice for determining whether allergy to milk, egg, soy, and wheat have been outgrown, and the testing interval is extended to 2–3 years for allergy to peanut, tree nuts, fish, and crustacean shellfish. Results of follow-up testing can guide decision-making regarding whether and when it is safe to introduce or re-introduce allergenic food into the diet. Skin testing is also known as ""puncture testing"" and ""prick testing"" due to the series of tiny punctures or pricks made into the patient's skin. Tiny amounts of suspected allergens and/or their extracts (e.g., pollen, grass, mite proteins, peanut extract) are introduced to sites on the skin marked with pen or dye (the ink/dye should be carefully selected, lest it cause an allergic response itself). A negative and positive control are also included for comparison (eg, negative is saline or glycerin; positive is histamine). A small plastic or metal device is used to puncture or prick the skin. Sometimes, the allergens are injected ""intradermally"" into the patient's skin, with a needle and syringe. Common areas for testing include the inside forearm and the back. If the patient is allergic to the substance, then a visible inflammatory reaction will usually occur within 30 minutes. This response will range from slight reddening of the skin to a full-blown hive (called ""wheal and flare"") in more sensitive patients similar to a mosquito bite. Interpretation of the results of the skin prick test is normally done by allergists on a scale of severity, with +/− meaning borderline reactivity, and 4+ being a large reaction. Increasingly, allergists are measuring and recording the diameter of the wheal and flare reaction. Interpretation by well-trained allergists is often guided by relevant literature. In general, a positive response is interpreted when the wheal of an antigen is ≥3mm larger than the wheal of the negative control (eg, saline or glycerin). Some patients may believe they have determined their own allergic sensitivity from observation, but a skin test has been shown to be much better than patient observation to detect allergy. If a serious life-threatening anaphylactic reaction has brought a patient in for evaluation, some allergists will prefer an initial blood test prior to performing the skin prick test. Skin tests may not be an option if the patient has widespread skin disease or has taken antihistamines in the last several days. Patch testing is a method used to determine if a specific substance causes allergic inflammation of the skin. It tests for delayed reactions. It is used to help ascertain the cause of skin contact allergy or contact dermatitis. Adhesive patches, usually treated with several common allergic chemicals or skin sensitizers, are applied to the back. The skin is then examined for possible local reactions at least twice, usually at 48 hours after application of the patch, and again two or three days later. An allergy blood test is quick and simple and can be ordered by a licensed health care provider (e.g., an allergy specialist) or general practitioner. Unlike skin-prick testing, a blood test can be performed irrespective of age, skin condition, medication, symptom, disease activity, and pregnancy. Adults and children of any age can get an allergy blood test. For babies and very young children, a single needle stick for allergy blood testing is often gentler than several skin pricks. An allergy blood test is available through most laboratories. A sample of the patient's blood is sent to a laboratory for analysis, and the results are sent back a few days later. Multiple allergens can be detected with a single blood sample. Allergy blood tests are very safe since the person is not exposed to any allergens during the testing procedure. After the onset of anaphylaxis or a severe allergic reaction, guidelines recommend emergency departments obtain a time-sensitive blood test to determine blood tryptase levels and assess for mast cell activation. The test measures the concentration of specific IgE antibodies in the blood. Quantitative IgE test results increase the possibility of ranking how different substances may affect symptoms. A rule of thumb is that the higher the IgE antibody value, the greater the likelihood of symptoms. Allergens found at low levels that today do not result in symptoms cannot help predict future symptom development. The quantitative allergy blood result can help determine what a patient is allergic to, help predict and follow the disease development, estimate the risk of a severe reaction, and explain cross-reactivity. A low total IgE level is not adequate to rule out sensitization to commonly inhaled allergens. Statistical methods, such as ROC curves, predictive value calculations, and likelihood ratios have been used to examine the relationship of various testing methods to each other. These methods have shown that patients with a high total IgE have a high probability of allergic sensitization, but further investigation with allergy tests for specific IgE antibodies for a carefully chosen of allergens is often warranted. Laboratory methods to measure specific IgE antibodies for allergy testing include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, or EIA), radioallergosorbent test (RAST), fluorescent enzyme immunoassay (FEIA), and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). Challenge testing: Challenge testing is when tiny amounts of a suspected allergen are introduced to the body orally, through inhalation, or via other routes. Except for testing food and medication allergies, challenges are rarely performed. When this type of testing is chosen, it must be closely supervised by an allergist. Elimination/challenge tests: This testing method is used most often with foods or medicines. A patient with a suspected allergen is instructed to modify his diet to totally avoid that allergen for a set time. If the patient experiences significant improvement, he may then be ""challenged"" by reintroducing the allergen, to see if symptoms are reproduced. Unreliable tests: There are other types of allergy testing methods that are unreliable, including applied kinesiology (allergy testing through muscle relaxation), cytotoxicity testing, urine autoinjection, skin titration (Rinkel method), and provocative and neutralization (subcutaneous) testing or sublingual provocation. Before a diagnosis of allergic disease can be confirmed, other plausible causes of the presenting symptoms must be considered. Vasomotor rhinitis, for example, is one of many illnesses that share symptoms with allergic rhinitis, underscoring the need for professional differential diagnosis. Once a diagnosis of asthma, rhinitis, anaphylaxis, or other allergic disease has been made, there are several methods for discovering the causative agent of that allergy. Giving peanut products early in childhood may decrease the risk of allergies, and only breastfeeding during at least the first few months of life may decrease the risk of allergic dermatitis. There is little evidence that a mother's diet during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects the risk of allergies, although there has been some research to show that irregular cow's milk exposure might increase the risk of cow's milk allergy. There is some evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful, and that early exposure to potential al",Wiki
Allied_health_professions,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_health_professions,"Allied health professions (AHPs) are a category of health professionals that provide a range of diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services in connection with health care. While there is no international standard for defining the diversity of allied health professions, they are typically considered those which are distinct from the fields of medicine, nursing and dentistry. In providing care to patients with certain illnesses, AHPs may work in the public or private sector, in hospitals or in other types of facilities, and often in clinical collaboration with other providers having complementary scopes of practice. Allied health professions are usually of smaller size proportional to physicians and nurses. It has been estimated that approximately 30% of the total health workforce worldwide are AHPs. In most jurisdictions, AHPs are subject to health professional requisites including minimum standards for education, regulation and licensing. They must work based on scientific principles and within an evidence based practice model. They may sometimes be considered to perform the role of mid-level practitioners, when having an advanced education and training to diagnose and treat patients, but not the certification of a physician. Allied health professionals are different from alternative medicine practitioners, also sometimes called natural healers, who work outside the conventions of modern biomedicine. The organization of International Chief Health Professions Officers (ICHPO) developed a widely-used definition of the allied health professions: Allied Health Professions are a distinct group of health professionals who apply their expertise to prevent disease transmission, diagnose, treat and rehabilitate people of all ages and all specialties. Together with a range of technical and support staff they may deliver direct patient care, rehabilitation, treatment, diagnostics and health improvement interventions to restore and maintain optimal physical, sensory, psychological, cognitive and social functions. The allied health professions represent a large cluster of health and care service providers, which usually require specific training and/or certification, but which are distinct from the medicine, nursing and dentistry professions. There is a large demand for allied health professionals, especially in rural and medically underserved areas. AHPs are generally considered distinct from other healthcare service providers on the basis of several factors. These factors may include AHPs offering services in ways which support treatments provided by other healthcare professionals (working either in independent autonomous practice or under direct supervision), or by offering services which other healthcare professionals require but do not provide themselves (for example in the use of medical technologies). The precise titles, roles and requisites of AHPs vary considerably from country to country. For the United States, a generic definition is in the Public Health Service Act, including those with ""training, in a science relating to health care, [and] who shares in the responsibility for the delivery of health care services or related services"" (other than a registered nurse or physician assistant). In South Africa, AHPs are identified and regulated through the Health Professions Council of South Africa (e.g., clinical technologists, dental therapists) or through the Allied Health Professions Council (e.g., massage therapists, chiropractors). Depending on the country and local health care system, the professions that are considered AHPs vary. For example, in some contexts optometrists are not considered AHPs, as the profession has a longer history of primary care practice independent of modern medicine, whereas in others optometrists are identified as falling under the AHP umbrella. Similarly, in some health care jurisdictions physiotherapists are not considered AHPs, as they tend to have more autonomy in private practice without the need for medical referral, whereas in other jurisdictions physiotherapists are identified and regulated as AHPs. A limited subset of the following professional areas may be represented, and may be regulated: Some allied health professions are more specialized, and so must adhere to national training and education standards and their professional scope of practice. Often they must prove their skills through degrees, diplomas, certified credentials, and continuing education. Other allied health professions require no special training or credentials and are trained for their work by their employer through on-the-job training (which would then exclude them from consideration as an allied health profession in a country like Australia). Many allied health jobs are considered career ladder jobs because of the opportunities for advancement within specific fields. Allied health professions can include the use of many skills. Depending on the profession, these may include basic life support; medical terminology, acronyms and spelling; basics of medical law and ethics; understanding of human relations; interpersonal communication skills; counseling skills; computer literacy; ability to document healthcare information; interviewing skills; and proficiency in word processing; database management and electronic dictation. The explosion of scientific knowledge that followed World War II brought increasingly sophisticated and complex medical diagnostic and treatment procedures. Increasing public demand for medical services combined with higher health care costs provoked a trend toward expansion of service delivery from treating patients in hospitals to widespread provision of care in physician's private and group practices, ambulatory medical and emergency clinics, and mobile clinics and community-based care.[citation needed] Changes in the health industry and emphasis on cost-efficient solutions to health care delivery will continue to encourage expansion of the allied health workforce. The World Health Organization estimates there is currently a worldwide shortage of about 2 million allied health professionals (considering all health workers aside from medical and nursing personnel) needed in order to meet global health goals. In recognition of the growth of the number and diversity of allied health professionals in recent years, the 2008 version of the International Standard Classification of Occupations increased the number of groups dedicated to allied health professions. Depending on the presumed skill level, they may either be identified as ""health professionals"" or ""health associate professionals"". For example, new categories have been created for delineating ""paramedical practitioners""—grouping professions such as clinical officers, clinical associates, physician assistants, Feldshers, and assistant medical officers—as well as for community health workers; dietitians and nutritionists; audiologists and speech therapists; and others. In developing countries, many national human resources for health strategic plans and international development initiatives are focusing on scaling up training of allied health professions, such as HIV/AIDS counsellors, clinical officers and community health workers, in providing essential preventive and treatment services in ambulatory and community-based care settings. With growing demand for ambulatory health care, researchers expect to witness a heavier demand for professions that are employed outside of hospital settings — including allied health. In India, the National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Professions identifies and sets quality standards for 56 professions in diagnostics, therapeutics, community health, and biomedical technology (e.g., physiotherapists, radiologists). In the United Kingdom there are 14 distinct professions who are considered allied health professionals; in combination they account for about 6% of the NHS workforce. In 2013 the annual expenditure on services provided by allied health professionals amounted to around £2 billion, although there is a lack of evidence around the extent to which these services improve the quality of care. In the United States, the Association of Schools of Allied Health Professionals uses wording from the Public Health Service Act to list those who are considered to be allied health professionals. Professionals who are excluded under the Act from the list of AHPs, although they may possess degrees or diplomas in health sciences, include the following: Projections in the United States and many other countries have shown an expected long-term shortage of qualified workers to fill many allied health positions. This is primarily due to expansion of the health industry due to demographic changes (a growing and aging population), large numbers of health workers nearing retirement, the industry's need to be cost efficient, and a lack of sufficient investment in training programs to keep pace with these trends. Studies have also pointed to the need for increased diversity in the allied health workforce to realize a culturally competent health system. Workforce and health care experts anticipate that health services will increasingly be delivered via ambulatory and nursing care settings rather than in hospitals. According to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the health care industry consists of four main sub-sectors, divided by the types of services provided at each facility: In the US, a larger proportion of the allied health care workforce is already employed in ambulatory settings. In California, nearly half (49.4 percent) of the allied health workforce is employed in ambulatory health care settings, compared with 28.7 percent and 21.9 percent employed in hospital and nursing care, respectively. One source reported allied health professionals making up 60 percent of the total US health workforce. Advancements in medical technology also allow for more services that formerly required expensive hospital stays to be delivered via ambulatory care. For example, in California, research has predicted the total consumption of hospital days per person will decline from 4 days in 2010 to 3.2 days in 2020 to 2.5 days in 2030. In contrast, the number of ambulatory visits per person will increase from 3.2 visits per person in 2010 to 3.6 visits per person in 2020 to 4.2 visits in 2030.",Wiki
American_Dental_Association,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dental_Association,"ADPAC Education Fund, ADA Business Enterprises Inc, The American Dental Association (ADA) is an American professional association established in 1859 which has more than 159,000 members. The ADA is the world's largest and oldest national dental association. The organization lobbies on behalf of the American dental profession and provides dental accreditation. The ADA publishes the Journal of the American Dental Association and JADA Foundational Science. As part of its lobbying efforts, the ADA has sought to restrict non-dentists (such as dental hygienists and dental therapists) from providing basic dental care. The organization has played an important role in blocking the inclusion of dental coverage in Medicare. The ADA has expressed opposition to the opening of new dental schools or to increasing the number of dentists in the United States, even as the United States trains almost half as many dental students (relative to population) in the 2000s as it did in the 1980s. The American Dental Association was founded August 3, 1859, at Niagara Falls, New York, by twenty-six dentists who represented various dental societies in the United States. It is the largest and oldest national dental association in the world. The association has more than 400 employees at its headquarters in Chicago and its office in Washington, D.C. The Paffenbarger Research Center (PRC), located on the campus of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, an agency of the American Dental Association Foundation (ADAF) and a Department of the Division of Science. PRC scientists conduct basic and applied studies in clinical research, dental chemistry, polymer chemistry and cariology, and are used by of the ADA. Historically, the ADA has discriminated against minority dentists and sough to exclude them from its affiliates. This discrimination in part prompted the creation of the National Dental Association. In 2010, the ADA apologized for its history of racial discrimination. After a Reader's Digest investigation revealed that dentists provided drastically different evaluations of the same patients and suggested drastically different treatments, ADA President Leslie Seldin said, ""Dentistry is an art based on scientific knowledge, and what's most important to all of us is that we each use our professional judgment to design what we believe is the best solution for the patient."" The ADA established rigorous guidelines for testing and advertising of dental products, and the first ADA Seal of Acceptance was awarded in 1931. Today, about 350 manufacturers participate in the voluntary program and more than 1,300 products have received the Seal of Acceptance. Product manufacturers are charged $14,500 for each product the ADA evaluates. For products that are approved, manufacturers pay an annual fee of $3,500. According to the ADA, it does not make a profit from the program. The Board of Trustees, the administrative body of the association, is composed of the president, the president-elect, two vice presidents and 17 trustees from each of the 17 trustee districts in the United States. The treasurer and executive director serve as ex officio members. The House of Delegates, the legislative body of the association, is composed of 460 delegates representing 53 constituent societies, five federal dental services and the American Student Dental Association. The house meets once a year during the association's annual session. The association's 11 councils serve as policy recommending agencies. Each council is assigned to study issues relating to its special area of interest and to make recommendations on those matters to the Board of Trustees and the House of Delegates. The association's official publication is the Journal of the American Dental Association. Other publications include the ADA News and the ADA Guide to Dental Therapeutics. The Commission on Dental Accreditation, which operates under the auspices of the ADA, is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as the national accrediting body for dental, advanced dental and allied dental education programs in the United States. It is also recognized by 47 individual states. The ADA formally recognizes nine specialty areas of dental practice: dental public health, endodontics, oral and maxillofacial pathology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics, pediatric dentistry, periodontics, prosthodontics, and oral and maxillofacial radiology. The ADA Foundation is the charitable arm of the association. The ADA opposes the opening of new dental schools and increases in the number of dental students. The organization has questioned federal data showing a dentist shortage in the United States. In the 1980s, dental schools graduated nearly twice as many students relative to total population as they did in the 2000s. The ADA has a history of trying to restrict the kind of care that dental hygienists and dental therapists are allowed to provide. In many states, dental hygienists are required to be closely supervised by dentists when they provide care. In 1991, the Director of the ADA's Council on Dental Practice expressed opposition to permit dental hygienists to work unsupervised, arguing that this would harm patients and that dental hygienists ""need the dentists to review their work."" In 2017, the Federal Trade Commission proposed to create a category of mid-level practitioners (dental therapists) to provide some routine dental services, which ""could benefit consumers by increasing choice, competition, and access to care, especially for the underserved."" The ADA lobbied against the proposal, arguing that the government should rather give more funding to dentists than allow ""lesser trained"" therapists to provide dental services. The ADA spent millions of dollars to block legislative proposals in various states to permit dental therapists to provide services. The ADA's own research has shown that when dentists work with dental therapists, the rate of untreated caries was lower than in dentist-only teams. The ADA has a long history of advocating against dental coverage under national health insurance plans. In 1965, the ADA lobbied against the inclusion of dental coverage in the original Medicare program. In 2021, the ADA launched a well-funded lobbying effort against proposal to provide dental insurance coverage for all Medicare recipients. The ADA stands in contrast to the National Dental Association, which has advocated for universal dental coverage for Medicare recipients. In 2021, ADA president Cesar R. Sabates credited the exclusion of Medicare dental coverage in the Build Back Better Plan to the ADA's advocacy. Critics of the ADA argue that the organization undermines competition in dental services and makes dental care in the United States less affordable. The ADA has also been described as an ""old boys club"" where licensed dentists, 70% of whom are male, restrict the kinds of services that dental hygienists (more than 95% of whom are female) can provide.",Wiki
American_Osteopathic_Board_of_Pathology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Osteopathic_Board_of_Pathology,"The American Osteopathic Board of Pathology (AOBPa) is an organization that provides board certification to qualified Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) who specialize in the diagnosis and characterization of disease in patients following thorough examination of biopsies and/or bodily fluids (pathologists). The board is one 18 medical specialty certifying boards of the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists approved by the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), and was established in 1974. As of December 2011, 55 osteopathic pathologists held active certification with the AOBPa. In addition to fellows of the American Board of Pathology, board certified osteopathic pathologists are eligible for admission to the College of American Pathologists and to the American Society for Mohs Surgery. To become board certified in pathology, candidates must have completed an AOA-approved residency in pathology. Additionally, candidates must have successfully completed the required clinical, oral, and written exams. Since 1995, board certified osteopathic pathologists must renew their certification every ten years to avoid expiration of their board certification status. The AOBPa oversees examination of candidates in the areas of anatomic pathology, dermatopathology, forensic pathology, and laboratory medicine. Additionally, the AOBPa provides a Certificate of Added Qualifications in dermatopathology and a Certificate of Special Qualifications in forensic pathology.",Wiki
American_Society_for_Clinical_Pathology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_for_Clinical_Pathology,"The American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), formerly known as the American Society of Clinical Pathologists, is a professional association based in Chicago, Illinois, encompassing 130,000 pathologists and laboratory professionals. Founded in 1922, the ASCP provides programs in education, certification and advocacy on behalf of patients, pathologists and lab professionals. In addition, the ASCP publishes numerous textbooks, newsletters and other manuals, and publishes two industry journals: American Journal of Clinical Pathology (AJCP) and LabMedicine. The current CEO since 2010 is Ervin Blair Holladay, Ph.D., MASCP, SCT(ASCP)CM who collects an annual salary of US$1 million. In February 2006, ASCP acquired the cytology product line of the Midwest Institute for Medical Education (MIME). At the time, it was the only national cytology proficiency testing provider. In 2009, ASCP acquired the medical technologist led National Credentialing Agency for Laboratory Personnel (NCA). The baccalaureate-level certification designations Medical Technologist (MT) and Clinical Laboratory Scientist (CLS) were replaced by Medical Laboratory Scientist, MLS(ASCP)CM. The BOC Board of Governors will be composed of five ASCP Fellows (pathologists), five ASCP laboratory professionals, four representatives of ASCLS, two representatives of the Association of Genetic Technologists, eight representatives from the eight participating societies respectively, and one public representative. The acquisition was criticized by AMT as doing little to further the standing of laboratory professionals. In 2021, ASCP acquired the Clinical Laboratory Management Association (CMLA). CMLA had advocated against laboratory personnel licensure as an unnecessary cost. [MT ASCP] is becoming increasingly important and will serve in to place trained laboratory technicians in a more secure competition with those whose training has been more superficial. The ASCP Board of Registry (BOR) was established in 1928 as the ""Registration Bureau for Technicians"" as the first certification agency for clinical laboratory personnel in the US. ASCP was the first professional medical organization to set standards for laboratory professionals, which initially only required a recommendation from a member. Those recommended were subsequently registered with ASCP, hence name the Board of Registry. In 1931, there were two classifications for registrants: Laboratory Technician (L.T.) and Medical Technologist (M.T.). The L.T. designation was granted to all technicians who met the minimum requirements without the examination. The M.T. designations was issued to applicants who met rigid requirement of the Board and were individually elected at each annual meeting. The first certification was issued in 1930 to Paul H. Adams of Fort Wayne, Indiana. In 1933, ASCP began to assess individuals for academic and clinical prerequisites, and those who passed a board examination were granted certification. The initial certifications included a written and practical component. In 1935 the title Medical Technologist (MT) automatically to those certified Laboratory Technicians with college degrees. In 1936, the ""Laboratory Technician"" designation is retired and subsequent registrants are designated Medical Technologists and the academic requirements were raised to two years of college. In 1938, the Registry was renamed from the Registry of Technicians to the Registry of Medical Technologists. As Canadian pathology society did not have a registry, interested Canadian medical technologists sat for the Amereican ASCP MT certification instead. In 1939, the BOR publishes the first book outlining the educational curriculum for medical technologists entitled Curriculum for Schools of Medical Technology. In 1940, as other organizations began using the same designations, the initials MT(ASCP) were used. In 1944, due to travel wartime restrictions from World War II, the practical component of the certification was discontinued. In 1948, the written essay portion of the certification was deemed too cumbersome to assess, and the certification was switched to a multiple choice and true-false assessment that could be graded on a machine and provide exam statistics. In 1949, the BOR changed the exam format to a 200 multiple choice question exam as the multiple choice questions were found to be a more reliable indicator than true-false questions. In 1949, the BOR also created the Board of Schools (BOS) for registering schools. In 1958, BoR and ASMT assisted with the reclassification of medical technologists, putting them at the professional level in the Civil Service and allowing medical technologists to gain commission status in the US military. In 1962, the BoR began requiring 3 years of college for the MT certification. In 1972, the BoR began requiring a Bachelor's degree for the MT certification. There were 100,000 certificates issued by 1975, 200,000 by 1980, 300,000 by 1991, 400,000 by 2005, and 500,000 by 2014. In July 1991, BOR administered their first Computer adaptive tests the ASCP headquarters for the Medical Technologist (MT), Medical Laboratory Technician (MLT), Phlebotomy Technician (PBT), Cytotechnologist (CT), and Histologic Technician (HT) certification examinations. In 1994, BOR changed their examination format to Computerized adaptive testing (CAT). In 2004, the BOR implemented the Certification Maintenance Program (CMP) requiring continuing education every three years to remain certified. Through its efforts to standardize the training of medical technologists, the Registry has come to be recognized by the leading medical and hospital groups as the only authoritative qualifying body for this field...The Registry, therefore, while purely voluntary and non-coercive, is universally accepted as the authoritative organization for qualifying the medical technologists in the United States. In the 1960s, the BOR Code of Ethics and Standards of Conduct placed professional limitations on medical technologists requiring ""A medical technologist will work at all times under the direction or supervision of a pathologist or other duly qualified and licensed doctor of medicine, such qualifications being determined on the basis of accepted medical ethics"" and that ""A medical technologist will not act as owner, co-owner, advisor or employee, or by means of any subterfuge, participate in an arrangement whereby an individual not regularly licensed to practice medicine is enabled to own or operate a laboratory of clinical pathology."" In 1965, Janet Higgins, an ASCP certified medical technologist, was removed from the Board of Registry (BOR) because she was employed at a New Jersey laboratory where the director was a state-licensed bio-analytical laboratory director, but not a physician. Though New Jersey has never required the certification for employment, the technologist successfully sued ASCP under monopolistic restraint of trade to be reinstated to the registry with the Supreme Court of New Jersey finding that the ""professional status conferred on plaintiff by her certificate is an interest of sufficient substance to warrant the protection of the court."" The lawsuit, and the focus on pathologists over medical technologists spurred other medical technologist societies, such as the American Society for Medical Technology (ASMT) to promote the creation of their own certifying boards. The BOR bylaws were updated following the transition from the American Society of Clinical Pathologists to American Society for Clinical Pathology. In 1949, ASCP stablished the Board of Schools (BOS) for accrediting medical technologist programs and published the Essentials of an Acceptable MT School. In 1973, following antitrust litigation by the United States Department of Education, the ASCP Board of Schools became the independent National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences. In 2022 ASCP received a multi-year grant over $1M to promote the CDC OneLab initiative, a network of laboratory professionals and testers to support rapid, large-scale responses to public health emergencies. ASCP offers a number of certifications. International certifications taken outside the United States are denoted as ASCPi. As of 2022, there were 580,000 ASCP and 20,800 ASCPi certificates awarded. In 2023, the number of MLS ASCPi applicants exceeded the number of MLS ASCP applicants. Outside the US, the Philippines is largest ASCPi market with a third of eligible Filipino graduates applying for the MLS (ASCPi) certification annually. The credential is not required for practice in the Philippines, but is appealing for its international work eligibility, primarily immigration to the United States.

Amino_acid,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid,"Amino acids are organic compounds that contain both amino and carboxylic acid functional groups. Although over 500 amino acids exist in nature, by far the most important are the 22 α-amino acids incorporated into proteins. Only these 22 appear in the genetic code of life. Amino acids can be classified according to the locations of the core structural functional groups (alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-) amino acids, etc.); other categories relate to polarity, ionization, and side-chain group type (aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic, polar, etc.). In the form of proteins, amino-acid residues form the second-largest component (water being the largest) of human muscles and other tissues. Beyond their role as residues in proteins, amino acids participate in a number of processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis. It is thought that they played a key role in enabling life on Earth and its emergence. Amino acids are formally named by the IUPAC-IUBMB Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature in terms of the fictitious ""neutral"" structure shown in the illustration. For example, the systematic name of alanine is 2-aminopropanoic acid, based on the formula CH3−CH(NH2)−COOH. The Commission justified this approach as follows: The systematic names and formulas given refer to hypothetical forms in which amino groups are unprotonated and carboxyl groups are undissociated. This convention is useful to avoid various nomenclatural problems but should not be taken to imply that these structures represent an appreciable fraction of the amino-acid molecules. The first few amino acids were discovered in the early 1800s. In 1806, French chemists Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin and Pierre Jean Robiquet isolated a compound from asparagus that was subsequently named asparagine, the first amino acid to be discovered. Cystine was discovered in 1810, although its monomer, cysteine, remained undiscovered until 1884.[a] Glycine and leucine were discovered in 1820. The last of the 20 common amino acids to be discovered was threonine in 1935 by William Cumming Rose, who also determined the essential amino acids and established the minimum daily requirements of all amino acids for optimal growth. The unity of the chemical category was recognized by Wurtz in 1865, but he gave no particular name to it. The first use of the term ""amino acid"" in the English language dates from 1898, while the German term, Aminosäure, was used earlier. Proteins were found to yield amino acids after enzymatic digestion or acid hydrolysis. In 1902, Emil Fischer and Franz Hofmeister independently proposed that proteins are formed from many amino acids, whereby bonds are formed between the amino group of one amino acid with the carboxyl group of another, resulting in a linear structure that Fischer termed ""peptide"". 2-, alpha-, or α-amino acids have the generic formula H2NCHRCOOH in most cases,[b] where R is an organic substituent known as a ""side chain"". Of the many hundreds of described amino acids, 22 are proteinogenic (""protein-building""). It is these 22 compounds that combine to give a vast array of peptides and proteins assembled by ribosomes. Non-proteinogenic or modified amino acids may arise from post-translational modification or during nonribosomal peptide synthesis. The carbon atom next to the carboxyl group is called the α–carbon. In proteinogenic amino acids, it bears the amine and the R group or side chain specific to each amino acid, as well as a hydrogen atom. With the exception of glycine, for which the side chain is also a hydrogen atom, the α–carbon is stereogenic. All chiral proteogenic amino acids have the L configuration. They are ""left-handed"" enantiomers, which refers to the stereoisomers of the alpha carbon. A few D-amino acids (""right-handed"") have been found in nature, e.g., in bacterial envelopes, as a neuromodulator (D-serine), and in some antibiotics. Rarely, D-amino acid residues are found in proteins, and are converted from the L-amino acid as a post-translational modification.[c] Five amino acids possess a charge at neutral pH. Often these side chains appear at the surfaces on proteins to enable their solubility in water, and side chains with opposite charges form important electrostatic contacts called salt bridges that maintain structures within a single protein or between interfacing proteins. Many proteins bind metal into their structures specifically, and these interactions are commonly mediated by charged side chains such as aspartate, glutamate and histidine. Under certain conditions, each ion-forming group can be charged, forming double salts. The two negatively charged amino acids at neutral pH are aspartate (Asp, D) and glutamate (Glu, E). The anionic carboxylate groups behave as Brønsted bases in most circumstances. Enzymes in very low pH environments, like the aspartic protease pepsin in mammalian stomachs, may have catalytic aspartate or glutamate residues that act as Brønsted acids. There are three amino acids with side chains that are cations at neutral pH: arginine (Arg, R), lysine (Lys, K) and histidine (His, H). Arginine has a charged guanidino group and lysine a charged alkyl amino group, and are fully protonated at pH 7. Histidine's imidazole group has a pKa of 6.0, and is only around 10% protonated at neutral pH. Because histidine is easily found in its basic and conjugate acid forms it often participates in catalytic proton transfers in enzyme reactions. The polar, uncharged amino acids serine (Ser, S), threonine (Thr, T), asparagine (Asn, N) and glutamine (Gln, Q) readily form hydrogen bonds with water and other amino acids. They do not ionize in normal conditions, a prominent exception being the catalytic serine in serine proteases. This is an example of severe perturbation, and is not characteristic of serine residues in general. Threonine has two chiral centers, not only the L (2S) chiral center at the α-carbon shared by all amino acids apart from achiral glycine, but also (3R) at the β-carbon. The full stereochemical specification is (2S,3R)-L-threonine. Nonpolar amino acid interactions are the primary driving force behind the processes that fold proteins into their functional three dimensional structures. None of these amino acids' side chains ionize easily, and therefore do not have pKas, with the exception of tyrosine (Tyr, Y). The hydroxyl of tyrosine can deprotonate at high pH forming the negatively charged phenolate. Because of this one could place tyrosine into the polar, uncharged amino acid category, but its very low solubility in water matches the characteristics of hydrophobic amino acids well. Several side chains are not described well by the charged, polar and hydrophobic categories. Glycine (Gly, G) could be considered a polar amino acid since its small size means that its solubility is largely determined by the amino and carboxylate groups. However, the lack of any side chain provides glycine with a unique flexibility among amino acids with large ramifications to protein folding. Cysteine (Cys, C) can also form hydrogen bonds readily, which would place it in the polar amino acid category, though it can often be found in protein structures forming covalent bonds, called disulphide bonds, with other cysteines. These bonds influence the folding and stability of proteins, and are essential in the formation of antibodies. Proline (Pro, P) has an alkyl side chain and could be considered hydrophobic, but because the side chain joins back onto the alpha amino group it becomes particularly inflexible when incorporated into proteins. Similar to glycine this influences protein structure in a way unique among amino acids. Selenocysteine (Sec, U) is a rare amino acid not directly encoded by DNA, but is incorporated into proteins via the ribosome. Selenocysteine has a lower redox potential compared to the similar cysteine, and participates in several unique enzymatic reactions. Pyrrolysine (Pyl, O) is another amino acid not encoded in DNA, but synthesized into protein by ribosomes. It is found in archaeal species where it participates in the catalytic activity of several methyltransferases. Amino acids with the structure NH+3−CXY−CXY−CO−2, such as β-alanine, a component of carnosine and a few other peptides, are β-amino acids. Ones with the structure NH+3−CXY−CXY−CXY−CO−2 are γ-amino acids, and so on, where X and Y are two substituents (one of which is normally H). The common natural forms of amino acids have a zwitterionic structure, with −NH+3 (−NH+2− in the case of proline) and −CO−2 functional groups attached to the same C atom, and are thus α-amino acids, and are the only ones found in proteins during translation in the ribosome. In aqueous solution at pH close to neutrality, amino acids exist as zwitterions, i.e. as dipolar ions with both NH+3 and CO−2 in charged states, so the overall structure is NH+3−CHR−CO−2. At physiological pH the so-called ""neutral forms"" −NH2−CHR−CO2H are not present to any measurable degree. Although the two charges in the zwitterion structure add up to zero it is misleading to call a species with a net charge of zero ""uncharged"". In strongly acidic conditions (pH below 3), the carboxylate group becomes protonated and the structure becomes an ammonio carboxylic acid, NH+3−CHR−CO2H. This is relevant for enzymes like pepsin that are active in acidic environments such as the mammalian stomach and lysosomes, but does not significantly apply to intracellular enzymes. In highly basic conditions (pH greater than 10, not normally seen in physiological conditions), the ammonio group is deprotonated to give NH2−CHR−CO−2. Although various definitions of acids and bases are used in chemistry, the only one that is useful for chemistry in aqueous solution is that of Brønsted: an acid is a species that can donate a proton to another species, and a base is one that can accept a proton. This criterion is used to label the groups in the above illustration. The carboxylate side chains of aspartate and glutamate residues are the principal Brønsted bases in proteins. Likewise, lysine, tyrosine and cysteine will typically act as a Brønsted acid. Histidine under these conditions can act both as a Brønsted acid and a base. For amino acids with uncharged side-chains the zwitterion predominates at pH values between the two pKa values, but coexists in equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the midpoint between the two pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero. This pH is known as the isoelectric point pI, so pI = ⁠1/2⁠(pKa1 + pKa2). For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the side chain is involved. Thus for aspartate or glutamate with negative side chains, the terminal amino group is essentially entirely in the charged form −NH+3, but this positive charge needs to be balanced by the state with just one C-terminal carboxylate group is negatively charged. This occurs halfway between the two carboxylate pKa values: pI = ⁠1/2⁠(pKa1 + pKa(R)), where pKa(R) is the side chain pKa. Similar considerations apply to other amino acids with ionizable side-chains, including not only glutamate (similar to aspartate), but also cysteine, histidine, lysine, tyrosine and arginine with positive side chains. Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point, and some amino acids (in particular, with nonpolar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point. The 20 canonical amino acids can be classified according to their properties. Important factors are charge, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, size, and functional groups. These properties influence protein structure and protein–protein interactions. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried in the middle of the protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. (In biochemistry, a residue refers to a specific monomer within the polymeric chain of a polysaccharide, protein or nucleic acid.) The integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them in the lipid bilayer. Some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that sticks to the membrane. In a similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich in negatively charged amino acids such as glutamate and aspartate, while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich in positively charged amino acids like lysine and arginine. For example, lysine and arginine are present in large amounts in the low-complexity regions of nucleic-acid binding proteins. There are various hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues. Some amino acids have special properties. Cysteine can form covalent disulfide bonds to other cysteine residues. Proline forms a cycle to the polypeptide backbone, and glycine is more flexible than other amino acids. Glycine and proline are strongly present within low complexity regions of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins, whereas the opposite is the case with cysteine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, which are highly reactive, or complex, or hydrophobic. Many proteins undergo a range of posttranslational modifications, whereby additional chemical groups are attached to the amino acid residue side chains sometimes producing lipoproteins (that are hydrophobic), or glycoproteins (that are hydrophilic) allowing the protein to attach temporarily to a membrane. For example, a signaling protein can attach and then detach from a cell membrane, because it contains cysteine residues that can have the fatty acid palmitic acid added to them and subsequently removed. Although one-letter symbols are included in the table, IUPAC–IUBMB recommend that ""Use of the one-letter symbols should be restricted to the comparison of long sequences"". The one-letter notation was chosen by IUPAC-IUB based on the following rules: Two additional amino acids are in some species coded for by codons that are usually interpreted as stop codons: In addition to the specific amino acid codes, placeholders are used in cases where chemical or crystallographic analysis of a peptide or protein cannot conclusively determine the identity of a residue. They are also used to summarize conserved protein sequence motifs. The use of single letters to indicate sets of similar residues is similar to the use of abbreviation codes for degenerate bases. Unk is sometimes used instead of Xaa, but is less standard. Ter or * (from termination) is used in notation for mutations in proteins when a stop codon occurs. It corresponds to no amino acid at all. In addition, many nonstandard amino acids have a specific code. For example, several peptide drugs, such as Bortezomib and MG132, are artificially synthesized and retain their protecting groups, which have specific codes. Bortezomib is Pyz–Phe–boroLeu, and MG132 is Z–Leu–Leu–Leu–al. To aid in the analysis of protein structure, photo-reactive amino acid analogs are available. These include photoleucine (pLeu) and photomethionine (pMet). Amino acids are the precursors to proteins. They join by condensation reactions to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins. These chains are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid residue within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids. In nature, the process of making proteins encoded by RNA genetic material is called translation and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme that is called a ribosome. The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the genetic code from an mRNA template, which is an RNA derived from one of the organism's genes. Twenty-two amino acids are naturally incorporated into polypeptides and are called proteinogenic or natural amino acids. Of these, 20 are encoded by the universal genetic code. The remaining 2, selenocysteine and pyrrolysine, are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms. Selenocysteine is incorporated when the mRNA being translated includes a SECIS element, which causes the UGA codon to encode selenocysteine instead of a stop codon. Pyrrolysine is used by some methanogenic archaea in enzymes that they use to produce methane. It is coded for with the codon UAG, which is normally a stop codon in other organisms. Several independent evolutionary studies have suggested that Gly, Ala, Asp, Val, Ser, Pro, Glu, Leu, Thr may belong to a group of amino acids that constituted the early genetic code, whereas Cys, Met, Tyr, Trp, His, Phe may belong to a group of amino acids that constituted later additions of the genetic code. The 20 amino acids that are encoded directly by the codons of the universal genetic code are called standard or canonical amino acids. A modified form of methionine (N-formylmethionine) is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and plastids (including chloroplasts). Other amino acids are called nonstandard or non-canonical. Most of the nonstandard amino acids are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation), but two of them are proteinogenic, as they can be incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code. The two nonstandard proteinogenic amino acids are selenocysteine (present in many non-eukaryotes as well as most eukaryotes, but not coded directly by DNA) and pyrrolysine (found only in some archaea and at least one bacterium). The incorporation of these nonstandard amino acids is rare. For example, 25 human proteins include selenocysteine in their primary structure, and the structurally characterized enzymes (selenoenzymes) employ selenocysteine as the catalytic moiety in their active sites. Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons. For example, selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon and SECIS element. N-formylmethionine (which is often the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts) is generally considered as a form of methionine rather than as a separate proteinogenic amino acid. Codon–tRNA combinations not found in nature can also be used to ""expand"" the genetic code and form novel proteins known as alloproteins incorporating non-proteinogenic amino acids. Aside from the 22 proteinogenic amino acids, many non-proteinogenic amino acids are known. Those either are not found in proteins (for example carnitine, GABA, levothyroxine) or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery. For example, hydroxyproline, is synthesised from proline. Another example is selenomethionine). Non-proteinogenic amino acids that are found in proteins are formed by post-translational modification. Such modifications can also determine the localization of the protein, e.g., the addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to a phospholipid membrane. Examples: Some non-proteinogenic amino acids are not found in proteins. Examples include 2-aminoisobutyric acid and the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. Non-proteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in the metabolic pathways for standard amino acids – for example, ornithine and citrulline occur in the urea cycle, part of amino acid catabolism (see below). A rare exception to the dominance of α-amino acids in biology is the β-amino acid beta alanine (3-aminopropanoic acid), which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), a component of coenzyme A. Animals ingest amino acids in the form of protein. The protein is broken down into its constituent amino acids in the process of digestion. The amino acids are then used to synthesize new proteins and other nitrogenous biomolecules, or they are further catabolized through oxidation to provide a source of energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase; the amino group is then fed into the urea cycle. The other product of transamidation is a keto acid that enters the citric acid cycle. Glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis. Of the 20 standard amino acids, nine (His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp and Val) are called essential amino acids because the human body cannot synthesize them from other compounds at the level needed for normal growth, so they must be obtained from food. In addition, cysteine, tyrosine, and arginine are considered semiessential amino acids, and taurine a semi-essential aminosulfonic acid in children. Some amino acids are conditionally essential for certain ages or medical conditions. Essential amino acids may also vary from species to species.[j] The metabolic pathways that synthesize these monomers are not fully developed. Many proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids have biological functions beyond being precursors to proteins and peptides. In humans, amino acids also have important roles in diverse biosynthetic pathways. Defenses against herbivores in plants sometimes employ amino acids. Examples: However, not all of the functions of other abundant nonstandard amino acids are known. Amino acids are sometimes added to animal feed because some of the components of these feeds, such as soybeans, have low levels of some of the essential amino acids, especially of lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan. Likewise amino acids are used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from feed supplements. The food industry is a major consumer of amino acids, especially glutamic acid, which is used as a flavor enhancer, and aspartame (aspartylphenylalanine 1-methyl ester), which is used as an artificial sweetener. Amino acids are sometimes added to food by manufacturers to alleviate symptoms of mineral deficiencies, such as anemia, by improving mineral absorption and reducing negative side effects from inorganic mineral supplementation. Amino acids are low-cost feedstocks used in chiral pool synthesis as enantiomerically pure building blocks. Amino acids are used in the synthesis of some cosmetics. The chelating ability of amino acids is sometimes used in fertilizers to facilitate the delivery of minerals to plants in order to correct mineral deficiencies, such as iron chlorosis. These fertilizers are also used to prevent deficiencies from occurring and to improve the overall health of the plants. Amino acids have been considered as components of biodegradable polymers, which have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery and the construction of prosthetic implants. An interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture. Due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradable antiscaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor. The commercial production of amino acids usually relies on mutant bacteria that overproduce individual amino acids using glucose as a carbon source. Some amino acids are produced by enzymatic conversions of synthetic intermediates. 2-Aminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid is an intermediate in one industrial synthesis of L-cysteine for example. Aspartic acid is produced by the addition of ammonia to fumarate using a lyase. In plants, nitrogen is first assimilated into organic compounds in the form of glutamate, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. For other amino acids, plants use transaminases to move the amino group from glutamate to another alpha-keto acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too. Nonstandard amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids. For example, homocysteine is formed through the transsulfuration pathway or by the demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite S-adenosylmethionine, while hydroxyproline is made by a post translational modification of proline. Microorganisms and plants synthesize many uncommon amino acids. For example, some microbes make 2-aminoisobutyric acid and lanthionine, which is a sulfide-bridged derivative of alanine. Both of these amino acids are found in peptidic lantibiotics such as alamethicin. However, in plants, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid is a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid that is an intermediate in the production of the plant hormone ethylene. The formation of amino acids and peptides is assumed to have preceded and perhaps induced the emergence of life on earth. Amino acids can form from simple precursors under various conditions. Surface-based chemical metabolism of amino acids and very small compounds may have led to the build-up of amino acids, coenzymes and phosphate-based small carbon molecules.[additional citation(s) needed] Amino acids and similar building blocks could have been elaborated into proto-peptides, with peptides being considered key players in the origin of life. In the famous Urey-Miller experiment, the passage of an electric arc through a mixture of methane, hydrogen, and ammonia produces a large number of amino acids. Since then, scientists have discovered a range of ways and components by which the potentially prebiotic formation and chemical evolution of peptides may have occurred, such as condensing agents, the design of self-replicating peptides and a number of non-enzymatic mechanisms by which amino acids could have emerged and elaborated into peptides. Several hypotheses invoke the Strecker synthesis whereby hydrogen cyanide, simple aldehydes, ammonia, and water produce amino acids. According to a review, amino acids, and even peptides, ""turn up fairly regularly in the various experimental broths that have been allowed to be cooked from simple chemicals. This is because nucleotides are far more difficult to synthesize chemically than amino acids."" For a chronological order, it suggests that there must have been a 'protein world' or at least a 'polypeptide world', possibly later followed by the 'RNA world' and the 'DNA world'. Codon–amino acids mappings may be the biological information system at the primordial origin of life on Earth. While amino acids and consequently simple peptides must have formed under different experimentally probed geochemical scenarios, the transition from an abiotic world to the first life forms is to a large extent still unresolved. Amino acids undergo the reactions expected of the constituent functional groups. As both the amine and carboxylic acid groups of amino acids can react to form amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As a result of this mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus. However, not all peptide bonds are formed in this way. In a few cases, peptides are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide glutathione is an essential part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids. In the first step, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamate through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione. In chemistry, peptides are synthesized by a variety of reactions. One of the most-used in solid-phase peptide synthesis uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain, which is attached to a solid resin support. Libraries of peptides are used in drug discovery through high-throughput screening. The combination of functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal–amino acid chelates. The multiple side chains of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions. Degradation of an amino acid often involves deamination by moving its amino group to α-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. This process involves transaminases, often the same as those used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the urea cycle and is excreted in the form of urea. However, amino acid degradation can produce uric acid or ammonia instead. For example, serine dehydratase converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia. After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle, as detailed in image at right. Amino acids are bidentate ligands, forming transition metal amino acid complexes. The total nitrogen content of organic matter is mainly formed by the amino groups in proteins. The Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) is a measure of nitrogen widely used in the analysis of (waste) water, soil, food, feed and organic matter in general. As the name suggests, the Kjeldahl method is applied. More sensitive methods are available.

Amoebae,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebae,"An amoeba (/əˈmiːbə/; less commonly spelled ameba or amœba; pl.: amoebas (less commonly, amebas) or amoebae (amebae) /əˈmiːbi/), often called an amoeboid, is a type of cell or unicellular organism with the ability to alter its shape, primarily by extending and retracting pseudopods. Amoebae do not form a single taxonomic group; instead, they are found in every major lineage of eukaryotic organisms. Amoeboid cells occur not only among the protozoa, but also in fungi, algae, and animals. Microbiologists often use the terms ""amoeboid"" and ""amoeba"" interchangeably for any organism that exhibits amoeboid movement. In older classification systems, most amoebae were placed in the class or subphylum Sarcodina, a grouping of single-celled organisms that possess pseudopods or move by protoplasmic flow. However, molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that Sarcodina is not a monophyletic group whose members share common descent. Consequently, amoeboid organisms are no longer classified together in one group. The best known amoeboid protists are Chaos carolinense and Amoeba proteus, both of which have been widely cultivated and studied in classrooms and laboratories. Other well known species include the so-called ""brain-eating amoeba"" Naegleria fowleri, the intestinal parasite Entamoeba histolytica, which causes amoebic dysentery, and the multicellular ""social amoeba"" or slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum. Amoeba do not have cell walls, which allows for free movement. Amoeba move and feed by using pseudopods, which are bulges of cytoplasm formed by the coordinated action of actin microfilaments pushing out the plasma membrane that surrounds the cell. The appearance and internal structure of pseudopods are used to distinguish groups of amoebae from one another. Amoebozoan species, such as those in the genus Amoeba, typically have bulbous (lobose) pseudopods, rounded at the ends and roughly tubular in cross-section. Cercozoan amoeboids, such as Euglypha and Gromia, have slender, thread-like (filose) pseudopods. Foraminifera emit fine, branching pseudopods that merge with one another to form net-like (reticulose) structures. Some groups, such as the Radiolaria and Heliozoa, have stiff, needle-like, radiating axopodia (actinopoda) supported from within by bundles of microtubules. Free-living amoebae may be ""testate"" (enclosed within a hard shell), or ""naked"" (also known as gymnamoebae, lacking any hard covering). The shells of testate amoebae may be composed of various substances, including calcium, silica, chitin, or agglutinations of found materials like small grains of sand and the frustules of diatoms. To regulate osmotic pressure, most freshwater amoebae have a contractile vacuole which expels excess water from the cell. This organelle is necessary because freshwater has a lower concentration of solutes (such as salt) than the amoeba's own internal fluids (cytosol). Because the surrounding water is hypotonic with respect to the contents of the cell, water is transferred across the amoeba's cell membrane by osmosis. Without a contractile vacuole, the cell would fill with excess water and, eventually, burst. Marine amoebae do not usually possess a contractile vacuole because the concentration of solutes within the cell are in balance with the tonicity of the surrounding water. The food sources of amoebae vary. Some amoebae are predatory and live by consuming bacteria and other protists. Some are detritivores and eat dead organic material. Amoebae typically ingest their food by phagocytosis, extending pseudopods to encircle and engulf live prey or particles of scavenged material. Amoeboid cells do not have a mouth or cytostome, and there is no fixed place on the cell at which phagocytosis normally occurs. Some amoebae also feed by pinocytosis, imbibing dissolved nutrients through vesicles formed within the cell membrane. The size of amoeboid cells and species is extremely variable. The marine amoeboid Massisteria voersi is just 2.3 to 3 micrometres in diameter, within the size range of many bacteria. At the other extreme, the shells of deep-sea xenophyophores can attain 20 cm in diameter. Most of the free-living freshwater amoebae commonly found in pond water, ditches, and lakes are microscopic, but some species, such as the so-called ""giant amoebae"" Pelomyxa palustris and Chaos carolinense, can be large enough to see with the naked eye. Recent evidence indicates that several Amoebozoa lineages undergo meiosis. Orthologs of genes employed in meiosis of sexual eukaryotes have recently been identified in the Acanthamoeba genome. These genes included Spo11, Mre11, Rad50, Rad51, Rad52, Mnd1, Dmc1, Msh and Mlh. This finding suggests that the ‘'Acanthamoeba'’ are capable of some form of meiosis and may be able to undergo sexual reproduction. The meiosis-specific recombinase, Dmc1, is required for efficient meiotic homologous recombination, and Dmc1 is expressed in Entamoeba histolytica. The purified Dmc1 from E. histolytica forms presynaptic filaments and catalyses ATP-dependent homologous DNA pairing and DNA strand exchange over at least several thousand base pairs. The DNA pairing and strand exchange reactions are enhanced by the eukaryotic meiosis-specific recombination accessory factor (heterodimer) Hop2-Mnd1. These processes are central to meiotic recombination, suggesting that E. histolytica undergoes meiosis. Studies of Entamoeba invadens found that, during the conversion from the tetraploid uninucleate trophozoite to the tetranucleate cyst, homologous recombination is enhanced. Expression of genes with functions related to the major steps of meiotic recombination also increase during encystations. These findings in E. invadens, combined with evidence from studies of E. histolytica indicate the presence of meiosis in the Entamoeba. Dictyostelium discoideum in the supergroup Amoebozoa can undergo mating and sexual reproduction including meiosis when food is scarce. Since the Amoebozoa diverged early from the eukaryotic family tree, these results suggest that meiosis was present early in eukaryotic evolution. Furthermore, these findings are consistent with the proposal of Lahr et al. that the majority of amoeboid lineages are anciently sexual. Some amoebae can infect other organisms pathogenically, causing disease: Amoeba have been found to harvest and grow the bacteria implicated in plague. Amoebae can likewise play host to microscopic organisms that are pathogenic to people and help in spreading such microbes. Bacterial pathogens (for example, Legionella) can oppose absorption of food when devoured by amoebae. The currently generally utilized and best-explored amoebae that host other organisms are Acanthamoeba castellanii and Dictyostelium discoideum. Microorganisms that can overcome the defenses of one-celled organisms can shelter and multiply inside them, where they are shielded from unfriendly outside conditions by their hosts. The earliest record of an amoeboid organism was produced in 1755 by August Johann Rösel von Rosenhof, who named his discovery ""Der Kleine Proteus"" (""the Little Proteus""). Rösel's illustrations show an unidentifiable freshwater amoeba, similar in appearance to the common species now known as Amoeba proteus. The term ""Proteus animalcule"" remained in use throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, as an informal name for any large, free-living amoeboid. In 1822, the genus Amiba (from the Greek ἀμοιβή amoibe, meaning ""change"") was erected by the French naturalist Bory de Saint-Vincent. Bory's contemporary, C. G. Ehrenberg, adopted the genus in his own classification of microscopic creatures, but changed the spelling to Amoeba. In 1841, Félix Dujardin coined the term ""sarcode"" (from Greek σάρξ sarx, ""flesh,"" and εἶδος eidos, ""form"") for the ""thick, glutinous, homogeneous substance"" which fills protozoan cell bodies.: 26 Although the term originally referred to the protoplasm of any protozoan, it soon came to be used in a restricted sense to designate the gelatinous contents of amoeboid cells. Thirty years later, the Austrian zoologist Ludwig Karl Schmarda used ""sarcode"" as the conceptual basis for his division Sarcodea, a phylum-level group made up of ""unstable, changeable"" organisms with bodies largely composed of ""sarcode"".: 156 Later workers, including the influential taxonomist Otto Bütschli, amended this group to create the class Sarcodina,: 1 a taxon that remained in wide use throughout most of the 20th century. For convenience, all amoebae were grouped as Sarcodina and generally divided into morphological categories, on the basis of the form and structure of their pseudopods. Amoebae with pseudopods supported by regular arrays of microtubules (such as the freshwater Heliozoa and marine Radiolaria) were classified as Actinopoda, whereas those with unsupported pseudopods were classified as Rhizopoda. The Rhizopods were further subdivided into lobose, filose, plasmodial and reticulose, according to the morphology of their pseudopods. During the 1980s, taxonomists reached the following classification, based exclusively on morphological comparisons: Archezoa Percolozoa (Heterolobosea) other excavates Eosarcodina Neosarcodina Apusozoa → Choanozoa → Animals, Fungi Actinopoda Alveolata → Plants, Chromista In the final decades of the 20th century, a series of molecular phylogenetic analyses confirmed that Sarcodina was not a monophyletic group, and that amoebae evolved from flagellate ancestors. The protozoologist Thomas Cavalier-Smith proposed that the ancestor of most eukaryotes was an amoeboflagellate much like modern heteroloboseans, which in turn gave rise to a paraphyletic Sarcodina from which other groups (e.g., alveolates, animals, plants) evolved by a secondary loss of the amoeboid phase. In his scheme, the Sarcodina were divided into the more primitive Eosarcodina (with the phyla Reticulosa and Mycetozoa) and the more derived Neosarcodina (with the phyla Amoebozoa for lobose amoebae and Rhizopoda for filose amoebae). Shortly after, phylogenetic analyses disproved this hypothesis, as non-amoeboid zooflagellates and amoeboflagellates were found to be completely intermingled with amoebae. With the addition of many flagellates to Rhizopoda and the removal of some amoebae, the name was rejected in favour of a new name Cercozoa. As such, both names Rhizopoda and Sarcodina were finally abandoned as formal taxa, but they remained useful as descriptive terms for amoebae.: 238 The phylum Amoebozoa was conserved, as it still primarily included amoeboid organisms, and now included the Mycetozoa.: 232 Today, amoebae are dispersed among many high-level taxonomic groups. The majority of traditional sarcodines are placed in two eukaryote supergroups: Amoebozoa and Rhizaria. The rest have been distributed among the excavates, opisthokonts, stramenopiles and minor clades. The following cladogram shows the sparse positions of amoeboid groups (in bold), based on molecular phylogenetic analyses: Stramenopiles alveolates Rhizaria haptophytes Centroplasthelida plants, etc. euglenids, etc. Heterolobosea CRuMs (incl. Rigifilida) Amoebozoa Breviatea apusomonads Nucleariids Fungi animals, etc. Some multicellular organisms have amoeboid cells only in certain phases of life, or use amoeboid movements for specialized functions. In the immune system of humans and other animals, amoeboid white blood cells pursue invading organisms, such as bacteria and pathogenic protists, and engulf them by phagocytosis. Sponges exhibit a totipotent cell type known as archaeocytes, capable of transforming into the feeding cells or choanocytes. Amoeboid stages also occur in the multicellular fungus-like protists, the so-called slime moulds. Both the plasmodial slime moulds, currently classified in the class Myxogastria, and the cellular slime moulds of the groups Acrasida and Dictyosteliida, live as amoebae during their feeding stage. The amoeboid cells of the former combine to form a giant multinucleate organism, while the cells of the latter live separately until food runs out, at which time the amoebae aggregate to form a multicellular migrating ""slug"" which functions as a single organism. Other organisms may also present amoeboid cells during certain life-cycle stages, e.g., the gametes of some green algae (Zygnematophyceae) and pennate diatoms, the spores (or dispersal phases) of some Mesomycetozoea, and the sporoplasm stage of Myxozoa and of Ascetosporea.",Wiki
Anatomical_pathology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_pathology,"Anatomical pathology (Commonwealth) or anatomic pathology (U.S.) is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the macroscopic, microscopic, biochemical, immunologic and molecular examination of organs and tissues. Over the 20th century, surgical pathology has evolved tremendously: from historical examination of whole bodies (autopsy) to a more modernized practice, centered on the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer to guide treatment decision-making in oncology. Its modern founder was the Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Morgagni from Forlì. Anatomical pathology is one of two branches of pathology, the other being clinical pathology, the diagnosis of disease through the laboratory analysis of bodily fluids or tissues. Often, pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology, a combination known as general pathology. Similar specialties exist in veterinary pathology. Anatomic pathology relates to the processing, examination, and diagnosis of surgical specimens by a physician trained in pathological diagnosis. Clinical pathology involves the laboratory analysis of tissue samples and bodily fluids; procedures may include blood sample analysis, urinalysis, stool sample analysis, and analysis of spinal fluid. Clinical pathologists may specialize in a number of areas, including blood banking, clinical chemistry, microbiology, and hematology. The procedures used in anatomic pathology include: Surgical pathology is the most significant and time-consuming area of practice for most anatomical pathologists. Surgical pathology involves the gross and microscopic examination of surgical specimens, as well as biopsies submitted by non-surgeons such as general internists, medical subspecialists, dermatologists, and interventional radiologists. Surgical pathology increasingly requires technologies and skills traditionally associated with clinical pathology such as molecular diagnostics. In the United States, subspecialty-trained doctors of dentistry, rather than medical doctors, can be certified by a professional board to practice Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. Cytopathology is a sub-discipline of anatomical pathology concerned with the microscopic examination of whole, individual cells obtained from exfoliation or fine-needle aspirates. Cytopathologists are trained to perform fine-needle aspirates of superficially located organs, masses, or cysts and are often able to render an immediate diagnosis in the presence of the patient and consulting physician. In the case of screening tests such as the Papanicolaou smear, non-physician cytotechnologists are often employed to perform initial reviews, with only positive or uncertain cases examined by the pathologist. Cytopathology is a board-certifiable subspecialty in the U.S. Molecular pathology is an emerging discipline within anatomical and clinical pathology that is focused on the use of nucleic acid-based techniques such as in-situ hybridization, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and nucleic acid microarrays for specialized studies of disease in tissues and cells. Molecular pathology shares some aspects of practice with both anatomic and clinical pathology, and is sometimes considered a ""crossover"" discipline. Forensic pathologists receive specialized training in determining the cause of death and other legally relevant information from the bodies of persons who died suddenly with no known medical condition, those who die from non-natural causes, as well as those dying as a result of homicide, or other criminally suspicious deaths. A majority of the forensic pathologists cases are due to natural causes. Often, additional tests such as toxicology, histology, and genetic testing will be used to help the pathologist determine the cause of death. Forensic pathologists will often testify in courts regarding their findings in cases of homicide and suspicious death. They also play a large role in public health, such as investigating deaths in the workplace, deaths in custody, as well as sudden and unexpected deaths in children. Forensic pathologists often have special areas of interest within their practice, such as sudden death due to cardiac pathology, deaths due to drugs, or Sudden Infant Death (SIDS), and various others. Anatomical Pathology is one of the specialty training programs offered by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA). The RCPA. To qualify as a Fellow of the RCPA in Anatomical Pathology, the candidate must complete a recognised undergraduate or postgraduate medical qualification and then complete a minimum of 2 years of clinical medical experience as a prerequisite to selection as a training registrar. The training program is a minimum of 5 years, served in at least two laboratories, and candidates must pass a Basic Pathological Sciences examination (usually in first year), the Part 1 examinations (not before 3rd year) and the Part 2 examinations (not before 5th year). Fellows may then continue into subspecialty training. Anatomical Pathology (AP) is one of the specialist certificates granted by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. Other certificates related to pathology include general pathology (GP), hematopathology, and neuropathology. Candidates for any of these must have completed four years of medical school and five years of residency training. Anatomic Pathology (AP) is one of the two primary certifications offered by the American Board of Pathology (the other is Clinical Pathology (CP)) and one of three primary certifications offered by the American Osteopathic Board of Pathology. To be certified in anatomic pathology, the trainee must complete four years of medical school followed by three years of residency training. Many U.S. pathologists are certified in both AP and CP, which requires a total of four years of residency. After completing residency, many pathologists enroll in further years of fellowship training to gain expertise in a subspecialty of AP or CP. Pathologists' Assistants are highly trained medical professionals with specialized training in Anatomic and Forensic pathology. To become a Pathologists' Assistant one must enter and successfully complete a NAACLS accredited program and pass the ASCP Board of Certification Exam.",Wiki
Anatomy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy,"Anatomy (from Ancient Greek ἀνατομή (anatomḗ) 'dissection') is the branch of morphology concerned with the study of the internal structure of organisms and their parts. Anatomy is a branch of natural science that deals with the structural organization of living things. It is an old science, having its beginnings in prehistoric times. Anatomy is inherently tied to developmental biology, embryology, comparative anatomy, evolutionary biology, and phylogeny, as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated, both over immediate and long-term timescales. Anatomy and physiology, which study the structure and function of organisms and their parts respectively, make a natural pair of related disciplines, and are often studied together. Human anatomy is one of the essential basic sciences that are applied in medicine, and is often studied alongside physiology. Anatomy is a complex and dynamic field that is constantly evolving as discoveries are made. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the use of advanced imaging techniques, such as MRI and CT scans, which allow for more detailed and accurate visualizations of the body's structures. The discipline of anatomy is divided into macroscopic and microscopic parts. Macroscopic anatomy, or gross anatomy, is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided eyesight. Gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy. Microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the tissues of various structures, known as histology, and also in the study of cells. The history of anatomy is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers (corpses) to 20th-century medical imaging techniques, including X-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. Derived from the Greek ἀνατομή anatomē ""dissection"" (from ἀνατέμνω anatémnō ""I cut up, cut open"" from ἀνά aná ""up"", and τέμνω témnō ""I cut""), anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of organisms including their systems, organs and tissues. It includes the appearance and position of the various parts, the materials from which they are composed, and their relationships with other parts. Anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry, which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved. For example, an anatomist is concerned with the shape, size, position, structure, blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver; while a physiologist is interested in the production of bile, the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions. The discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a number of branches, including gross or macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy. Gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy, the study by sight of the external body features. Microscopic anatomy is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, along with histology (the study of tissues), and embryology (the study of an organism in its immature condition). Regional anatomy is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures in a specific body region, such as the abdomen. In contrast, systemic anatomy is the study of the structures that make up a discrete body system—that is, a group of structures that work together to perform a unique body function, such as the digestive system. Anatomy can be studied using both invasive and non-invasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems. Methods used include dissection, in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and endoscopy, in which a video camera-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures. Angiography using X-rays or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels. The term ""anatomy"" is commonly taken to refer to human anatomy. However, substantially similar structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom, and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals. The term zootomy is also sometimes used to specifically refer to non-human animals. The structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in plant anatomy. The kingdom Animalia contains multicellular organisms that are heterotrophic and motile (although some have secondarily adopted a sessile lifestyle). Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and these animals are also known as eumetazoans. They have an internal digestive chamber, with one or two openings; the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development. Metazoans do not include the sponges, which have undifferentiated cells. Unlike plant cells, animal cells have neither a cell wall nor chloroplasts. Vacuoles, when present, are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell. The body tissues are composed of numerous types of cells, including those found in muscles, nerves and skin. Each typically has a cell membrane formed of phospholipids, cytoplasm and a nucleus. All of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic germ layers. Those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called diploblastic and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called triploblastic. All of a triploblastic animal's tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo, the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. Animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types: connective, epithelial, muscle and nervous tissue. Connective tissues are fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix. Often called fascia (from the Latin ""fascia,"" meaning ""band"" or ""bandage""), connective tissues give shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, as well as in many of those less developed. Epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells. Muscle cells (myocytes) form the active contractile tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body. Nervous tissue is composed of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information. In some slow-moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians (including sea anemones and jellyfish), the nerves form a nerve net, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks to other parts of the organism. Neurons can be connected together in ganglia. In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral nervous system. The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle, and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle, certain glands and internal organs, including the stomach. All vertebrates have a similar basic body plan and at some point in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics: a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord, and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth, retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution. The body of a fish is divided into a head, trunk and tail, although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in cartilaginous fish, or bone in bony fish. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the fins, are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which with the exception of the caudal fins, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk. The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop. The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or middle ear. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure. Sharks and rays are basal fish with numerous primitive anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales. They have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a swim bladder. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, yolky eggs. Some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases. The bony fish lineage shows more derived anatomical traits, often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum, and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout. The dermis is covered with overlapping scales. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca. They mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column. Amphibians are a class of animals comprising frogs, salamanders and caecilians. They are tetrapods, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, but contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping, a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist. In frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs. The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side. Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid. Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers. Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi. The tuatara has a well-developed parietal eye on its forehead. Lizards have skulls with only one fenestra on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye. Snakes are closely related to lizards, having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the Cretaceous period, and they share many of the same features. The skeleton consists of a skull, a hyoid bone, spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of pelvic spurs. The bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole. Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent ""spectacle"" scales. They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull. Their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm-blooded prey. Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Birds are tetrapods but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping, their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight. Birds are endothermic, have a high metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks. The feathers are outgrowths of the epidermis and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near the base of the tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the tips of the toes. Mammals are a diverse class of animals, mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs, but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins, and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel. The teeth are shed once (milk teeth) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, as is the case in cetaceans. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat. Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers, and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea. Mammals are amniotes, and most are viviparous, giving birth to live young. Exceptions to this are the egg-laying monotremes, the platypus and the echidnas of Australia. Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a teat and completes its development. Humans have the overall body plan of a mammal. Humans have a head, neck, trunk (which includes the thorax and abdomen), two arms and hands, and two legs and feet. Generally, students of certain biological sciences, paramedics, prosthetists and orthotists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, podiatrists, and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers. The study of microscopic anatomy (or histology) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a microscope. Human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school. Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems. The major anatomy textbook, Gray's Anatomy, has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format, in line with modern teaching methods. A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians, especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as histopathology and radiology. Academic anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells. Invertebrates constitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as Paramecium to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus, lobster and dragonfly. They constitute about 95% of the animal species. By definition, none of these creatures has a backbone. The cells of single-cell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs. Locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia, food may be gathered by phagocytosis, energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton. Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies. Metazoans are a multicellular organism, with different groups of cells serving different functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms, sponges and some cephalopods. Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). Calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs, brachiopods and some tube-building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria. Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (polyps, sea anemones, jellyfish) and the collagenous cuticle of annelids. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as microvilli, cilia, bristles, spines and tubercles. Marcello Malpighi, the father of microscopical anatomy, discovered that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm. He observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves, and being captured above the ring. Arthropods comprise the largest phylum of invertebrates in the animal kingdom with over a million known species. Insects possess segmented bodies supported by a hard-jointed outer covering, the exoskeleton, made mostly of chitin. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head typically bears a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, one to three simple eyes (ocelli) and three sets of modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has three pairs of segmented legs, one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one or two pairs of wings. The abdomen is composed of eleven segments, some of which may be fused and houses the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive systems. There is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts, especially wings, legs, antennae and mouthparts. Spiders a class of arachnids have four pairs of legs; a body of two segments—a cephalothorax and an abdomen. Spiders have no wings and no antennae. They have mouthparts called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous. They have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax. These have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs. At the end of each male pedipalp is a spoon-shaped cymbium that acts to support the copulatory organ. In 1600 BCE, the Edwin Smith Papyrus, an Ancient Egyptian medical text, described the heart and its vessels, as well as the brain and its meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, and the liver, spleen, kidneys, uterus and bladder. It showed the blood vessels diverging from the heart. The Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550 BCE) features a ""treatise on the heart"", with vessels carrying all the body's fluids to or from every member of the body. Ancient Greek anatomy and physiology underwent great changes and advances throughout the early medieval world. Over time, this medical practice expanded due to a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body. Phenomenal anatomical observations of the human body were made, which contributed to the understanding of the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs, and nervous system. The Hellenistic Egyptian city of Alexandria was the stepping-stone for Greek anatomy and physiology. Alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and books of the liberal arts in the world during the time of the Greeks but was also home to many medical practitioners and philosophers. Great patronage of the arts and sciences from the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt helped raise Alexandria up, further rivalling other Greek states' cultural and scientific achievements. Some of the most striking advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in Hellenistic Alexandria. Two of the most famous anatomists and physiologists of the third century were Herophilus and Erasistratus. These two physicians helped pioneer human dissection for medical research, using the cadavers of condemned criminals, which was considered taboo until the Renaissance—Herophilus was recognized as the first person to perform systematic dissections. Herophilus became known for his anatomical works, making impressive contributions to many branches of anatomy and many other aspects of medicine. Some of the works included classifying the system of the pulse, the discovery that human arteries had thicker walls than veins, and that the atria were parts of the heart. Herophilus's knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs, and nervous system and characterizing the course of the disease. Erasistratus accurately described the structure of the brain, including the cavities and membranes, and made a distinction between its cerebrum and cerebellum During his study in Alexandria, Erasistratus was particularly concerned with studies of the circulatory and nervous systems. He could distinguish the human body's sensory and motor nerves and believed air entered the lungs and heart, which was then carried throughout the body. His distinction between the arteries and veins—the arteries carrying the air through the body, while the veins carry the blood from the heart was a great anatomical discovery. Erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the epiglottis and the heart's valves, including the tricuspid. During the third century, Greek physicians were able to differentiate nerves from blood vessels and tendons and to realize that the nerves convey neural impulses. It was Herophilus who made the point that damage to motor nerves induced paralysis. Herophilus named the meninges and ventricles in the brain, appreciated the division between cerebellum and cerebrum and recognized that the brain was the ""seat of intellect"" and not a ""cooling chamber"" as propounded by Aristotle Herophilus is also credited with describing the optic, oculomotor, motor division of the trigeminal, facial, vestibulocochlear and hypoglossal nerves. Incredible feats were made during the third century BCE in both the digestive and reproductive systems. Herophilus dis",Wiki
Ancient_Greece,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece,"Ancient Greece (Ancient Greek: Ἑλλάς, romanized: Hellás) was a northeastern Mediterranean civilization, existing from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th–9th centuries BC to the end of classical antiquity (c. 600 AD), that comprised a loose collection of culturally and linguistically related city-states and communities. Prior to the Roman period, most of these regions were officially unified only once under the Kingdom of Macedon from 338 to 323 BC.[a] In Western history, the era of classical antiquity was immediately followed by the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine period. Three centuries after the decline of Mycenaean Greece during the Bronze Age collapse, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the Archaic period and the colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the age of Classical Greece, from the Greco-Persian Wars to the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, and which included the Golden Age of Athens and the Peloponnesian War. The unification of Greece by Macedon under Philip II and subsequent conquest of the Achaemenid Empire by Alexander the Great spread Hellenistic civilization across the Middle East. The Hellenistic period is considered to have ended in 30 BC, when the last Hellenistic kingdom, Ptolemaic Egypt, was annexed by the Roman Republic. Classical Greek culture, especially philosophy, had a powerful influence on ancient Rome, which carried a version of it throughout the Mediterranean and much of Europe. For this reason, Classical Greece is generally considered the cradle of Western civilization, the seminal culture from which the modern West derives many of its founding archetypes and ideas in politics, philosophy, science, and art. Classical antiquity in the Mediterranean region is commonly considered to have begun in the 8th century BC (around the time of the earliest recorded poetry of Homer) and ended in the 6th century AD. Classical antiquity in Greece was preceded by the Greek Dark Ages (c. 1200 – c. 800 BC), archaeologically characterised by the protogeometric and geometric styles of designs on pottery. Following the Dark Ages was the Archaic period, beginning around the 8th century BC, which saw early developments in Greek culture and society leading to the Classical period from the Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC until the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC. The Classical period is characterized by a ""classical"" style, i.e. one which was considered exemplary by later observers, most famously in the Parthenon of Athens. Politically, the Classical period was dominated by Athens and the Delian League during the 5th century, but displaced by Spartan hegemony during the early 4th century BC, before power shifted to Thebes and the Boeotian League and finally to the League of Corinth led by Macedon. This period was shaped by the Greco-Persian Wars, the Peloponnesian War, and the Rise of Macedon. Following the Classical period was the Hellenistic period (323–146 BC), during which Greek culture and power expanded into the Near East from the death of Alexander until the Roman conquest. Roman Greece is usually counted from the Roman victory over the Corinthians at the Battle of Corinth in 146 BC to the establishment of Byzantium by Constantine as the capital of the Roman Empire in 330 AD. Finally, Late Antiquity refers to the period of Christianization during the later 4th to early 6th centuries AD, consummated by the closure of the Academy of Athens by Justinian I in 529. The historical period of ancient Greece is unique in world history as the first period attested directly in comprehensive, narrative historiography, while earlier ancient history or protohistory is known from much more fragmentary documents such as annals, king lists, and pragmatic epigraphy. Herodotus is widely known as the ""father of history"": his Histories are eponymous of the entire field. Written between the 450s and 420s BC, Herodotus' work reaches about a century into the past, discussing 6th-century BC historical figures such as Darius I of Persia, Cambyses II and Psamtik III, and alluding to some 8th-century BC persons such as Candaules. The accuracy of Herodotus' works is debated. Herodotus was succeeded by authors such as Thucydides, Xenophon, Demosthenes, Plato and Aristotle. Most were either Athenian or pro-Athenian, which is why far more is known about the history and politics of Athens than of many other cities. Their scope is further limited by a focus on political, military and diplomatic history, ignoring economic and social history. The archaic period, lasting approximately from 800 to 500 BC, saw the culmination of political and social developments which had begun in the Greek dark age, with the polis (city-state) becoming the most important unit of political organisation in Greece. The absence of powerful states in Greece after the collapse of Mycenaean power, and the geography of Greece, where many settlements were separated from their neighbours by mountainous terrain, encouraged the development of small independent city-states. Several Greek states saw tyrants rise to power in this period, most famously at Corinth from 657 BC. The period also saw the founding of Greek colonies around the Mediterranean, with Euboean settlements at Al-Mina in the east as early as 800 BC, and Ischia in the west by 775. Increasing contact with non-Greek peoples in this period, especially in the Near East, inspired developments in art and architecture, the adoption of coinage, and the development of the Greek alphabet. Athens developed its democratic system over the course of the archaic period. Already in the 7th century, the right of all citizen men to attend the assembly appears to have been established. After a failed coup led by Cylon of Athens around 636 BC, Draco was appointed to establish a code of laws in 621. This failed to reduce the political tension between the poor and the elites, and in 594 Solon was given the authority to enact another set of reforms, which attempted to balance the power of the rich and the poor. In the middle of the 6th century, Pisistratus established himself as a tyrant, and after his death in 527 his son Hippias inherited his position; by the end of the 6th century he had been overthrown, and Cleisthenes carried out further democratising reforms. In Sparta, a political system with two kings, a council of elders, and five ephors developed over the course of the 8th and 7th centuries. According to Spartan tradition, this constitution was established by the legendary lawgiver Lycurgus. Over the course of the first and second Messenian wars, Sparta subjugated the neighbouring region of Messenia, enserfing the population. In the 6th century, Greek city-states began to develop formal relationships with one another, where previously individual rulers had relied on personal relationships with the elites of other cities. Towards the end of the Archaic period, Sparta began to build a series of alliances, the Peloponnesian League, with cities including Corinth, Elis, and Megara, isolating Messenia and reinforcing Sparta's position against Argos, the other major power in the Peloponnese. Other alliances in the 6th century included those between Elis and Heraea in the Peloponnese; and between the Greek colony Sybaris in southern Italy, its allies, and the Serdaioi. In 499 BC, the Ionian city states under Persian rule rebelled against their Persian-supported tyrant rulers. Supported by troops sent from Athens and Eretria, they advanced as far as Sardis and burnt the city before being driven back by a Persian counterattack. The revolt continued until 494, when the rebelling Ionians were defeated. Darius did not forget that Athens had assisted the Ionian revolt, and in 490 he assembled an armada to retaliate. Though heavily outnumbered, the Athenians—supported by their Plataean allies—defeated the Persian hordes at the Battle of Marathon, and the Persian fleet turned tail. Ten years later, a second invasion was launched by Darius' son Xerxes. The city-states of northern and central Greece submitted to the Persian forces without resistance, but a coalition of 31 Greek city states, including Athens and Sparta, determined to resist the Persian invaders. At the same time, Greek Sicily was invaded by a Carthaginian force. In 480 BC, the first major battle of the invasion was fought at Thermopylae, where a small rearguard of Greeks, led by three hundred Spartans, held a crucial pass guarding the heart of Greece for several days; at the same time Gelon, tyrant of Syracuse, defeated the Carthaginian invasion at the Battle of Himera. The Persians were decisively defeated at sea by a primarily Athenian naval force at the Battle of Salamis, and on land in 479 BC at the Battle of Plataea. The alliance against Persia continued, initially led by the Spartan Pausanias but from 477 by Athens, and by 460 Persia had been driven out of the Aegean. During this long campaign, the Delian League gradually transformed from a defensive alliance of Greek states into an Athenian empire, as Athens' growing naval power intimidated the other league states. Athens ended its campaigns against Persia in 450, after a disastrous defeat in Egypt in 454, and the death of Cimon in action against the Persians on Cyprus in 450. As the Athenian fight against the Persian empire waned, conflict grew between Athens and Sparta. Suspicious of the increasing Athenian power funded by the Delian League, Sparta offered aid to reluctant members of the League to rebel against Athenian domination. These tensions were exacerbated in 462 BC when Athens sent a force to aid Sparta in overcoming a helot revolt, but this aid was rejected by the Spartans. In the 450s, Athens took control of Boeotia, and won victories over Aegina and Corinth. However, Athens failed to win a decisive victory, and in 447 lost Boeotia again. Athens and Sparta signed the Thirty Years' Peace in the winter of 446/445, ending the conflict. Despite the treaty, Athenian relations with Sparta declined again in the 430s, and in 431 BC the Peloponnesian War began. The first phase of the war saw a series of fruitless annual invasions of Attica by Sparta, while Athens successfully fought the Corinthian empire in northwest Greece and defended its own empire, despite a plague which killed the leading Athenian statesman Pericles. The war turned after Athenian victories led by Cleon at Pylos and Sphakteria, and Sparta sued for peace, but the Athenians rejected the proposal. The Athenian failure to regain control of Boeotia at Delium and Brasidas' successes in northern Greece in 424 improved Sparta's position after Sphakteria. After the deaths of Cleon and Brasidas, the strongest proponents of war on each side, a peace treaty was negotiated in 421 by the Athenian general Nicias. The peace did not last, however. In 418 BC allied forces of Athens and Argos were defeated by Sparta at Mantinea. In 415 Athens launched an ambitious naval expedition to dominate Sicily; the expedition ended in disaster at the harbor of Syracuse, with almost the entire army killed, and the ships destroyed. Soon after the Athenian defeat in Syracuse, Athens' Ionian allies began to rebel against the Delian league, while Persia began to once again involve itself in Greek affairs on the Spartan side. Initially the Athenian position continued relatively strong, with important victories at Cyzicus in 410 and Arginusae in 406. However, in 405 the Spartan Lysander defeated Athens in the Battle of Aegospotami, and began to blockade Athens' harbour; driven by hunger, Athens sued for peace, agreeing to surrender their fleet and join the Spartan-led Peloponnesian League. Following the Athenian surrender, Sparta installed an oligarchic regime, the Thirty Tyrants, in Athens, one of a number of Spartan-backed oligarchies which rose to power after the Peloponnesian war. Spartan predominance did not last: after only a year, the Thirty had been overthrown. The first half of the 4th century saw the major Greek states attempt to dominate the mainland; none were successful, and their resulting weakness led to a power vacuum which was eventually filled by Macedon under Philip II and then Alexander the Great. In the immediate aftermath of the Peloponnesian war, Sparta attempted to extend their own power, leading Argos, Athens, Corinth, and Thebes to join against them. Aiming to prevent any single Greek state gaining the dominance that would allow it to challenge Persia, the Persian king initially joined the alliance against Sparta, before imposing the Peace of Antalcidas (""King's Peace"") which restored Persia's control over the Anatolian Greeks. By 371 BC, Thebes was in the ascendancy, defeating Sparta at the Battle of Leuctra, killing the Spartan king Cleombrotus I, and invading Laconia. Further Theban successes against Sparta in 369 led to Messenia gaining independence; Sparta never recovered from the loss of Messenia's fertile land and the helot workforce it provided. The rising power of Thebes led Sparta and Athens to join forces; in 362 they were defeated by Thebes at the Battle of Mantinea. In the aftermath of Mantinea, none of the major Greek states were able to dominate. Though Thebes had won the battle, their general Epaminondas was killed, and they spent the following decades embroiled in wars with their neighbours; Athens, meanwhile, saw its second naval alliance, formed in 377, collapse in the mid-350s. The power vacuum in Greece after the Battle of Mantinea was filled by Macedon, under Philip II. In 338 BC, he defeated a Greek alliance at the Battle of Chaeronea, and subsequently formed the League of Corinth. Philip planned to lead the League to invade Persia, but was murdered in 336 BC. His son Alexander the Great was left to fulfil his father's ambitions. After campaigns against Macedon's western and northern enemies, and those Greek states that had broken from the League of Corinth following the death of Philip, Alexander began his campaign against Persia in 334 BC. He conquered Persia, defeating Darius III at the Battle of Issus in 333 BC, and after the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC proclaimed himself king of Asia. From 329 BC he led expeditions to Bactria and then India; further plans to invade Arabia and North Africa were halted by his death in 323 BC. The period from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC until the death of Cleopatra, the last Macedonian ruler of Egypt, is known as the Hellenistic period. In the early part of this period, a new form of kingship developed based on Macedonian and Near Eastern traditions. The first Hellenistic kings were previously Alexander's generals, and took power in the period following his death, though they were not part of existing royal lineages and lacked historic claims to the territories they controlled. The most important of these rulers in the decades after Alexander's death were Antigonus I and his son Demetrius in Macedonia and the rest of Greece, Ptolemy in Egypt, and Seleucus I in Syria and the former Persian empire; smaller Hellenistic kingdoms included the Attalids in Anatolia and the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. In the early part of the Hellenistic period, the exact borders of the Hellenistic kingdoms were not settled. Antigonus attempted to expand his territory by attacking the other successor kingdoms until they joined against him, and he was killed at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. His son Demetrius spent many years in Seleucid captivity, and his son, Antigonus II, only reclaimed the Macedonian throne around 276. Meanwhile, the Seleucid kingdom gave up territory in the east to the Indian king Chandragupta Maurya in exchange for war elephants, and later lost large parts of Persia to the Parthian Empire. By the mid-3rd century, the kingdoms of Alexander's successors was mostly stable, though there continued to be disputes over border areas. The great capitals of Hellenistic culture were Alexandria in the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Antioch in the Seleucid Empire. The conquests of Alexander had numerous consequences for the Greek city-states. It greatly widened the horizons of the Greeks and led to a steady emigration of the young and ambitious to the new Greek empires in the east. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch and the many other new Hellenistic cities founded in Alexander's wake, as far away as present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom survived until the end of the 1st century BC. The city-states within Greece formed themselves into two leagues; the Achaean League (including Corinth and Argos) and the Aetolian League (including Sparta and Athens).[citation needed] For much of the period until the Roman conquest, these leagues were at war, often participating in the conflicts between the Diadochi (the successor states to Alexander's empire).[citation needed] The Antigonid Kingdom became involved in a war with the Roman Republic in the late 3rd century. Although the First Macedonian War was inconclusive, the Romans, in typical fashion, continued to fight Macedon until it was completely absorbed into the Roman Republic (by 149 BC). In the east, the unwieldy Seleucid Empire gradually disintegrated, although a rump survived until 64 BC, whilst the Ptolemaic Kingdom continued in Egypt until 30 BC when it too was conquered by the Romans. The Aetolian league grew wary of Roman involvement in Greece, and sided with the Seleucids in the Roman–Seleucid War; when the Romans were victorious, the league was effectively absorbed into the Republic. Although the Achaean league outlasted both the Aetolian league and Macedon, it was also soon defeated and absorbed by the Romans in 146 BC, bringing Greek independence to an end. The Greek peninsula came under Roman rule during the 146 BC conquest of Greece after the Battle of Corinth. Macedonia became a Roman province while southern Greece came under the surveillance of Macedonia's prefect; however, some Greek poleis managed to maintain a partial independence and avoid taxation. The Aegean Islands were added to this territory in 133 BC. Athens and other Greek cities revolted in 88 BC, and the peninsula was crushed by the Roman general Sulla. The Roman civil wars devastated the land even further, until Augustus organized the peninsula as the province of Achaea in 27 BC. Greece was a key eastern province of the Roman Empire, as the Roman culture had long been in fact Greco-Roman. The Greek language served as a lingua franca in the East and in Italy, and many Greek intellectuals such as Galen would perform most of their work in Rome. The territory of Greece is mountainous, and as a result, ancient Greece consisted of many smaller regions, each with its own dialect, cultural peculiarities, and identity. Regionalism and regional conflicts were prominent features of ancient Greece. Cities tended to be located in valleys between mountains, or on coastal plains, and dominated a certain area around them. In the south lay the Peloponnese, consisting of the regions of Laconia (southeast), Messenia (southwest), Elis (west), Achaia (north), Korinthia (northeast), Argolis (east), and Arcadia (center). These names survive to the present day as regional units of modern Greece, though with somewhat different boundaries. Mainland Greece to the north, nowadays known as Central Greece, consisted of Aetolia and Acarnania in the west, Locris, Doris, and Phocis in the center, while in the east lay Boeotia, Attica, and Megaris. Northeast lay Thessaly, while Epirus lay to the northwest. Epirus stretched from the Ambracian Gulf in the south to the Ceraunian Mountains and the Aoos river in the north, and consisted of Chaonia (north), Molossia (center), and Thesprotia (south). In the northeast corner was Macedonia, originally consisting Lower Macedonia and its regions, such as Elimeia, Pieria, and Orestis. Around the time of Alexander I of Macedon, the Argead kings of Macedon started to expand into Upper Macedonia, lands inhabited by independent Macedonian tribes like the Lyncestae, Orestae and the Elimiotae and to the west, beyond the Axius river, into Eordaia, Bottiaea, Mygdonia, and Almopia, regions settled by Thracian tribes. To the north of Macedonia lay various non-Greek peoples such as the Paeonians due north, the Thracians to the northeast, and the Illyrians, with whom the Macedonians were frequently in conflict, to the northwest. Chalcidice was settled early on by southern Greek colonists and was considered part of the Greek world, while from the late 2nd millennium BC substantial Greek settlement also occurred on the eastern shores of the Aegean, in Anatolia. During the Archaic period, the Greek population grew beyond the capacity of the limited arable land of Greece proper, resulting in the large-scale establishment of colonies elsewhere: according to one estimate, the population of the widening area of Greek settlement increased roughly ten-fold from 800 to 400 BC, from 800,000 to as many as 7+1⁄2–10 million. This was not simply for trade, but also to found settlements. These Greek colonies were not, as Roman colonies were, dependent on their mother-city, but were independent city-states in their own right. Greeks settled outside of Greece in two distinct ways. The first was in permanent settlements founded by Greeks, which formed as independent poleis. The second form was in what historians refer to as emporia; trading posts which were occupied by both Greeks and non-Greeks and which were primarily concerned with the manufacture and sale of goods. Examples of this latter type of settlement are found at Al Mina in the east and Pithekoussai in the west. From around 750 to 500 BC, Greeks settled colonies in all directions. To the east, the Aegean coast of Asia Minor was colonized first, followed by Cyprus and the coasts of Thrace, the Sea of Marmara and south coast of the Black Sea. Eventually, Greek colonization reached as far northeast as present-day Ukraine and Russia (Taganrog). To the west the coasts of Illyria, Southern Italy (called ""Magna Graecia"") were settled, followed by Southern France, Corsica, and even eastern Spain. Greek colonies were also founded in Egypt and Libya. Modern Syracuse, Naples, Marseille and Istanbul had their beginnings as the Greek colonies Syracusae (Συράκουσαι), Neapolis (Νεάπολις), Massalia (Μασσαλία) and Byzantion (Βυζάντιον). These colonies played an important role in the spread of Greek influence throughout Europe and also aided in the establishment of long-distance trading networks between the Greek city-states, boosting the economy of ancient Greece. Ancient Greece consisted of several hundred relatively independent city-states (poleis). This was a situation unlike that in most other contemporary societies, which were either tribal or kingdoms ruling over relatively large territories. Undoubtedly, the geography of Greece—divided and sub-divided by hills, mountains, and rivers—contributed to the fragmentary nature of ancient Greece. On the one hand, the ancient Greeks had no doubt that they were ""one people""; they had the same religion, same basic culture, and same language. Furthermore, the Greeks were very aware of their tribal origins; Herodotus was able to extensively categorise the city-states by tribe. Yet, although these higher-level relationships existed, they seem to have rarely had a major role in Greek politics. The independence of the poleis was fiercely defended; unification was something rarely contemplated by the ancient Greeks. Even when, during the second Persian invasion of Greece, a group of city-states allied themselves to defend Greece, the vast majority of poleis remained neutral, and after the Persian defeat, the allies quickly returned to infighting. Thus, the major peculiarities of the ancient Greek political system were its fragmented nature (and that this does not particularly seem to have tribal origin), and the particular focus on urban centers within otherwise tiny states. The peculiarities of the Greek system are further evidenced by the colonies that they set up throughout the Mediterranean, which, though they might count a certain Greek polis as their 'mother' (and remain sympathetic to her), were completely independent of the founding city. Inevitably smaller poleis might be dominated by larger neighbors, but conquest or direct rule by another city-state appears to have been quite rare. Instead the poleis grouped themselves into leagues, membership of which was in a constant state of flux. Later in the Classical period, the leagues would become fewer and larger, be dominated by one city (particularly Athens, Sparta and Thebes); and often poleis would be compelled to join under threat of war (or as part of a peace treaty). Even after Philip II of Macedon conquered the heartlands of ancient Greece, he did not attempt to annex the territory or unify it into a new province, but compelled most of the poleis to join his own Corinthian League. Initially many Greek city-states seem to have been petty kingdoms; there was often a city official carrying some residual, ceremonial functions of the king (basileus), e.g., the archon basileus in Athens. However, by the Archaic period and the first historical consciousness, most had already become aristocratic oligarchies. It is unclear exactly how this change occurred. For instance, in Athens, the kingship had been reduced to a hereditary, lifelong chief magistracy (archon) by c. 1050 BC; by 753 BC this had become a decennial, elected archonship, and finally an annually elected archonship by 683 BC. Through each stage, more power would have been transferred to the aristocracy as a whole, and away from a single individual. Inevitably, the domination of politics and concomitant aggregation of wealth by small groups of families was apt to cause social unrest in many poleis. In many cities a tyrant (not in the modern sense of repressive autocracies), would at some point seize control and govern according to their own will; often a populist agenda would help sustain them in power. In a system wracked with class conflict, government by a 'strongman' was often the best solution. Athens fell under a tyranny in the second half of the 6th century BC. When this tyranny was ended, the Athenians founded the world's first democracy as a radical solution to prevent the aristocracy regaining power. A citizens' assembly (the Ecclesia), for the discussion of city policy, had existed since the reforms of Draco in 621 BC; all citizens were permitted to attend after the reforms of Solon (early 6th century), but the poorest citizens could not address the assembly or run for office. With the establishment of the democracy, the assembly became the de jure mechanism of government; all citizens had equal privileges in the assembly. However, non-citizens, such as metics (foreigners living in Athens) or slaves, had no political rights at all. After the rise of democracy in Athens, other city-states founded democracies. However, many retained more traditional forms of government. As so often in other matters, Sparta was a notable exception to the rest of Greece, ruled through the whole period by not one, but two hereditary monarchs. This was a form of diarchy. The Kings of Sparta belonged to the Agiads and the Eurypontids, descendants respectively of Eurysthenes and Procles. Both dynasties' founders were believed to be twin sons of Aristodemus, a Heraclid ruler. However, the powers of these kings were held in check by both a council of elders (the Gerousia) and magistrates specifically appointed to watch over the kings (the Ephors). Only free, land-owning, native-born men could be citizens entitled to the full protection of the law in a city-state. In most city-states, unlike the situation in Rome, social prominence did not allow special rights. Sometimes families controlled public religious functions, but this ordinarily did not give any extra power in the government. In Athens, the population was divided into four social classes based on wealth. People could change classes if they made more money. In Sparta, all male citizens were called homoioi, meaning ""peers"". However, Spartan kings, who served as the city-state's dual military and religious leaders, came from two families. Women in Ancient Greece appear to have primarily performed domestic tasks, managed households, and borne and reared children. Slaves had no power or status. Slaves had the right to have a family and own property, subject to their master's goodwill and permission, but they had no political rights. By 600 BC, chattel slavery had spread in Greece. By the 5th century BC, slaves made up one-third of the total population in some city-states. Between 40 and 80% of the population of Classical Athens were slaves. Slaves outside of Sparta almost never revolted because they were made up of too many nationalities and were too scattered to organize. However, unlike later Western culture, the ancient Greeks did not think in terms of race. Most families owned slaves as household servants and laborers, and even poor families might have owned a few slaves. Owners were not allowed to beat or kill their slaves. Owners often promised to free slaves in the future to encourage slaves to work hard. Unlike in Rome, freedmen did not become citizens. Instead, they were mixed into the population of metics, which included people from foreign countries or other city-states who were officially allowed to live in the state. City-states legally owned slaves. These public slaves had a larger measure of independence than slaves owned by families, living on their own and performing specialized tasks. In Athens, public slaves were trained to look out for counterfeit coinage, while temple slaves acted as servants of the temple's deity and Scythian slaves were employed in Athens as a police force corralling citizens to political functions. Sparta had a special type of slaves called helots. Helots were Messenians enslaved en masse during the Messenian Wars by the state and assigned to families where they were forced to stay. Helots raised food and did household chores so that women could concentrate on raising strong children while men could devote their time to training as hoplites. Their masters treated them harshly, and helots revolted against their masters several times. In 370/369 BC, as a result of Epaminondas' liberation of Messenia from Spartan rule, the helot system there came to an end and the helots won their freedom. However, it persisted in Laconia until the 2nd century BC. For most of Greek history, education was private, except in Sparta. During the Hellenistic period, some city-states established public schools. Only wealthy families could afford a teacher. Boys learned how to read, write and quote literature. They also learned to sing and play one musical instrument and were trained as athletes for military service. They studied not for a job but to become an effective citizen. Girls also learned to read, write and do simple arithmetic so they could manage the household. They almost never received education after childhood. Boys went to school at the age of seven, or went to the barracks, if they lived in Sparta. The three types of teachings were: grammatistes for arithmetic, kitharistes for music and dancing, and Paedotribae for sports. Boys from wealthy families attending the private school lessons were taken care of by a paidagogos, a household slave selected for this task who accompanied the boy during the day. Classes were held in teachers' private houses and included reading, writing, mathematics, singing, and playing the lyre and flute. When the boy became 12 years old the schooling started to include sports such as wrestling, running, and throwing discus and javelin. In Athens, some older youths attended academy for the finer disciplines such as culture, sciences, music, and the arts. The schooling ended at age 18, followed by military training in the army usually for one or two years. Some of Athens' greatest such schools included the Lyceum (the so-called Peripatetic school founded by Aristotle of Stageira) and the Platonic Academy (founded by Plato of Athens).

Ancient_Greek,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek,"Ancient Greek (Ἑλληνῐκή, Hellēnikḗ; [hellɛːnikɛ́ː]) includes the forms of the Greek language used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around 1500 BC to 300 BC. It is often roughly divided into the following periods: Mycenaean Greek (c. 1400–1200 BC), Dark Ages (c. 1200–800 BC), the Archaic or Homeric period (c. 800–500 BC), and the Classical period (c. 500–300 BC). Ancient Greek was the language of Homer and of fifth-century Athenian historians, playwrights, and philosophers. It has contributed many words to English vocabulary and has been a standard subject of study in educational institutions of the Western world since the Renaissance. This article primarily contains information about the Epic and Classical periods of the language, which are the best-attested periods and considered most typical of Ancient Greek. From the Hellenistic period (c. 300 BC), Ancient Greek was followed by Koine Greek, which is regarded as a separate historical stage, though its earliest form closely resembles Attic Greek, and its latest form approaches Medieval Greek, and Koine may be classified as Ancient Greek in a wider sense. There were several regional dialects of Ancient Greek; Attic Greek developed into Koine. Ancient Greek was a pluricentric language, divided into many dialects. The main dialect groups are Attic and Ionic, Aeolic, Arcadocypriot, and Doric, many of them with several subdivisions. Some dialects are found in standardized literary forms in literature, while others are attested only in inscriptions. There are also several historical forms. Homeric Greek is a literary form of Archaic Greek (derived primarily from Ionic and Aeolic) used in the epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey, and in later poems by other authors. Homeric Greek had significant differences in grammar and pronunciation from Classical Attic and other Classical-era dialects. The origins, early form and development of the Hellenic language family are not well understood because of a lack of contemporaneous evidence. Several theories exist about what Hellenic dialect groups may have existed between the divergence of early Greek-like speech from the common Proto-Indo-European language and the Classical period. They have the same general outline but differ in some of the detail. The only attested dialect from this period[a] is Mycenaean Greek, but its relationship to the historical dialects and the historical circumstances of the times imply that the overall groups already existed in some form. Scholars assume that major Ancient Greek period dialect groups developed not later than 1120 BC, at the time of the Dorian invasions—and that their first appearances as precise alphabetic writing began in the 8th century BC. The invasion would not be ""Dorian"" unless the invaders had some cultural relationship to the historical Dorians. The invasion is known to have displaced population to the later Attic-Ionic regions, who regarded themselves as descendants of the population displaced by or contending with the Dorians. The Greeks of this period believed there were three major divisions of all Greek people – Dorians, Aeolians, and Ionians (including Athenians), each with their own defining and distinctive dialects. Allowing for their oversight of Arcadian, an obscure mountain dialect, and Cypriot, far from the center of Greek scholarship, this division of people and language is quite similar to the results of modern archaeological-linguistic investigation. One standard formulation for the dialects is: West vs. non-West Greek is the strongest-marked and earliest division, with non-West in subsets of Ionic-Attic (or Attic-Ionic) and Aeolic vs. Arcadocypriot, or Aeolic and Arcado-Cypriot vs. Ionic-Attic. Often non-West is called 'East Greek'. Arcadocypriot apparently descended more closely from the Mycenaean Greek of the Bronze Age. Boeotian Greek had come under a strong Northwest Greek influence, and can in some respects be considered a transitional dialect, as exemplified in the poems of the Boeotian poet Pindar who wrote in Doric with a small Aeolic admixture. Thessalian likewise had come under Northwest Greek influence, though to a lesser degree. Pamphylian Greek, spoken in a small area on the southwestern coast of Anatolia and little preserved in inscriptions, may be either a fifth major dialect group, or it is Mycenaean Greek overlaid by Doric, with a non-Greek native influence. Regarding the speech of the ancient Macedonians diverse theories have been put forward, but the epigraphic activity and the archaeological discoveries in the Greek region of Macedonia during the last decades has brought to light documents, among which the first texts written in Macedonian, such as the Pella curse tablet, as Hatzopoulos and other scholars note. Based on the conclusions drawn by several studies and findings such as Pella curse tablet, Emilio Crespo and other scholars suggest that ancient Macedonian was a Northwest Doric dialect, which shares isoglosses with its neighboring Thessalian dialects spoken in northeastern Thessaly. Some have also suggested an Aeolic Greek classification. The Lesbian dialect was Aeolic. For example, fragments of the works of the poet Sappho from the island of Lesbos are in Aeolian. Most of the dialect sub-groups listed above had further subdivisions, generally equivalent to a city-state and its surrounding territory, or to an island. Doric notably had several intermediate divisions as well, into Island Doric (including Cretan Doric), Southern Peloponnesus Doric (including Laconian, the dialect of Sparta), and Northern Peloponnesus Doric (including Corinthian). All the groups were represented by colonies beyond Greece proper as well, and these colonies generally developed local characteristics, often under the influence of settlers or neighbors speaking different Greek dialects. After the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late 4th century BC, a new international dialect known as Koine or Common Greek developed, largely based on Attic Greek, but with influence from other dialects. This dialect slowly replaced most of the older dialects, although the Doric dialect has survived in the Tsakonian language, which is spoken in the region of modern Sparta. Doric has also passed down its aorist terminations into most verbs of Demotic Greek. By about the 6th century AD, the Koine had slowly metamorphosed into Medieval Greek. Phrygian is an extinct Indo-European language of West and Central Anatolia, which is considered by some linguists to have been closely related to Greek. Among Indo-European branches with living descendants, Greek is often argued to have the closest genetic ties with Armenian (see also Graeco-Armenian) and Indo-Iranian languages (see Graeco-Aryan). Ancient Greek differs from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) and other Indo-European languages in certain ways. In phonotactics, ancient Greek words could end only in a vowel or /n s r/; final stops were lost, as in γάλα ""milk"", compared with γάλακτος ""of milk"" (genitive). Ancient Greek of the classical period also differed in both the inventory and distribution of original PIE phonemes due to numerous sound changes, notably the following: The pronunciation of Ancient Greek was very different from that of Modern Greek. Ancient Greek had long and short vowels; many diphthongs; double and single consonants; voiced, voiceless, and aspirated stops; and a pitch accent. In Modern Greek, all vowels and consonants are short. Many vowels and diphthongs once pronounced distinctly are pronounced as /i/ (iotacism). Some of the stops and glides in diphthongs have become fricatives, and the pitch accent has changed to a stress accent. Many of the changes took place in the Koine Greek period. The writing system of Modern Greek, however, does not reflect all pronunciation changes. The examples below represent Attic Greek in the 5th century BC. Ancient pronunciation cannot be reconstructed with certainty, but Greek from the period is well documented, and there is little disagreement among linguists as to the general nature of the sounds that the letters represent. /oː/ raised to [uː], probably by the 4th century BC. Greek, like all of the older Indo-European languages, is highly inflected. It is highly archaic in its preservation of Proto-Indo-European forms. In ancient Greek, nouns (including proper nouns) have five cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative), three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and three numbers (singular, dual, and plural). Verbs have four moods (indicative, imperative, subjunctive, and optative) and three voices (active, middle, and passive), as well as three persons (first, second, and third) and various other forms. Verbs are conjugated through seven combinations of tenses and aspect (generally simply called ""tenses""): the present, future, and imperfect are imperfective in aspect; the aorist, present perfect, pluperfect and future perfect are perfective in aspect. Most tenses display all four moods and three voices, although there is no future subjunctive or imperative. Also, there is no imperfect subjunctive, optative or imperative. The infinitives and participles correspond to the finite combinations of tense, aspect, and voice. The indicative of past tenses adds (conceptually, at least) a prefix /e-/, called the augment. This was probably originally a separate word, meaning something like ""then"", added because tenses in PIE had primarily aspectual meaning. The augment is added to the indicative of the aorist, imperfect, and pluperfect, but not to any of the other forms of the aorist (no other forms of the imperfect and pluperfect exist). The two kinds of augment in Greek are syllabic and quantitative. The syllabic augment is added to stems beginning with consonants, and simply prefixes e (stems beginning with r, however, add er). The quantitative augment is added to stems beginning with vowels, and involves lengthening the vowel: Some verbs augment irregularly; the most common variation is e → ei. The irregularity can be explained diachronically by the loss of s between vowels, or that of the letter w, which affected the augment when it was word-initial. In verbs with a preposition as a prefix, the augment is placed not at the start of the word, but between the preposition and the original verb. For example, προσ(-)βάλλω (I attack) goes to προσέβαλoν in the aorist. However compound verbs consisting of a prefix that is not a preposition retain the augment at the start of the word: αὐτο(-)μολῶ goes to ηὐτομόλησα in the aorist. Following Homer's practice, the augment is sometimes not made in poetry, especially epic poetry. The augment sometimes substitutes for reduplication; see below. Almost all forms of the perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect reduplicate the initial syllable of the verb stem. (A few irregular forms of perfect do not reduplicate, whereas a handful of irregular aorists reduplicate.) The three types of reduplication are: Irregular duplication can be understood diachronically. For example, lambanō (root lab) has the perfect stem eilēpha (not *lelēpha) because it was originally slambanō, with perfect seslēpha, becoming eilēpha through compensatory lengthening. Reduplication is also visible in the present tense stems of certain verbs. These stems add a syllable consisting of the root's initial consonant followed by i. A nasal stop appears after the reduplication in some verbs. The earliest extant examples of ancient Greek writing (c. 1450 BC) are in the syllabic script Linear B. Beginning in the 8th century BC, however, the Greek alphabet became standard, albeit with some variation among dialects. Early texts are written in boustrophedon style, but left-to-right became standard during the classic period. Modern editions of ancient Greek texts are usually written with accents and breathing marks, interword spacing, modern punctuation, and sometimes mixed case, but these were all introduced later. The beginning of Homer's Iliad exemplifies the Archaic period of ancient Greek (see Homeric Greek for more details): Μῆνιν ἄειδε, θεά, Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκε, πολλὰς δ' ἰφθίμους ψυχὰς Ἄϊδι προΐαψεν ἡρώων, αὐτοὺς δὲ ἑλώρια τεῦχε κύνεσσιν οἰωνοῖσί τε πᾶσι· Διὸς δ' ἐτελείετο βουλή· ἐξ οὗ δὴ τὰ πρῶτα διαστήτην ἐρίσαντε Ἀτρεΐδης τε ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν καὶ δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς. The beginning of Apology by Plato exemplifies Attic Greek from the Classical period of ancient Greek. (The second line is the IPA, the third is transliterated into the Latin alphabet using a modern version of the Erasmian scheme.)

And yet, loosely speaking, nothing they have said is true. The study of Ancient Greek in European countries in addition to Latin occupied an important place in the syllabus from the Renaissance until the beginning of the 20th century. This was true as well in the United States, where many of the nation's Founders received a classically based education. Latin was emphasized in American colleges, but Greek also was required in the Colonial and Early National eras, and the study of ancient Greece became increasingly popular in the mid-to-late Nineteenth Century, the age of American philhellenism. In particular, female intellectuals of the era designated the mastering of ancient Greek as essential in becoming a ""woman of letters."" Ancient Greek is still taught as a compulsory or optional subject especially at traditional or elite schools throughout Europe, such as public schools and grammar schools in the United Kingdom. It is compulsory in the liceo classico in Italy, in the gymnasium in the Netherlands, in some classes in Austria, in klasična gimnazija (grammar school – orientation: classical languages) in Croatia, in classical studies in ASO in Belgium and it is optional in the humanities-oriented gymnasium in Germany, usually as a third language after Latin and English, from the age of 14 to 18. In 2006/07, 15,000 pupils studied ancient Greek in Germany according to the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, and 280,000 pupils studied it in Italy. It is a compulsory subject alongside Latin in the humanities branch of the Spanish Baccalaureate. Ancient Greek is taught at most major universities worldwide, often combined with Latin as part of the study of classics. In 2010 it was offered in three primary schools in the UK, to boost children's language skills, and was one of seven foreign languages which primary schools could teach 2014 as part of a major drive to boost education standards.[needs update] Ancient Greek is taught as a compulsory subject in all gymnasiums and lyceums in Greece. Starting in 2001, an annual international competition ""Exploring the Ancient Greek Language and Culture"" (Greek: Διαγωνισμός στην Αρχαία Ελληνική Γλώσσα και Γραμματεία) was run for upper secondary students through the Greek Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs, with Greek language and cultural organisations as co-organisers. It appears to have ceased in 2010, having failed to gain the recognition and acceptance of teachers. Modern authors rarely write in ancient Greek, though Jan Křesadlo wrote some poetry and prose in the language, and Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, some volumes of Asterix, and The Adventures of Alix have been translated into ancient Greek. Ὀνόματα Kεχιασμένα (Onomata Kechiasmena) is the first magazine of crosswords and puzzles in ancient Greek. Its first issue appeared in April 2015 as an annex to Hebdomada Aenigmatum. Alfred Rahlfs included a preface, a short history of the Septuagint text, and other front matter translated into ancient Greek in his 1935 edition of the Septuagint; Robert Hanhart also included the introductory remarks to the 2006 revised Rahlfs–Hanhart edition in the language as well. Akropolis World News reports weekly a summary of the most important news in ancient Greek. Ancient Greek is also used by organizations and individuals, mainly Greek, who wish to denote their respect, admiration or preference for the use of this language. This use is sometimes considered graphical, nationalistic or humorous. In any case, the fact that modern Greeks can still wholly or partly understand texts written in non-archaic forms of ancient Greek shows the affinity of the modern Greek language to its ancestral predecessor. Ancient Greek is often used in the coinage of modern technical terms in the European languages: see English words of Greek origin. Latinized forms of ancient Greek roots are used in many of the scientific names of species and in scientific terminology. Proto-Greek Mycenaean Ancient Koine Medieval Modern",Wiki
Andrology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrology,"Andrology (from Ancient Greek: ἀνήρ, anēr, genitive ἀνδρός, andros 'man' and -λογία, -logia) is a name for the medical specialty that deals with male health, particularly relating to the problems of the male reproductive system and urological problems that are unique to men. It is the parallel to gynecology, which deals with medical issues which are specific to female health, especially reproductive and urologic health. Andrology covers anomalies in the connective tissues pertaining to the genitalia, as well as changes in the volume of cells, such as in genital hypertrophy or macrogenitosomia. From reproductive and urologic viewpoints, male-specific medical and surgical procedures include vasectomy, vasovasostomy (one of the vasectomy reversal procedures), orchidopexy, circumcision, sperm/semen cryopreservation, surgical sperm retrieval, semen analysis (for fertility or post-vasectomy), sperm preparation for assisted reproductive technology (ART) as well as intervention to deal with male genitourinary disorders such as the following: Unlike gynaecology, which has a plethora of medical board certification programs worldwide, andrology has none. Andrology has only been studied as a distinct specialty since the late 1960s: the first specialist journal on the subject was the German periodical Andrologie (now called Andrologia), published from 1969 onwards. The next specialty journal covering both the basic and clinical andrology was the International Journal of Andrology, established in 1978, which became the official journal of the European Academy of Andrology in 1992. In 1980 the American Society of Andrology launched the Journal of Andrology. In 2012, these two society journals merged into one premier journal in the field, named Andrology, with the first issue published in January 2013.",Wiki
Anesthesiology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiology,"Anesthesiology, anaesthesiology or anaesthesia is the medical specialty concerned with the total perioperative care of patients before, during and after surgery. It encompasses anesthesia, intensive care medicine, critical emergency medicine, and pain medicine. A physician specialized in anesthesiology is called an anesthesiologist, anaesthesiologist, or anaesthetist, depending on the country. In some countries, the terms are synonymous, while in other countries, they refer to different positions and anesthetist is only used for non-physicians, such as nurse anesthetists. The core element of the specialty is the prevention and mitigation of pain and distress using various anesthetic agents, as well as the monitoring and maintenance of a patient's vital functions throughout the perioperative period. Since the 19th century, anesthesiology has developed from an experimental area with non-specialist practitioners using novel, untested drugs and techniques into what is now a highly refined, safe and effective field of medicine. In some countries anesthesiologists comprise the largest single cohort of doctors in hospitals, and their role can extend far beyond the traditional role of anesthesia care in the operating room, including fields such as providing pre-hospital emergency medicine, running intensive care units, transporting critically ill patients between facilities, management of hospice and palliative care units, and prehabilitation programs to optimize patients for surgery. As a specialty, the core element of anesthesiology is the practice of anesthesia. This comprises the use of various injected and inhaled medications to produce a loss of sensation in patients, making it possible to carry out procedures that would otherwise cause intolerable pain or be technically unfeasible. Safe anesthesia requires in-depth knowledge of various invasive and non-invasive organ support techniques that are used to control patients' vital functions while under the effects of anaesthetic drugs; these include advanced airway management, invasive and non-invasive hemodynamic monitors, and diagnostic techniques like ultrasonography and echocardiography. Anesthesiologists are expected to have expert knowledge of human physiology, medical physics, and pharmacology as well as a broad general knowledge of all areas of medicine and surgery in all ages of patients, with a particular focus on those aspects which may impact on a surgical procedure. In recent decades, the role of anesthesiologists has broadened to focus not just on administering anesthetics during the surgical procedure itself, but also beforehand in order to identify high-risk patients and optimize their fitness, during the procedure to maintain situational awareness of the surgery itself so as to improve safety, and afterwards to promote and enhance recovery. This has been termed ""perioperative medicine"". The concept of intensive care medicine arose in the 1950s and 1960s, with anesthesiologists taking organ support techniques that had traditionally been used only for short periods during surgical procedures (such as positive pressure ventilation) and applying these therapies to patients with organ failure, who might require vital function support for extended periods until the effects of the illness could be reversed. The first intensive care unit was opened by Bjørn Aage Ibsen in Copenhagen in 1953, prompted by a polio epidemic during which many patients required prolonged artificial ventilation. In many countries, intensive care medicine is considered to be a subspecialty of anesthesiology, and anesthesiologists often rotate between duties in the operating room and the intensive care unit. This allows continuity of care when patients are admitted to the ICU after their surgery, and it also means that anesthesiologists can maintain their expertise at invasive procedures and vital function support in the controlled setting of the operating room, while then applying those skills in the more dangerous setting of the critically ill patient. In other countries, intensive care medicine has evolved further to become a separate medical specialty in its own right, or has become a ""supra-specialty"" which may be practiced by doctors from various base specialties such as anesthesiology, emergency medicine, general medicine, surgery or neurology. Anesthesiologists have key roles in major trauma, resuscitation, airway management, and caring for other patients outside the operating theatre who have critical emergencies that pose an immediate threat to life, again reflecting transferable skills from the operating room, and allowing continuity of care when patients are brought for surgery or intensive care. This branch of anesthesiology is collectively termed critical emergency medicine, and includes provision of pre-hospital emergency medicine as part of air ambulance or emergency medical services, as well as safe transfer of critically ill patients from one part of a hospital to another, or between healthcare facilities. Anesthesiologists commonly form part of cardiac arrest teams and rapid response teams composed of senior clinicians that are immediately summoned when a patient's heart stops beating, or when they deteriorate acutely while in hospital. Different models for emergency medicine exist internationally: in the Anglo-American model, the patient is rapidly transported by non-physician providers to definitive care such as an emergency department in a hospital. Conversely, the Franco-German approach has a physician, often an anesthesiologist, come to the patient and provide stabilizing care in the field. The patient is then triaged directly to the appropriate department of a hospital. The role of anesthesiologists in ensuring adequate pain relief for patients in the immediate postoperative period as well as their expertise in regional anesthesia and nerve blocks has led to the development of pain medicine as a subspecialty in its own right. The field comprises individualized strategies for all forms of analgesia, including pain management during childbirth, neuromodulatory technological methods such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation or implanted spinal cord stimulators, and specialized pharmacological regimens. Anesthesiologists often perform interhospital transfers of critically ill patients, both on short range helicopter or ground based missions, as well as longer range national transports to specialized centra or international missions to retrieve citizens injured abroad. Ambulance services employ units staffed by anesthesiologists that can be called out to provide advanced airway management, blood transfusion, thoracotomy, ECMO, and ultrasound capabilities outside the hospital. Anesthesiologists often (along with general surgeons and orthopedic surgeons) make up part of military medical teams to provide anesthesia and intensive care to trauma victims during armed conflicts. Various names and spellings are used to describe this specialty and the individuals who practice it in different parts of the world. In North America, the specialty is referred to as anesthesiology (omitting the ""ae"" diphthong), and a physician of that specialty is therefore called an anesthesiologist. In these countries, the term anesthestist is used to refer to non-physician providers of anesthesia services such as certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) and anesthesiologist assistants (AAs). In other countries – such as United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa – the medical specialty is referred to as anaesthesia or anaesthetics, with the ""ae"" diphthong. Contrary to the terminology in North America, anaesthetist is used only to refer to a physician practicing in the field; non-physicians use other titles such as physician assistant. At this time, the spelling anaesthesiology is most commonly used in written English, and a physician practicing in the field is termed an anaesthesiologist. This is the spelling adopted by the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists and the European Society of Anaesthesiology, as well as the majority of their member societies. It is the also the most commonly used spelling found in the titles of medical journals. In fact, many countries, such as Ireland and Hong Kong, which formerly used anaesthesia and anaesthetist have now transitioned to anaesthesiology and anaesthesiologist. Throughout human history, efforts have been made by almost every civilization to mitigate pain associated with surgical procedures, ranging from techniques such as acupuncture or phlebotomy to administration of substances such as mandrake, opium, or alcohol. However, by the mid-nineteenth century the study and administration of anesthesia had become far more complex as physicians began experimenting with compounds such as chloroform and nitrous oxide, albeit with mixed results. On October 16, 1846, a day that would thereafter be referred to as ""Ether Day"", in the Bullfinch Auditorium at Massachusetts General Hospital, which would later be nicknamed the ""Ether Dome"", New England Dentist William Morton successfully demonstrated the use of diethyl ether using an inhaler of his own design to induce general anesthesia for a patient undergoing removal of a neck tumor. Reportedly, following the quick procedure, operating surgeon John Warren affirmed to the audience that had gathered to watch the exhibition, ""Gentlemen, this is no humbug!"", although this report has been disputed. The term Anaesthesia was first used by the Greek philosopher Dioscorides, derived from the Ancient Greek roots ἀν- an-, ""not"", αἴσθησις aísthēsis, ""sensation"" to describe the insensibility that accompanied the narcotic-like effect produced by the mandrake plant. However, following Morton's successful exhibition, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. sent a letter to Morton in which he first to suggested anesthesia to denote the medically induced state of amnesia, insensibility, and stupor that enabled physicians to operate with minimal pain or trauma to the patient. The original term had simply been ""etherization"" because at the time this was the only agent discovered that was capable of inducing such a state. Over the next one hundred-plus years the specialty of anesthesiology developed rapidly as further scientific advancements meant that physicians' means of controlling peri-operative pain and monitoring patients' vital functions grew more sophisticated. With the isolation of cocaine in the mid-nineteenth century there began to be drugs available for local anesthesia. By the end of the nineteenth century, the number of pharmacological options had increased and had begun to be applied both peripherally and neuraxially. Then in the twentieth century neuromuscular blockade allowed the anesthesiologist to completely paralyze the patient pharmacologically and breathe for him or her via mechanical ventilation. With these new tools, the anesthetist could intensively manage the patient's physiology, bringing about critical care medicine, which, in many countries, is intimately connected to anesthesiology. Historically anesthesia providers were almost solely utilized during surgery to administer general anesthesia in which a person is placed in a pharmacologic coma. This is performed to permit surgery without the individual responding to pain (analgesia) during surgery or remembering (amnesia) the surgery. Effective practice of anesthesiology requires several areas of knowledge by the practitioner, some of which are: Many procedures or diagnostic tests do not require ""general anesthesia"" and can be performed using various forms of sedation or regional anesthesia, which can be performed to induce analgesia in a region of the body. For example, epidural administration of a local anesthetic is commonly performed on the mother during childbirth to reduce labor pain while permitting the mother to be awake and active in labor and delivery. In the United States, anesthesiologists may also perform non-surgical pain management (termed pain medicine) and provide care for patients in intensive care units (termed critical care medicine). International standards for the safe practice of anesthesia, jointly endorsed by the World Health Organization and the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists, define anesthesiologist as a graduate of a medical school who has completed a nationally recognized specialist anesthesia training program. The length and format of anesthesiology training programs varies from country to country, as noted below. A candidate must first have completed medical school training to be awarded a medical degree, before embarking on a program of postgraduate specialist training or residency which can range from four to nine years. Anesthesiologists in training spend this time gaining experience in various different subspecialties of anesthesiology and undertake various advanced postgraduate examinations and skill assessments. These lead to the award of a specialist qualification at the end of their training indicating that they are an expert in the field and may be licensed to practice independently. In Argentina, specialized training in the field of anesthesiology is overseen by the Argentine Federation of Associations of Anaesthesia, Analgesia and Reanimation (in Spanish, Federación Argentina de Asociaciones de Anestesia, Analgesia y Reanimación or FAAAAR). Residency programs are four to five years long. In Australia and New Zealand, the medical specialty is referred to as anaesthesia or anaesthetics; note the extra ""a"" (or diphthong). Specialist training is supervised by the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA), while anaesthetists are represented by the Australian Society of Anaesthetists and the New Zealand Society of Anaesthetists. The ANZCA-approved training course encompasses an initial two-year long Pre-vocational Medical Education and Training (PMET), which may include up to 12 months training in anaesthesia or ICU medicine, plus at least five years of supervised clinical training at approved training sites. Trainees must pass both the primary and final examinations which consist of both written (multiple choice questions and short-answer questions) and, if successful in the written exams, oral examinations (viva voce).[citation needed] In the final written examination, there are many questions of clinical scenarios (including interpretation of radiological exams, EKGs and other special investigations). There are also two cases of real patients with complex medical conditions – for clinical examination and a following discussion. The course has a program of 12 modules such as obstetric anaesthesia, pediatric anaesthesia, cardiothoracic and vascular anaesthesia, neurosurgical anaesthesia and pain management. Trainees also have to complete an advanced project, such as a research publication or paper. They also undergo an EMAC (Effective Management of Anaesthetic Crises) or EMST (Early Management of Severe Trauma) course. On completion of training, the trainees are awarded the Diploma of Fellowship and are entitled to use the qualification of FANZCA – Fellow of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists. In Brazil, anesthesiology training is overseen by the National Commission for Medical Residency (CNRM) and the Brazilian Society of Anesthesiology (SBA). Approximately 650 physicians[citation needed] are admitted yearly to a three-year specialization program with a duty hour limit of 60 hours per week. The residency programs can take place at training centers in university hospitals. These training centers are accredited by the Brazilian Society of Anesthesiology (SBA), or other referral hospitals accredited by the Ministry of Health. Most of the residents are trained in different areas, including ICU, pain management, and anesthesiology sub-specialties, including transplants and pediatrics. Residents may elect to pursue further specialization via a fellowship post-residency, but this is optional and only offered at few training centers. In order to be a certified anesthesiologist in Brazil, the residents must undergo exams (conducted by the SBA) throughout the residency program and at the end of the program. In order to be an instructor of a residency program certified by the SBA, the anesthesiologists must have the superior title in anaesthesia, in which the specialist undergoes a multiple choice test followed by an oral examination conducted by a board assigned by the national society.[citation needed] In Canada, training is supervised by 17 universities approved by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. Residency programs are typically five years long, consisting of 1.5 years of general medicine training followed by 3.5 years of anesthesia specific training. Canada, like the United States, uses a competency-based curriculum along with an evaluation method called ""Entrustable Professional Activities"" or ""EPA"" in which a resident is assessed based on their ability to perform certain tasks that are specific to the field of anesthesiology. Upon completion of a residency program, the candidate is required to pass a comprehensive objective examination consisting of a written component (two three-hour papers: one featuring 'multiple choice' questions, and the other featuring 'short-answer' questions) and an oral component (a two-hour session relating to topics on the clinical aspects of anesthesiology). The examination of a patient is not required. Upon completion of training, the anaesthesia graduate is then entitled to become a ""Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Canada"" and to use the post-nominal letters ""FRCPC"". In Germany, after earning the right to practice medicine (German: Approbation), German physicians who want to become anaesthesiologists must undergo five years of additional training as outlined by the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Anästhesiologie und Intensivmedizin, or DGAI). This specialist training consists of anaesthesiology, emergency medicine, intensive care and pain medicine, and also palliative care medicine. Similar to many other countries, the training includes rotations serving in the operation theatres to perform anaesthesia on a variety of patients being treated by various surgical subspecialties (e.g. general surgery, neurosurgery, invasive urological and gynecological procedures), followed by a rotation through various intensive-care units. Many German anaesthesiologists choose to complete an additional curriculum in emergency medicine, which once completed, enables them to be referred to as Notarzt [de], an emergency physician working pre-clinically with the emergency medical service. In pre-clinical settings the emergency physician is assisted by paramedics. In the Netherlands, anaesthesiologists must complete medical school training, which takes six years. After successfully completing medical school training, they start a five-year residency training in anaesthesiology. In their fifth year they can choose to spend the year doing research, or to specialize in a certain area, including general anaesthesiology, critical care medicine, pain and palliative medicine, paediatric anaesthesiology, cardiothoracic anaesthesiology, neuroanaesthesiology or obstetric anaesthesiology. In Guatemala, a student with a medical degree must complete a residency of 4 years. This consists of 3 years in residency and one year of supervised practice with an expert anaesthesiologist. After residency, students take a board examination conducted by the college of medicine of Guatemala, the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala (Medicine Faculty Examination Board), and a chief physician who represents the health care ministry of the government of Guatemala. The examination includes a written section, an oral section, and a special examination of skills and knowledge relating to anaesthetic instruments, emergency treatment, pre-operative care, post-operative care, intensive care units, and pain medicine. After passing the examination, the college of medicine of Guatemala, Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala and the health care ministry of the government of Guatemala grants the candidate a special license to practice anaesthesia as well as a diploma issued by the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala granting the degree of physician with specialization in anaesthesia. Anaesthetists in Guatemala are also subject to yearly examinations and mandatory participation in yearly seminars on the latest developments in anaesthetic practice. To be qualified as an anesthesiologist in Hong Kong, medical practitioners must undergo a minimum of six years of postgraduate training and pass three professional examinations. Upon completion of training, the Fellowship of Hong Kong College of Anesthesiologists and subsequently the Fellowship of Hong Kong Academy of Medicine is awarded. Practicing anesthesiologists are required to register in the Specialist register of the Medical Council of Hong Kong and hence are under the regulation of the Medical Council. In Italy, a medical school graduate must complete an accredited five-year residency in anesthesiology.[citation needed] Anesthesia training is overseen by the Italian Society of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI). In Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, anesthesiologists' training is supervised by the respective national societies of anesthesiology as well as the Scandinavian Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine. In the Nordic countries, anesthesiology is the medical specialty that is engaged in the fields of anesthesia, intensive care medicine, pain control medicine, pre-hospital and in-hospital emergency medicine. Medical school graduates must complete a twelve-month internship, followed by a five-year residency program. SSAI currently hosts six training programs for anesthesiologists in the Nordics. These are Intensive care, Pediatric anesthesiology and intensive care, Advanced pain medicine, Critical care medicine, Critical emergency medicine, and Advanced obstetric anesthesiology. In Sweden one speciality entails both anesthesiology and intensive care, i.e. one cannot become and anesthetist without also becoming an intensivist and vice versa. The Swedish Board of Health and Welfare regulates specialization for medical doctors in the country and defines the speciality of anesthesiology and intensive care as being: ""[…] characterized by a cross-professional approach and entailing A medical doctor can enter training as a resident in anesthesiology and intensive care after obtaining a license to practice medicine, following an 18–24 month internship. The residency program then lasts at least five years, not including the internship. See also Residency (medicine), Sweden. In the United Kingdom, training is supervised by the Royal College of Anaesthetists. Following the completion of medical school training, doctors enter a two-year foundation program that consists of at least six, four-month rotations in various medical specialties. It is mandatory for all physicians to complete a minimum of three months of general medicine and general surgery training during this time. Following the foundation program, physicians compete for specialist training. The training program in the United Kingdom currently consists of three years of core training and four years of higher training. Before the end of core training, all trainees must have passed the primary examination for the diploma of Fellowship of the Royal College of Anaesthetists (FRCA). Trainees wishing to hold dual accreditation in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine may enter anaesthesia training via the Acute Care Common Stem (ACCS) program which lasts four years and consists of experience in anaesthesia, emergency medicine, acute medicine and intensive care. Trainees in anaesthesia are called Specialty Registrars (StR) or Specialist Registrars (SpR). The Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT) in anaesthesia is divided into three levels: Basic, intermediate and advanced. During this time, physicians learn anaesthesia as applicable to all surgical specialties. The curriculum focuses on a modular format, with trainees primarily working in one special area during one module, for example: cardiac anaesthesia, neuroanaesthesia, ENT, maxillofacial, pain medicine, intensive care, and trauma. Traditionally (before the advent of the foundation program), trainees entered anaesthesia from other specialties, such as medicine or accidents and emergencies. Specialist training takes at least seven years. On completion of specialist training, physicians are awarded CCT and are eligible for entry on the GMC Specialist register and are also able to work as consultant anaesthetist. A new consultant in anaesthetics must have completed a minimum of 14 years of training (including: five to six years of medical school training, two years of foundation training, and seven years of anaesthesia training). Those wishing for dual accreditation (in Intensive care and anaesthesia) are required to undergo approximately an additional year of training and also complete the fellowship of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine (FFICM). Pain specialists give the Fellowship of the Faculty of Pain Medicine of the Royal College of Anaesthetists (FFPMRCA) examination. Following medical school training, anesthesiology residency programs in the United States require successful completion of an intern year plus three years of advanced residency training at an ACGME approved program (for a total of four years) for board certification eligibility in the specialty of anesthesiology. Anesthesiology residents face multiple examinations during their residency, including exams encompassing physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, and other medical sciences addressed in medical school, along with multiple anesthesia knowledge tests which assess progress during residency. Successful completion of both a written and oral board exam after completion of residency is required for board certification. Residency training in the U.S. encompasses the full scope of perioperative medicine, including pre-operative medical evaluation, management of pre-existing disease in the surgical patient, intraoperative life support, intraoperative pain control, intraoperative ventilation, post-operative recovery, intensive care medicine, and chronic and acute pain management. After residency, many anesthesiologists complete an additional fellowship year of sub-specialty training in areas such as pain management, sleep medicine, cardiothoracic anesthesiology, pediatric anesthesiology, neuroanesthesiology, regional anesthesiology/ambulatory anesthesiology, obstetric anesthesiology, or critical care medicine. The majority of anesthesiologists in the United States are board-certified, either by the American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) or the American Osteopathic Board of Anesthesiology (AOBA). Osteopathic physician anesthesiologists can be certified by the ABA. The ABA is a member of the American Board of Medical Specialties, while the AOBA falls under the American Osteopathic Association. Both Boards are recognized by the major insurance underwriters in the U.S. as well as by all branches of the U.S. Uniformed Services. Board certification by the ABA involves both a written and an oral examination. AOBA certification requires the same exams, in addition to a practical examination with examining physicians observing the applicant actually administering anesthetics in the operating room. There are several non-physician anesthesia providers practicing in the United States. These include certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), anesthesiologist assistants (AAs), and dental anesthesiologists. CRNAs are the only type of non-physician anesthesia provider that have successfully lobbied for the ability to provide all types of anesthesia for any surgery or procedure independently in some states.[citation needed] AAs must work under the supervision of an anesthesiologist, and dental anesthesiologists are limited to dental cases.",Wiki
Angiology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiology,"Angiology (from Greek ἀγγεῖον, angeīon, ""vessel""; and -λογία, -logia) is the medical specialty dedicated to studying the circulatory system and of the lymphatic system, i.e., arteries, veins and lymphatic vessels. In the UK, this field is more often termed angiology, and in the United States the term vascular medicine is more frequent. The field of vascular medicine (angiology) is the field that deals with preventing, diagnosing, and treating lymphatic and blood vessel related diseases. Arterial diseases include the aorta (aneurysms/dissection) and arteries supplying the legs, hands, kidneys, brain, intestines. It also covers arterial thrombosis and embolism; vasculitides; and vasospastic disorders. Naturally, it deals with preventing cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke. Venous diseases include venous thrombosis, chronic venous insufficiency, and varicose veins. Lymphatic diseases include primary and secondary forms of lymphedema. It also involves modification of risk factors for vascular disease like high cholesterol, high blood pressure. Cardiovascular risk factors such high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol and others fall under the specialty of vascular medicine. Vascular medicine (angiology) training is well established in some European countries. The first European educational Working Group was born in 1991 in Milan (EWMA) becoming in 1998 a European Scientific Association VAS Vascular Independent Research and Education European Organization with several European educational programmes: European Fellowship, European Master, CESMA-UEMS European Diploma and Postgrad Courses. In the United States there are several independent vascular medicine training programs and twelve NIH funded three-year programs as well. These programs are suitable for either Internal medicine specialists as a fellowship or for cardiologists. In 2005, the first vascular medicine boards were administered by the American Board of Vascular Medicine. For current education and training in vascular medicine, see Society for Vascular Medicine.",Wiki
Animal,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal,"Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia (/ˌænɪˈmeɪliə/). With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Animals form a clade, meaning that they arose from a single common ancestor. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described, of which around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates. It has been estimated there are as many as 7.77 million animal species on Earth. Animal body lengths range from 8.5 μm (0.00033 in) to 33.6 m (110 ft). They have complex ecologies and interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology, and the study of animal behaviour is known as ethology. The animal kingdom is divided into five infrakingdoms/superphyla, namely Porifera, Ctenophora, Placozoa, Cnidaria and Bilateria. Most living animal species belong to the infrakingdom Bilateria, a highly proliferative clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric and significantly cephalised body plan, and the vast majority of bilaterians belong to two large superphyla: the protostomes, which includes organisms such as arthropods, molluscs, flatworms, annelids and nematodes; and the deuterostomes, which include echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates, the latter of which contains the vertebrates. The much smaller basal phylum Xenacoelomorpha have an uncertain position within Bilateria. Animals first appeared in the fossil record in the late Cryogenian period and diversified in the subsequent Ediacaran period in what is known as the Avalon explosion. Earlier evidence of animals is still controversial; the sponge-like organism Otavia has been dated back to the Tonian period at the start of the Neoproterozoic, but its identity as an animal is heavily contested. Nearly all modern animal phyla first appeared in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago (Mya), and most classes during the Ordovician radiation 485.4 Mya. Common to all living animals, 6,331 groups of genes have been identified that may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived about 650 Mya during the Cryogenian period. Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous with Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa. Humans make use of many other animal species for food (including meat, eggs, and dairy products), for materials (such as leather, fur, and wool), as pets and as working animals for transportation, and services. Dogs, the first domesticated animal, have been used in hunting, in security and in warfare, as have horses, pigeons and birds of prey; while other terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sports, trophies or profits. Non-human animals are also an important cultural element of human evolution, having appeared in cave arts and totems since the earliest times, and are frequently featured in mythology, religion, arts, literature, heraldry, politics, and sports. The word animal comes from the Latin noun animal of the same meaning, which is itself derived from Latin animalis 'having breath or soul'. The biological definition includes all members of the kingdom Animalia. In colloquial usage, the term animal is often used to refer only to nonhuman animals. The term metazoa is derived from Ancient Greek μετα meta 'after' (in biology, the prefix meta- stands for 'later') and ζῷᾰ zōia 'animals', plural of ζῷον zōion 'animal'. Animals have several characteristics that they share with other living things. Animals are eukaryotic, multicellular, and aerobic, as are plants and fungi. Unlike plants and algae, which produce their own food, animals cannot produce their own food a feature they share with fungi. Animals ingest organic material and digest it internally. Animals have structural characteristics that set them apart from all other living things: Typically, there is an internal digestive chamber with either one opening (in Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and flatworms) or two openings (in most bilaterians). Animal development is controlled by Hox genes, which signal the times and places to develop structures such as body segments and limbs. During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised into specialised tissues and organs, making the formation of complex structures possible, and allowing cells to be differentiated. The extracellular matrix may be calcified, forming structures such as shells, bones, and spicules. In contrast, the cells of other multicellular organisms (primarily algae, plants, and fungi) are held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth. Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction. They produce haploid gametes by meiosis; the smaller, motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger, non-motile gametes are ova. These fuse to form zygotes, which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere, called a blastula. In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location, attach to the seabed, and develop into a new sponge. In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement. It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers, an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm. In most cases, a third germ layer, the mesoderm, also develops between them. These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs. Repeated instances of mating with a close relative during sexual reproduction generally leads to inbreeding depression within a population due to the increased prevalence of harmful recessive traits. Animals have evolved numerous mechanisms for avoiding close inbreeding. Some animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent. This may take place through fragmentation; budding, such as in Hydra and other cnidarians; or parthenogenesis, where fertile eggs are produced without mating, such as in aphids. Animals are categorised into ecological groups depending on their trophic levels and how they consume organic material. Such groupings include carnivores (further divided into subcategories such as piscivores, insectivores, ovivores, etc.), herbivores (subcategorised into folivores, graminivores, frugivores, granivores, nectarivores, algivores, etc.), omnivores, fungivores, scavengers/detritivores, and parasites. Interactions between animals of each biome form complex food webs within that ecosystem. In carnivorous or omnivorous species, predation is a consumer–resource interaction where the predator feeds on another organism, its prey, who often evolves anti-predator adaptations to avoid being fed upon. Selective pressures imposed on one another lead to an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey, resulting in various antagonistic/competitive coevolutions. Almost all multicellular predators are animals. Some consumers use multiple methods; for example, in parasitoid wasps, the larvae feed on the hosts' living tissues, killing them in the process, but the adults primarily consume nectar from flowers. Other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours, such as hawksbill sea turtles which mainly eat sponges. Most animals rely on biomass and bioenergy produced by plants and phytoplanktons (collectively called producers) through photosynthesis. Herbivores, as primary consumers, eat the plant material directly to digest and absorb the nutrients, while carnivores and other animals on higher trophic levels indirectly acquire the nutrients by eating the herbivores or other animals that have eaten the herbivores. Animals oxidise carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and other biomolecules, which allows the animal to grow and to sustain basal metabolism and fuel other biological processes such as locomotion. Some benthic animals living close to hydrothermal vents and cold seeps on the dark sea floor consume organic matter produced through chemosynthesis (via oxidising inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide) by archaea and bacteria. Animals evolved in the sea. Lineages of arthropods colonised land around the same time as land plants, probably between 510 and 471 million years ago during the Late Cambrian or Early Ordovician. Vertebrates such as the lobe-finned fish Tiktaalik started to move on to land in the late Devonian, about 375 million years ago. Animals occupy virtually all of earth's habitats and microhabitats, with faunas adapted to salt water, hydrothermal vents, fresh water, hot springs, swamps, forests, pastures, deserts, air, and the interiors of other organisms. Animals are however not particularly heat tolerant; very few of them can survive at constant temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F) or in the most extreme cold deserts of continental Antarctica. The collective global geomorphic influence of animals on the processes shaping the Earth's surface remains largely understudied, with most studies limited to individual species and well-known exemplars. The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is the largest animal that has ever lived, weighing up to 190 tonnes and measuring up to 33.6 metres (110 ft) long. The largest extant terrestrial animal is the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), weighing up to 12.25 tonnes and measuring up to 10.67 metres (35.0 ft) long. The largest terrestrial animals that ever lived were titanosaur sauropod dinosaurs such as Argentinosaurus, which may have weighed as much as 73 tonnes, and Supersaurus which may have reached 39 metres. Several animals are microscopic; some Myxozoa (obligate parasites within the Cnidaria) never grow larger than 20 μm, and one of the smallest species (Myxobolus shekel) is no more than 8.5 μm when fully grown. The following table lists estimated numbers of described extant species for the major animal phyla, along with their principal habitats (terrestrial, fresh water, and marine), and free-living or parasitic ways of life. Species estimates shown here are based on numbers described scientifically; much larger estimates have been calculated based on various means of prediction, and these can vary wildly. For instance, around 25,000–27,000 species of nematodes have been described, while published estimates of the total number of nematode species include 10,000–20,000; 500,000; 10 million; and 100 million. Using patterns within the taxonomic hierarchy, the total number of animal species—including those not yet described—was calculated to be about 7.77 million in 2011.[a] 3,000–6,500 4,000–25,000 Evidence of animals is found as long ago as the Cryogenian period. 24-Isopropylcholestane (24-ipc) has been found in rocks from roughly 650 million years ago; it is only produced by sponges and pelagophyte algae. Its likely origin is from sponges based on molecular clock estimates for the origin of 24-ipc production in both groups. Analyses of pelagophyte algae consistently recover a Phanerozoic origin, while analyses of sponges recover a Neoproterozoic origin, consistent with the appearance of 24-ipc in the fossil record. The first body fossils of animals appear in the Ediacaran, represented by forms such as Charnia and Spriggina. It had long been doubted whether these fossils truly represented animals, but the discovery of the animal lipid cholesterol in fossils of Dickinsonia establishes their nature. Animals are thought to have originated under low-oxygen conditions, suggesting that they were capable of living entirely by anaerobic respiration, but as they became specialised for aerobic metabolism they became fully dependent on oxygen in their environments. Many animal phyla first appear in the fossil record during the Cambrian explosion, starting about 539 million years ago, in beds such as the Burgess shale. Extant phyla in these rocks include molluscs, brachiopods, onychophorans, tardigrades, arthropods, echinoderms and hemichordates, along with numerous now-extinct forms such as the predatory Anomalocaris. The apparent suddenness of the event may however be an artefact of the fossil record, rather than showing that all these animals appeared simultaneously. That view is supported by the discovery of Auroralumina attenboroughii, the earliest known Ediacaran crown-group cnidarian (557–562 mya, some 20 million years before the Cambrian explosion) from Charnwood Forest, England. It is thought to be one of the earliest predators, catching small prey with its nematocysts as modern cnidarians do. Some palaeontologists have suggested that animals appeared much earlier than the Cambrian explosion, possibly as early as 1 billion years ago. Early fossils that might represent animals appear for example in the 665-million-year-old rocks of the Trezona Formation of South Australia. These fossils are interpreted as most probably being early sponges. Trace fossils such as tracks and burrows found in the Tonian period (from 1 gya) may indicate the presence of triploblastic worm-like animals, roughly as large (about 5 mm wide) and complex as earthworms. However, similar tracks are produced by the giant single-celled protist Gromia sphaerica, so the Tonian trace fossils may not indicate early animal evolution. Around the same time, the layered mats of microorganisms called stromatolites decreased in diversity, perhaps due to grazing by newly evolved animals. Objects such as sediment-filled tubes that resemble trace fossils of the burrows of wormlike animals have been found in 1.2 gya rocks in North America, in 1.5 gya rocks in Australia and North America, and in 1.7 gya rocks in Australia. Their interpretation as having an animal origin is disputed, as they might be water-escape or other structures. Animals are monophyletic, meaning they are derived from a common ancestor. Animals are the sister group to the choanoflagellates, with which they form the Choanozoa. Ros-Rocher and colleagues (2021) trace the origins of animals to unicellular ancestors, providing the external phylogeny shown in the cladogram. Uncertainty of relationships is indicated with dashed lines. The animal clade had certainly originated by 650 mya, and may have come into being as much as 800 mya, based on molecular clock evidence for different phyla. Holomycota (inc. fungi) Ichthyosporea Pluriformea Filasterea The relationships at the base of the animal tree have been debated. Other than Ctenophora, the Bilateria and Cnidaria are the only groups with symmetry, and other evidence shows they are closely related. In addition to sponges, Placozoa has no symmetry and was often considered a ""missing link"" between protists and multicellular animals. The presence of hox genes in Placozoa shows that they were once more complex. The Porifera (sponges) have long been assumed to be sister to the rest of the animals, but there is evidence that the Ctenophora may be in that position. Molecular phylogenetics has supported both the sponge-sister and ctenophore-sister hypotheses. In 2017, Roberto Feuda and colleagues, using amino acid differences, presented both, with the following cladogram for the sponge-sister view that they supported (their ctenophore-sister tree simply interchanging the places of ctenophores and sponges): Porifera Ctenophora Placozoa Cnidaria Bilateria Conversely, a 2023 study by Darrin Schultz and colleagues uses ancient gene linkages to construct the following ctenophore-sister phylogeny: Ctenophora Porifera Placozoa Cnidaria Bilateria Sponges are physically very distinct from other animals, and were long thought to have diverged first, representing the oldest animal phylum and forming a sister clade to all other animals. Despite their morphological dissimilarity with all other animals, genetic evidence suggests sponges may be more closely related to other animals than the comb jellies are. Sponges lack the complex organisation found in most other animal phyla; their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organised into distinct tissues, unlike all other animals. They typically feed by drawing in water through pores, filtering out small particles of food. The Ctenophora and Cnidaria are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening, which serves as both mouth and anus. Animals in both phyla have distinct tissues, but these are not organised into discrete organs. They are diploblastic, having only two main germ layers, ectoderm and endoderm. The tiny placozoans have no permanent digestive chamber and no symmetry; they superficially resemble amoebae. Their phylogeny is poorly defined, and under active research. The remaining animals, the great majority—comprising some 29 phyla and over a million species—form the Bilateria clade, which have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria are triploblastic, with three well-developed germ layers, and their tissues form distinct organs. The digestive chamber has two openings, a mouth and an anus, and in the Nephrozoa there is an internal body cavity, a coelom or pseudocoelom. These animals have a head end (anterior) and a tail end (posterior), a back (dorsal) surface and a belly (ventral) surface, and a left and a right side. A modern consensus phylogenetic tree for the Bilateria is shown below. Xenacoelomorpha Ambulacraria Chordata Ecdysozoa Spiralia Having a front end means that this part of the body encounters stimuli, such as food, favouring cephalisation, the development of a head with sense organs and a mouth. Many bilaterians have a combination of circular muscles that constrict the body, making it longer, and an opposing set of longitudinal muscles, that shorten the body; these enable soft-bodied animals with a hydrostatic skeleton to move by peristalsis. They also have a gut that extends through the basically cylindrical body from mouth to anus. Many bilaterian phyla have primary larvae which swim with cilia and have an apical organ containing sensory cells. However, over evolutionary time, descendant spaces have evolved which have lost one or more of each of these characteristics. For example, adult echinoderms are radially symmetric (unlike their larvae), while some parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures. Genetic studies have considerably changed zoologists' understanding of the relationships within the Bilateria. Most appear to belong to two major lineages, the protostomes and the deuterostomes. It is often suggested that the basalmost bilaterians are the Xenacoelomorpha, with all other bilaterians belonging to the subclade Nephrozoa. However, this suggestion has been contested, with other studies finding that xenacoelomorphs are more closely related to Ambulacraria than to other bilaterians. Protostomes and deuterostomes differ in several ways. Early in development, deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while many protostomes (the Spiralia) undergo spiral cleavage. Animals from both groups possess a complete digestive tract, but in protostomes the first opening of the embryonic gut develops into the mouth, and the anus forms secondarily. In deuterostomes, the anus forms first while the mouth develops secondarily. Most protostomes have schizocoelous development, where cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm. In deuterostomes, the mesoderm forms by enterocoelic pouching, through invagination of the endoderm. The main deuterostome phyla are the Ambulacraria and the Chordata. Ambulacraria are exclusively marine and include acorn worms, starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers. The chordates are dominated by the vertebrates (animals with backbones), which consist of fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The protostomes include the Ecdysozoa, named after their shared trait of ecdysis, growth by moulting, Among the largest ecdysozoan phyla are the arthropods and the nematodes. The rest of the protostomes are in the Spiralia, named for their pattern of developing by spiral cleavage in the early embryo. Major spiralian phyla include the annelids and molluscs. In the classical era, Aristotle divided animals,[d] based on his own observations, into those with blood (roughly, the vertebrates) and those without. The animals were then arranged on a scale from man (with blood, two legs, rational soul) down through the live-bearing tetrapods (with blood, four legs, sensitive soul) and other groups such as crustaceans (no blood, many legs, sensitive soul) down to spontaneously generating creatures like sponges (no blood, no legs, vegetable soul). Aristotle was uncertain whether sponges were animals, which in his system ought to have sensation, appetite, and locomotion, or plants, which did not: he knew that sponges could sense touch and would contract if about to be pulled off their rocks, but that they were rooted like plants and never moved about. In 1758, Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical classification in his Systema Naturae. In his original scheme, the animals were one of three kingdoms, divided into the classes of Vermes, Insecta, Pisces, Amphibia, Aves, and Mammalia. Since then, the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum, the Chordata, while his Insecta (which included the crustaceans and arachnids) and Vermes have been renamed or broken up. The process was begun in 1793 by Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck, who called the Vermes une espèce de chaos ('a chaotic mess')[e] and split the group into three new phyla: worms, echinoderms, and polyps (which contained corals and jellyfish). By 1809, in his Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck had created nine phyla apart from vertebrates (where he still had four phyla: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish) and molluscs, namely cirripedes, annelids, crustaceans, arachnids, insects, worms, radiates, polyps, and infusorians. In his 1817 Le Règne Animal, Georges Cuvier used comparative anatomy to group the animals into four embranchements ('branches' with different body plans, roughly corresponding to phyla), namely vertebrates, molluscs, articulated animals (arthropods and annelids), and zoophytes (radiata) (echinoderms, cnidaria and other forms). This division into four was followed by the embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer in 1828, the zoologist Louis Agassiz in 1857, and the comparative anatomist Richard Owen in 1860. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into two subkingdoms: Metazoa (multicellular animals, with five phyla: coelenterates, echinoderms, articulates, molluscs, and vertebrates) and Protozoa (single-celled animals), including a sixth animal phylum, sponges. The protozoa were later moved to the former kingdom Protista, leaving only the Metazoa as a synonym of Animalia. The human population exploits a large number of other animal species for food, both of domesticated livestock species in animal husbandry and, mainly at sea, by hunting wild species. Marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food. A smaller number of species are farmed commercially. Humans and their livestock make up more than 90% of the biomass of all terrestrial vertebrates, and almost as much as all insects combined. Invertebrates including cephalopods, crustaceans, insects—principally bees and silkworms—and bivalve or gastropod molluscs are hunted or farmed for food, fibres. Chickens, cattle, sheep, pigs, and other animals are raised as livestock for meat across the world. Animal fibres such as wool and silk are used to make textiles, while animal sinews have been used as lashings and bindings, and leather is widely used to make shoes and other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur to make items such as coats and hats. Dyestuffs including carmine (cochineal), shellac, and kermes have been made from the bodies of insects. Working animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the first days of agriculture. Animals such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster serve a major role in science as experimental models. Animals have been used to create vaccines since their discovery in the 18th century. Some medicines such as the cancer drug trabectedin are based on toxins or other molecules of animal origin. People have used hunting dogs to help chase down and retrieve animals, and birds of prey to catch birds and mammals, while tethered cormorants have been used to catch fish. Poison dart frogs have been used to poison the tips of blowpipe darts. A wide variety of animals are kept as pets, from invertebrates such as tarantulas, octopuses, and praying mantises, reptiles such as snakes and chameleons, and birds including canaries, parakeets, and parrots all finding a place. However, the most kept pet species are mammals, namely dogs, cats, and rabbits. There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own. A wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport. The signs of the Western and Chinese zodiacs are based on animals. In China and Japan, the butterfly has been seen as the personification of a person's soul, and in classical representation the butterfly is also the symbol of the soul. Animals have been the subjects of art from the earliest times, both historical, as in ancient Egypt, and prehistoric, as in the cave paintings at Lascaux. Major animal paintings include Albrecht Dürer's 1515 The Rhinoceros, and George Stubbs's c. 1762 horse portrait Whistlejacket. Insects, birds and mammals play roles in literature and film, such as in giant bug movies. Animals including insects and mammals feature in mythology and religion. The scarab beetle was sacred in ancient Egypt, and the cow is sacred in Hinduism. Among other mammals, deer, horses, lions, bats, bears, and wolves are the subjects of myths and worship.",Wiki
Animal_testing,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing,"This is an accepted version of this page Animal testing, also known as animal experimentation, animal research, and in vivo testing, is the use of non-human animals, such as model organisms, in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments or habitats. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments, and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to the industry. The focus of animal testing varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some questions of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research, and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, animal testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. Research using animal models has been central to most of the achievements of modern medicine. It has contributed to most of the basic knowledge in fields such as human physiology and biochemistry, and has played significant roles in fields such as neuroscience and infectious disease. The results have included the near-eradication of polio and the development of organ transplantation, and have benefited both humans and animals. From 1910 to 1927, Thomas Hunt Morgan's work with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster identified chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes, and Eric Kandel wrote that Morgan's discoveries ""helped transform biology into an experimental science"". Research in model organisms led to further medical advances, such as the production of the diphtheria antitoxin and the 1922 discovery of insulin and its use in treating diabetes, which had previously meant death. Modern general anaesthetics such as halothane were also developed through studies on model organisms, and are necessary for modern, complex surgical operations. Other 20th-century medical advances and treatments that relied on research performed in animals include organ transplant techniques, the heart-lung machine, antibiotics, and the whooping cough vaccine. Animal testing is widely used to aid in research of human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical. This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution. Performing experiments in model organisms allows for better understanding the disease process without the added risk of harming an actual human. The species of the model organism is usually chosen so that it reacts to disease or its treatment in a way that resembles human physiology as needed. Biological activity in a model organism does not ensure an effect in humans, and care must be taken when generalizing from one organism to another.[page needed] However, many drugs, treatments and cures for human diseases are developed in part with the guidance of animal models. Treatments for animal diseases have also been developed, including for rabies, anthrax, glanders, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), tuberculosis, Texas cattle fever, classical swine fever (hog cholera), heartworm, and other parasitic infections. Animal experimentation continues to be required for biomedical research, and is used with the aim of solving medical problems such as Alzheimer's disease, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, many headaches, and other conditions in which there is no useful in vitro model system available. The annual use of vertebrate animals—from zebrafish to non-human primates—was estimated at 192 million as of 2015. In the European Union, vertebrate species represent 93% of animals used in research, and 11.5 million animals were used there in 2011. The mouse (Mus musculus) is associated with many important biological discoveries of the 20th and 21st centuries, and by one estimate, the number of mice and rats used in the United States alone in 2001 was 80 million. In 2013, it was reported that mammals (mice and rats), fish, amphibians, and reptiles together accounted for over 85% of research animals. In 2022, a law was passed in the United States that eliminated the FDA requirement that all drugs be tested on animals. Animal testing is regulated to varying degrees in different countries. In some cases it is strictly controlled while others have more relaxed regulations. There are ongoing debates about the ethics and necessity of animal testing. Proponents argue that it has led to significant advancements in medicine and other fields while opponents raise concerns about cruelty towards animals and question its effectiveness and reliability. There are efforts underway to find alternatives to animal testing such as computer simulation models, organs-on-chips technology that mimics human organs for lab tests, microdosing techniques which involve administering small doses of test compounds to human volunteers instead of non-human animals for safety tests or drug screenings; positron emission tomography (PET) scans which allow scanning of the human brain without harming humans; comparative epidemiological studies among human populations; simulators and computer programs for teaching purposes; among others. The terms animal testing, animal experimentation, animal research, in vivo testing, and vivisection have similar denotations but different connotations. Literally, ""vivisection"" means ""live sectioning"" of an animal, and historically referred only to experiments that involved the dissection of live animals. The term is occasionally used to refer pejoratively to any experiment using living animals; for example, the Encyclopædia Britannica defines ""vivisection"" as: ""Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals"", although dictionaries point out that the broader definition is ""used only by people who are opposed to such work"". The word has a negative connotation, implying torture, suffering, and death. The word ""vivisection"" is preferred by those opposed to this research, whereas scientists typically use the term ""animal experimentation"". The following text excludes as much as possible practices related to in vivo veterinary surgery, which is left to the discussion of vivisection. The earliest references to animal testing are found in the writings of the Greeks in the 2nd and 4th centuries BCE. Aristotle and Erasistratus were among the first to perform experiments on living animals. Galen, a 2nd-century Roman physician, performed post-mortem dissections of pigs and goats. Avenzoar, a 12th-century Arabic physician in Moorish Spain introduced an experimental method of testing surgical procedures before applying them to human patients. Discoveries in the 18th and 19th centuries included Antoine Lavoisier's use of a guinea pig in a calorimeter to prove that respiration was a form of combustion, and Louis Pasteur's demonstration of the germ theory of disease in the 1880s using anthrax in sheep. Robert Koch used animal testing of mice and guinea pigs to discover the bacteria that cause anthrax and tuberculosis. In the 1890s, Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning. Research using animal models has been central to most of the achievements of modern medicine. It has contributed most of the basic knowledge in fields such as human physiology and biochemistry, and has played significant roles in fields such as neuroscience and infectious disease. For example, the results have included the near-eradication of polio and the development of organ transplantation, and have benefited both humans and animals. From 1910 to 1927, Thomas Hunt Morgan's work with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster identified chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes. Drosophila became one of the first, and for some time the most widely used, model organisms, and Eric Kandel wrote that Morgan's discoveries ""helped transform biology into an experimental science"". D. melanogaster remains one of the most widely used eukaryotic model organisms. During the same time period, studies on mouse genetics in the laboratory of William Ernest Castle in collaboration with Abbie Lathrop led to generation of the DBA (""dilute, brown and non-agouti"") inbred mouse strain and the systematic generation of other inbred strains. The mouse has since been used extensively as a model organism and is associated with many important biological discoveries of the 20th and 21st centuries. In the late 19th century, Emil von Behring isolated the diphtheria toxin and demonstrated its effects in guinea pigs. He went on to develop an antitoxin against diphtheria in animals and then in humans, which resulted in the modern methods of immunization and largely ended diphtheria as a threatening disease. The diphtheria antitoxin is famously commemorated in the Iditarod race, which is modeled after the delivery of antitoxin in the 1925 serum run to Nome. The success of animal studies in producing the diphtheria antitoxin has also been attributed as a cause for the decline of the early 20th-century opposition to animal research in the United States. Subsequent research in model organisms led to further medical advances, such as Frederick Banting's research in dogs, which determined that the isolates of pancreatic secretion could be used to treat dogs with diabetes. This led to the 1922 discovery of insulin (with John Macleod) and its use in treating diabetes, which had previously meant death. John Cade's research in guinea pigs discovered the anticonvulsant properties of lithium salts, which revolutionized the treatment of bipolar disorder, replacing the previous treatments of lobotomy or electroconvulsive therapy. Modern general anaesthetics, such as halothane and related compounds, were also developed through studies on model organisms, and are necessary for modern, complex surgical operations. In the 1940s, Jonas Salk used rhesus monkey studies to isolate the most virulent forms of the polio virus, which led to his creation of a polio vaccine. The vaccine, which was made publicly available in 1955, reduced the incidence of polio 15-fold in the United States over the following five years. Albert Sabin improved the vaccine by passing the polio virus through animal hosts, including monkeys; the Sabin vaccine was produced for mass consumption in 1963, and had virtually eradicated polio in the United States by 1965. It has been estimated that developing and producing the vaccines required the use of 100,000 rhesus monkeys, with 65 doses of vaccine produced from each monkey. Sabin wrote in 1992, ""Without the use of animals and human beings, it would have been impossible to acquire the important knowledge needed to prevent much suffering and premature death not only among humans, but also among animals."" On 3 November 1957, a Soviet dog, Laika, became the first of many animals to orbit the Earth. In the 1970s, antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were developed using armadillos, then given to humans. The ability of humans to change the genetics of animals took an enormous step forward in 1974 when Rudolf Jaenisch could produce the first transgenic mammal, by integrating DNA from simians into the genome of mice. This genetic research progressed rapidly and, in 1996, Dolly the sheep was born, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell. Other 20th-century medical advances and treatments that relied on research performed in animals include organ transplant techniques, the heart-lung machine, antibiotics, and the whooping cough vaccine. Treatments for animal diseases have also been developed, including for rabies, anthrax, glanders, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), tuberculosis, Texas cattle fever, classical swine fever (hog cholera), heartworm, and other parasitic infections. Animal experimentation continues to be required for biomedical research, and is used with the aim of solving medical problems such as Alzheimer's disease, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, many headaches, and other conditions in which there is no useful in vitro model system available. Toxicology testing became important in the 20th century. In the 19th century, laws regulating drugs were more relaxed. For example, in the US, the government could only ban a drug after they had prosecuted a company for selling products that harmed customers. However, in response to the Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster of 1937 in which the eponymous drug killed over 100 users, the US Congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs on animals before they could be marketed. Other countries enacted similar legislation. In the 1960s, in reaction to the Thalidomide tragedy, further laws were passed requiring safety testing on pregnant animals before a drug can be sold. Although many more invertebrates than vertebrates are used in animal testing, these studies are largely unregulated by law. The most frequently used invertebrate species are Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, and Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. In the case of C. elegans, the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known, while studies in the fly D. melanogaster can use an amazing array of genetic tools. These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in animal testing, including their short life cycle and the ease with which large numbers may be housed and studied. However, the lack of an adaptive immune system and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in several aspects of medical research such as vaccine development. Similarly, the fruit fly immune system differs greatly from that of humans, and diseases in insects can be different from diseases in vertebrates; however, fruit flies and waxworms can be useful in studies to identify novel virulence factors or pharmacologically active compounds. Several invertebrate systems are considered acceptable alternatives to vertebrates in early-stage discovery screens. Because of similarities between the innate immune system of insects and mammals, insects can replace mammals in some types of studies. Drosophila melanogaster and the Galleria mellonella waxworm have been particularly important for analysis of virulent traits of mammalian pathogens. Waxworms and other insects have also proven valuable for the identification of pharmaceutical compounds with favorable bioavailability. The decision to adopt such models generally involves accepting a lower degree of biological similarity with mammals for significant gains in experimental throughput. In the U.S., the numbers of rats and mice used is estimated to be from 11 million to between 20 and 100 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils. Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate. Mice are widely considered to be the best model of inherited human disease and share 95% of their genes with humans. With the advent of genetic engineering technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases. Rats are also widely used for physiology, toxicology and cancer research, but genetic manipulation is much harder in rats than in mice, which limits the use of these rodents in basic science. Dogs are widely used in biomedical research, testing, and education—particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, in accordance with the regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. One of the most significant advancements in medical science involves the use of dogs in developing the answers to insulin production in the body for diabetics and the role of the pancreas in this process. They found that the pancreas was responsible for producing insulin in the body and that removal of the pancreas, resulted in the development of diabetes in the dog. After re-injecting the pancreatic extract (insulin), the blood glucose levels were significantly lowered. The advancements made in this research involving the use of dogs has resulted in a definite improvement in the quality of life for both humans and animals.[citation needed] The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Welfare Report shows that 60,979 dogs were used in USDA-registered facilities in 2016. In the UK, according to the UK Home Office, there were 3,847 procedures on dogs in 2017. Of the other large EU users of dogs, Germany conducted 3,976 procedures on dogs in 2016 and France conducted 4,204 procedures in 2016. In both cases this represents under 0.2% of the total number of procedures conducted on animals in the respective countries. Zebrafish are commonly used for the basic study and development of various cancers. Used to explore the immune system and genetic strains. They are low in cost, small in size, have a fast reproduction rate, and able to observe cancer cells in real time. Humans and zebrafish share neoplasm similarities which is why they are used for research. The National Library of Medicine shows many examples of the types of cancer zebrafish are used in. The use of zebrafish have allowed them to find differences between MYC-driven pre-B vs T-ALL and be exploited to discover novel pre-B ALL therapies on acute lymphocytic leukemia. The National Library of Medicine also explains how a neoplasm is difficult to diagnose at an early stage. Understanding the molecular mechanism of digestive tract tumorigenesis and searching for new treatments is the current research. Zebrafish and humans share similar gastric cancer cells in the gastric cancer xenotransplantation model. This allowed researchers to find that Triphala could inhibit the growth and metastasis of gastric cancer cells. Since zebrafish liver cancer genes are related with humans they have become widely used in liver cancer search, as will as many other cancers. Non-human primates (NHPs) are used in toxicology tests, studies of AIDS and hepatitis, studies of neurology, behavior and cognition, reproduction, genetics, and xenotransplantation. They are caught in the wild or purpose-bred. In the United States and China, most primates are domestically purpose-bred, whereas in Europe the majority are imported purpose-bred. The European Commission reported that in 2011, 6,012 monkeys were experimented on in European laboratories. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there were 71,188 monkeys in U.S. laboratories in 2016. 23,465 monkeys were imported into the U.S. in 2014 including 929 who were caught in the wild. Most of the NHPs used in experiments are macaques; but marmosets, spider monkeys, and squirrel monkeys are also used, and baboons and chimpanzees are used in the US. As of 2015[update], there are approximately 730 chimpanzees in U.S. laboratories. In a survey in 2003, it was found that 89% of singly-housed primates exhibited self-injurious or abnormal stereotypyical behaviors including pacing, rocking, hair pulling, and biting among others. The first transgenic primate was produced in 2001, with the development of a method that could introduce new genes into a rhesus macaque. This transgenic technology is now being applied in the search for a treatment for the genetic disorder Huntington's disease. Notable studies on non-human primates have been part of the polio vaccine development, and development of Deep Brain Stimulation, and their current heaviest non-toxicological use occurs in the monkey AIDS model, SIV. In 2008, a proposal to ban all primates experiments in the EU has sparked a vigorous debate. Over 500,000 fish and 9,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2016. The main species used is the zebrafish, Danio rerio, which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Over 20,000 rabbits were used for animal testing in the UK in 2004. Albino rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests (Draize test) because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize. The numbers of rabbits used for this purpose has fallen substantially over the past two decades. In 1996, there were 3,693 procedures on rabbits for eye irritation in the UK, and in 2017 this number was just 63. Rabbits are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies. Cats are most commonly used in neurological research. In 2016, 18,898 cats were used in the United States alone, around a third of which were used in experiments which have the potential to cause ""pain and/or distress"" though only 0.1% of cat experiments involved potential pain which was not relieved by anesthetics/analgesics. In the UK, just 198 procedures were carried out on cats in 2017. The number has been around 200 for most of the last decade. The regulations that apply to animals in laboratories vary across species. In the U.S., under the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (the Guide), published by the National Academy of Sciences, any procedure can be performed on an animal if it can be successfully argued that it is scientifically justified. Researchers are required to consult with the institution's veterinarian and its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which every research facility is obliged to maintain. The IACUC must ensure that alternatives, including non-animal alternatives, have been considered, that the experiments are not unnecessarily duplicative, and that pain relief is given unless it would interfere with the study. The IACUCs regulate all vertebrates in testing at institutions receiving federal funds in the USA. Although the Animal Welfare Act does not include purpose-bred rodents and birds, these species are equally regulated under Public Health Service policies that govern the IACUCs. The Public Health Service policy oversees the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC conducts infectious disease research on nonhuman primates, rabbits, mice, and other animals, while FDA requirements cover use of animals in pharmaceutical research. Animal Welfare Act (AWA) regulations are enforced by the USDA, whereas Public Health Service regulations are enforced by OLAW and in many cases by AAALAC. According to the 2014 U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of the Inspector General (OIG) report—which looked at the oversight of animal use during a three-year period—""some Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees ...did not adequately approve, monitor, or report on experimental procedures on animals"". The OIG found that ""as a result, animals are not always receiving basic humane care and treatment and, in some cases, pain and distress are not minimized during and after experimental procedures"". According to the report, within a three-year period, nearly half of all American laboratories with regulated species were cited for AWA violations relating to improper IACUC oversight. The USDA OIG made similar findings in a 2005 report. With only a broad number of 120 inspectors, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) oversees more than 12,000 facilities involved in research, exhibition, breeding, or dealing of animals. Others have criticized the composition of IACUCs, asserting that the committees are predominantly made up of animal researchers and university representatives who may be biased against animal welfare concerns. Larry Carbone, a laboratory animal veterinarian, writes that, in his experience, IACUCs take their work very seriously regardless of the species involved, though the use of non-human primates always raises what he calls a ""red flag of special concern"". A study published in Science magazine in July 2001 confirmed the low reliability of IACUC reviews of animal experiments. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the three-year study found that animal-use committees that do not know the specifics of the university and personnel do not make the same approval decisions as those made by animal-use committees that do know the university and personnel. Specifically, blinded committees more often ask for more information rather than approving studies. Scientists in India are protesting a recent guideline issued by the University Grants Commission to ban the use of live animals in universities and laboratories. Accurate global figures for animal testing are difficult to obtain; it has been estimated that 100 million vertebrates are experimented on around the world every year, 10–11 million of them in the EU. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics reports that global annual estimates range from 50 to 100 million animals. None of the figures include invertebrates such as shrimp and fruit flies. The USDA/APHIS has published the 2016 animal research statistics. Overall, the number of animals (covered by the Animal Welfare Act) used in research in the US rose 6.9% from 767,622 (2015) to 820,812 (2016). This includes both public and private institutions. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies. In 1995, researchers at Tufts University Center for Animals and Public Policy estimated that 14–21 million animals were used in American laboratories in 1992, a reduction from a high of 50 million used in 1970. In 1986, the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment reported that estimates of the animals used in the U.S. range from 10 million to upwards of 100 million each year, and that their own best estimate was at least 17 million to 22 million. In 2016, the Department of Agriculture listed 60,979 dogs, 18,898 cats, 71,188 non-human primates, 183,237 guinea pigs, 102,633 hamsters, 139,391 rabbits, 83,059 farm animals, and 161,467 other mammals, a total of 820,812, a figure that includes all mammals except purpose-bred mice and rats. The use of dogs and cats in research in the U.S. decreased from 1973 to 2016 from 195,157 to 60,979, and from 66,165 to 18,898, respectively. In the UK, Home Office figures show that 3.79 million procedures were carried out in 2017. 2,960 procedures used non-human primates, down over 50% since 1988. A ""procedure"" refers here to an experiment that might last minutes, several months, or years. Most animals are used in only one procedure: animals are frequently euthanized after the experiment; however death is the endpoint of some procedures. The procedures conducted on animals in the UK in 2017 were categorised as: 43% (1.61 million) sub-threshold, 4% (0.14 million) non-recovery, 36% (1.35 million) mild, 15% (0.55 million) moderate, and 4% (0.14 million) severe. A 'severe' procedure would be, for instance, any test where death is the end-point or fatalities are expected, whereas a 'mild' procedure would be something like a blood test or an MRI scan. The Three Rs (3Rs) are guiding principles for more ethical use of animals in testing. These were first described by W.M.S. Russell and R.L. Burch in 1959. The 3Rs state: The 3Rs have a broader scope than simply encouraging alternatives to animal testing, but aim to improve animal welfare and scientific quality where the use of animals can not be avoided. These 3Rs are now implemented in many testing establishments worldwide and have been adopted by various pieces of legislation and regulations. Despite the widespread acceptance of the 3Rs, many countries—including Canada, Australia, Israel, South Korea, and Germany—have reported rising experimental use of animals in recent years with increased use of mice and, in some cases, fish while reporting declines in the use of cats, dogs, primates, rabbits, guinea pigs, and hamsters. Along with other countries, China has also escalated its use of GM animals, resulting in an increase in overall animal use.[excessive citations] Animals used by laboratories are largely supplied by specialist dealers. Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied from a few main stock centers. For vertebrates, sources include breeders and dealers including Fortrea and Charles River Laboratories, which supply purpose-bred and wild-caught animals; businesses that trade in wild animals such as Nafovanny; and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. Animal shelters also supply the laboratories directly. Large centers also exist to distribute strains of genetically modified animals; the International Knockout Mouse Consortium, for example, aims to provide knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome. In the U.S., Class A breeders are licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to sell animals for research purposes, while Class B dealers are licensed to buy animals from ""random sources"" such as auctions, pound seizure, and newspaper ads. Some Class B dealers have been accused of kidnapping pets and illegally trapping strays, a practice known as bunching. It was in part out of public concern over the sale of pets to research facilities that the 1966 Laboratory Animal Welfare Act was ushered in—the Senate Committee on Commerce reported in 1966 that stolen pets had been retrieved from Veterans Administration facilities, the Mayo Institute, the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, and Harvard and Yale Medical Schools. The USDA recovered at least a dozen stolen pets during a raid on a Class B dealer in Arkansas in 2003. Four states in the U.S.—Minnesota, Utah, Oklahoma, and Iowa—require their shelters to provide animals to research facilities. Fourteen states explicitly prohibit the practice, while the remainder either allow it or have no relevant legislation. In the European Union, animal sources are governed by Council Directive 86/609/EEC, which requires lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported and is not a wild animal or a stray. The latter requirement may also be exempted by special arrangement. In 2010 the Directive was revised with EU Directive 2010/63/EU. In the UK, most animals used in experiments are bred for the purpose under the 1988 Animal Protection Act, but wild-caught primates may be used if exceptional and specific justification can be established. The United States also allows the use of wild-caught primates; between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the U.S. Most of the primates",Wiki
Animalia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animalia,"Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia (/ˌænɪˈmeɪliə/). With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Animals form a clade, meaning that they arose from a single common ancestor. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described, of which around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates. It has been estimated there are as many as 7.77 million animal species on Earth. Animal body lengths range from 8.5 μm (0.00033 in) to 33.6 m (110 ft). They have complex ecologies and interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology, and the study of animal behaviour is known as ethology. The animal kingdom is divided into five infrakingdoms/superphyla, namely Porifera, Ctenophora, Placozoa, Cnidaria and Bilateria. Most living animal species belong to the infrakingdom Bilateria, a highly proliferative clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric and significantly cephalised body plan, and the vast majority of bilaterians belong to two large superphyla: the protostomes, which includes organisms such as arthropods, molluscs, flatworms, annelids and nematodes; and the deuterostomes, which include echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates, the latter of which contains the vertebrates. The much smaller basal phylum Xenacoelomorpha have an uncertain position within Bilateria. Animals first appeared in the fossil record in the late Cryogenian period and diversified in the subsequent Ediacaran period in what is known as the Avalon explosion. Earlier evidence of animals is still controversial; the sponge-like organism Otavia has been dated back to the Tonian period at the start of the Neoproterozoic, but its identity as an animal is heavily contested. Nearly all modern animal phyla first appeared in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago (Mya), and most classes during the Ordovician radiation 485.4 Mya. Common to all living animals, 6,331 groups of genes have been identified that may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived about 650 Mya during the Cryogenian period. Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous with Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa. Humans make use of many other animal species for food (including meat, eggs, and dairy products), for materials (such as leather, fur, and wool), as pets and as working animals for transportation, and services. Dogs, the first domesticated animal, have been used in hunting, in security and in warfare, as have horses, pigeons and birds of prey; while other terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sports, trophies or profits. Non-human animals are also an important cultural element of human evolution, having appeared in cave arts and totems since the earliest times, and are frequently featured in mythology, religion, arts, literature, heraldry, politics, and sports. The word animal comes from the Latin noun animal of the same meaning, which is itself derived from Latin animalis 'having breath or soul'. The biological definition includes all members of the kingdom Animalia. In colloquial usage, the term animal is often used to refer only to nonhuman animals. The term metazoa is derived from Ancient Greek μετα meta 'after' (in biology, the prefix meta- stands for 'later') and ζῷᾰ zōia 'animals', plural of ζῷον zōion 'animal'. Animals have several characteristics that they share with other living things. Animals are eukaryotic, multicellular, and aerobic, as are plants and fungi. Unlike plants and algae, which produce their own food, animals cannot produce their own food a feature they share with fungi. Animals ingest organic material and digest it internally. Animals have structural characteristics that set them apart from all other living things: Typically, there is an internal digestive chamber with either one opening (in Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and flatworms) or two openings (in most bilaterians). Animal development is controlled by Hox genes, which signal the times and places to develop structures such as body segments and limbs. During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised into specialised tissues and organs, making the formation of complex structures possible, and allowing cells to be differentiated. The extracellular matrix may be calcified, forming structures such as shells, bones, and spicules. In contrast, the cells of other multicellular organisms (primarily algae, plants, and fungi) are held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth. Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction. They produce haploid gametes by meiosis; the smaller, motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger, non-motile gametes are ova. These fuse to form zygotes, which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere, called a blastula. In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location, attach to the seabed, and develop into a new sponge. In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement. It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers, an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm. In most cases, a third germ layer, the mesoderm, also develops between them. These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs. Repeated instances of mating with a close relative during sexual reproduction generally leads to inbreeding depression within a population due to the increased prevalence of harmful recessive traits. Animals have evolved numerous mechanisms for avoiding close inbreeding. Some animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent. This may take place through fragmentation; budding, such as in Hydra and other cnidarians; or parthenogenesis, where fertile eggs are produced without mating, such as in aphids. Animals are categorised into ecological groups depending on their trophic levels and how they consume organic material. Such groupings include carnivores (further divided into subcategories such as piscivores, insectivores, ovivores, etc.), herbivores (subcategorised into folivores, graminivores, frugivores, granivores, nectarivores, algivores, etc.), omnivores, fungivores, scavengers/detritivores, and parasites. Interactions between animals of each biome form complex food webs within that ecosystem. In carnivorous or omnivorous species, predation is a consumer–resource interaction where the predator feeds on another organism, its prey, who often evolves anti-predator adaptations to avoid being fed upon. Selective pressures imposed on one another lead to an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey, resulting in various antagonistic/competitive coevolutions. Almost all multicellular predators are animals. Some consumers use multiple methods; for example, in parasitoid wasps, the larvae feed on the hosts' living tissues, killing them in the process, but the adults primarily consume nectar from flowers. Other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours, such as hawksbill sea turtles which mainly eat sponges. Most animals rely on biomass and bioenergy produced by plants and phytoplanktons (collectively called producers) through photosynthesis. Herbivores, as primary consumers, eat the plant material directly to digest and absorb the nutrients, while carnivores and other animals on higher trophic levels indirectly acquire the nutrients by eating the herbivores or other animals that have eaten the herbivores. Animals oxidise carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and other biomolecules, which allows the animal to grow and to sustain basal metabolism and fuel other biological processes such as locomotion. Some benthic animals living close to hydrothermal vents and cold seeps on the dark sea floor consume organic matter produced through chemosynthesis (via oxidising inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide) by archaea and bacteria. Animals evolved in the sea. Lineages of arthropods colonised land around the same time as land plants, probably between 510 and 471 million years ago during the Late Cambrian or Early Ordovician. Vertebrates such as the lobe-finned fish Tiktaalik started to move on to land in the late Devonian, about 375 million years ago. Animals occupy virtually all of earth's habitats and microhabitats, with faunas adapted to salt water, hydrothermal vents, fresh water, hot springs, swamps, forests, pastures, deserts, air, and the interiors of other organisms. Animals are however not particularly heat tolerant; very few of them can survive at constant temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F) or in the most extreme cold deserts of continental Antarctica. The collective global geomorphic influence of animals on the processes shaping the Earth's surface remains largely understudied, with most studies limited to individual species and well-known exemplars. The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is the largest animal that has ever lived, weighing up to 190 tonnes and measuring up to 33.6 metres (110 ft) long. The largest extant terrestrial animal is the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), weighing up to 12.25 tonnes and measuring up to 10.67 metres (35.0 ft) long. The largest terrestrial animals that ever lived were titanosaur sauropod dinosaurs such as Argentinosaurus, which may have weighed as much as 73 tonnes, and Supersaurus which may have reached 39 metres. Several animals are microscopic; some Myxozoa (obligate parasites within the Cnidaria) never grow larger than 20 μm, and one of the smallest species (Myxobolus shekel) is no more than 8.5 μm when fully grown. The following table lists estimated numbers of described extant species for the major animal phyla, along with their principal habitats (terrestrial, fresh water, and marine), and free-living or parasitic ways of life. Species estimates shown here are based on numbers described scientifically; much larger estimates have been calculated based on various means of prediction, and these can vary wildly. For instance, around 25,000–27,000 species of nematodes have been described, while published estimates of the total number of nematode species include 10,000–20,000; 500,000; 10 million; and 100 million. Using patterns within the taxonomic hierarchy, the total number of animal species—including those not yet described—was calculated to be about 7.77 million in 2011.[a] 3,000–6,500 4,000–25,000 Evidence of animals is found as long ago as the Cryogenian period. 24-Isopropylcholestane (24-ipc) has been found in rocks from roughly 650 million years ago; it is only produced by sponges and pelagophyte algae. Its likely origin is from sponges based on molecular clock estimates for the origin of 24-ipc production in both groups. Analyses of pelagophyte algae consistently recover a Phanerozoic origin, while analyses of sponges recover a Neoproterozoic origin, consistent with the appearance of 24-ipc in the fossil record. The first body fossils of animals appear in the Ediacaran, represented by forms such as Charnia and Spriggina. It had long been doubted whether these fossils truly represented animals, but the discovery of the animal lipid cholesterol in fossils of Dickinsonia establishes their nature. Animals are thought to have originated under low-oxygen conditions, suggesting that they were capable of living entirely by anaerobic respiration, but as they became specialised for aerobic metabolism they became fully dependent on oxygen in their environments. Many animal phyla first appear in the fossil record during the Cambrian explosion, starting about 539 million years ago, in beds such as the Burgess shale. Extant phyla in these rocks include molluscs, brachiopods, onychophorans, tardigrades, arthropods, echinoderms and hemichordates, along with numerous now-extinct forms such as the predatory Anomalocaris. The apparent suddenness of the event may however be an artefact of the fossil record, rather than showing that all these animals appeared simultaneously. That view is supported by the discovery of Auroralumina attenboroughii, the earliest known Ediacaran crown-group cnidarian (557–562 mya, some 20 million years before the Cambrian explosion) from Charnwood Forest, England. It is thought to be one of the earliest predators, catching small prey with its nematocysts as modern cnidarians do. Some palaeontologists have suggested that animals appeared much earlier than the Cambrian explosion, possibly as early as 1 billion years ago. Early fossils that might represent animals appear for example in the 665-million-year-old rocks of the Trezona Formation of South Australia. These fossils are interpreted as most probably being early sponges. Trace fossils such as tracks and burrows found in the Tonian period (from 1 gya) may indicate the presence of triploblastic worm-like animals, roughly as large (about 5 mm wide) and complex as earthworms. However, similar tracks are produced by the giant single-celled protist Gromia sphaerica, so the Tonian trace fossils may not indicate early animal evolution. Around the same time, the layered mats of microorganisms called stromatolites decreased in diversity, perhaps due to grazing by newly evolved animals. Objects such as sediment-filled tubes that resemble trace fossils of the burrows of wormlike animals have been found in 1.2 gya rocks in North America, in 1.5 gya rocks in Australia and North America, and in 1.7 gya rocks in Australia. Their interpretation as having an animal origin is disputed, as they might be water-escape or other structures. Animals are monophyletic, meaning they are derived from a common ancestor. Animals are the sister group to the choanoflagellates, with which they form the Choanozoa. Ros-Rocher and colleagues (2021) trace the origins of animals to unicellular ancestors, providing the external phylogeny shown in the cladogram. Uncertainty of relationships is indicated with dashed lines. The animal clade had certainly originated by 650 mya, and may have come into being as much as 800 mya, based on molecular clock evidence for different phyla. Holomycota (inc. fungi) Ichthyosporea Pluriformea Filasterea The relationships at the base of the animal tree have been debated. Other than Ctenophora, the Bilateria and Cnidaria are the only groups with symmetry, and other evidence shows they are closely related. In addition to sponges, Placozoa has no symmetry and was often considered a ""missing link"" between protists and multicellular animals. The presence of hox genes in Placozoa shows that they were once more complex. The Porifera (sponges) have long been assumed to be sister to the rest of the animals, but there is evidence that the Ctenophora may be in that position. Molecular phylogenetics has supported both the sponge-sister and ctenophore-sister hypotheses. In 2017, Roberto Feuda and colleagues, using amino acid differences, presented both, with the following cladogram for the sponge-sister view that they supported (their ctenophore-sister tree simply interchanging the places of ctenophores and sponges): Porifera Ctenophora Placozoa Cnidaria Bilateria Conversely, a 2023 study by Darrin Schultz and colleagues uses ancient gene linkages to construct the following ctenophore-sister phylogeny: Ctenophora Porifera Placozoa Cnidaria Bilateria Sponges are physically very distinct from other animals, and were long thought to have diverged first, representing the oldest animal phylum and forming a sister clade to all other animals. Despite their morphological dissimilarity with all other animals, genetic evidence suggests sponges may be more closely related to other animals than the comb jellies are. Sponges lack the complex organisation found in most other animal phyla; their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organised into distinct tissues, unlike all other animals. They typically feed by drawing in water through pores, filtering out small particles of food. The Ctenophora and Cnidaria are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening, which serves as both mouth and anus. Animals in both phyla have distinct tissues, but these are not organised into discrete organs. They are diploblastic, having only two main germ layers, ectoderm and endoderm. The tiny placozoans have no permanent digestive chamber and no symmetry; they superficially resemble amoebae. Their phylogeny is poorly defined, and under active research. The remaining animals, the great majority—comprising some 29 phyla and over a million species—form the Bilateria clade, which have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria are triploblastic, with three well-developed germ layers, and their tissues form distinct organs. The digestive chamber has two openings, a mouth and an anus, and in the Nephrozoa there is an internal body cavity, a coelom or pseudocoelom. These animals have a head end (anterior) and a tail end (posterior), a back (dorsal) surface and a belly (ventral) surface, and a left and a right side. A modern consensus phylogenetic tree for the Bilateria is shown below. Xenacoelomorpha Ambulacraria Chordata Ecdysozoa Spiralia Having a front end means that this part of the body encounters stimuli, such as food, favouring cephalisation, the development of a head with sense organs and a mouth. Many bilaterians have a combination of circular muscles that constrict the body, making it longer, and an opposing set of longitudinal muscles, that shorten the body; these enable soft-bodied animals with a hydrostatic skeleton to move by peristalsis. They also have a gut that extends through the basically cylindrical body from mouth to anus. Many bilaterian phyla have primary larvae which swim with cilia and have an apical organ containing sensory cells. However, over evolutionary time, descendant spaces have evolved which have lost one or more of each of these characteristics. For example, adult echinoderms are radially symmetric (unlike their larvae), while some parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures. Genetic studies have considerably changed zoologists' understanding of the relationships within the Bilateria. Most appear to belong to two major lineages, the protostomes and the deuterostomes. It is often suggested that the basalmost bilaterians are the Xenacoelomorpha, with all other bilaterians belonging to the subclade Nephrozoa. However, this suggestion has been contested, with other studies finding that xenacoelomorphs are more closely related to Ambulacraria than to other bilaterians. Protostomes and deuterostomes differ in several ways. Early in development, deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while many protostomes (the Spiralia) undergo spiral cleavage. Animals from both groups possess a complete digestive tract, but in protostomes the first opening of the embryonic gut develops into the mouth, and the anus forms secondarily. In deuterostomes, the anus forms first while the mouth develops secondarily. Most protostomes have schizocoelous development, where cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm. In deuterostomes, the mesoderm forms by enterocoelic pouching, through invagination of the endoderm. The main deuterostome phyla are the Ambulacraria and the Chordata. Ambulacraria are exclusively marine and include acorn worms, starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers. The chordates are dominated by the vertebrates (animals with backbones), which consist of fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The protostomes include the Ecdysozoa, named after their shared trait of ecdysis, growth by moulting, Among the largest ecdysozoan phyla are the arthropods and the nematodes. The rest of the protostomes are in the Spiralia, named for their pattern of developing by spiral cleavage in the early embryo. Major spiralian phyla include the annelids and molluscs. In the classical era, Aristotle divided animals,[d] based on his own observations, into those with blood (roughly, the vertebrates) and those without. The animals were then arranged on a scale from man (with blood, two legs, rational soul) down through the live-bearing tetrapods (with blood, four legs, sensitive soul) and other groups such as crustaceans (no blood, many legs, sensitive soul) down to spontaneously generating creatures like sponges (no blood, no legs, vegetable soul). Aristotle was uncertain whether sponges were animals, which in his system ought to have sensation, appetite, and locomotion, or plants, which did not: he knew that sponges could sense touch and would contract if about to be pulled off their rocks, but that they were rooted like plants and never moved about. In 1758, Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical classification in his Systema Naturae. In his original scheme, the animals were one of three kingdoms, divided into the classes of Vermes, Insecta, Pisces, Amphibia, Aves, and Mammalia. Since then, the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum, the Chordata, while his Insecta (which included the crustaceans and arachnids) and Vermes have been renamed or broken up. The process was begun in 1793 by Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck, who called the Vermes une espèce de chaos ('a chaotic mess')[e] and split the group into three new phyla: worms, echinoderms, and polyps (which contained corals and jellyfish). By 1809, in his Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck had created nine phyla apart from vertebrates (where he still had four phyla: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish) and molluscs, namely cirripedes, annelids, crustaceans, arachnids, insects, worms, radiates, polyps, and infusorians. In his 1817 Le Règne Animal, Georges Cuvier used comparative anatomy to group the animals into four embranchements ('branches' with different body plans, roughly corresponding to phyla), namely vertebrates, molluscs, articulated animals (arthropods and annelids), and zoophytes (radiata) (echinoderms, cnidaria and other forms). This division into four was followed by the embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer in 1828, the zoologist Louis Agassiz in 1857, and the comparative anatomist Richard Owen in 1860. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into two subkingdoms: Metazoa (multicellular animals, with five phyla: coelenterates, echinoderms, articulates, molluscs, and vertebrates) and Protozoa (single-celled animals), including a sixth animal phylum, sponges. The protozoa were later moved to the former kingdom Protista, leaving only the Metazoa as a synonym of Animalia. The human population exploits a large number of other animal species for food, both of domesticated livestock species in animal husbandry and, mainly at sea, by hunting wild species. Marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food. A smaller number of species are farmed commercially. Humans and their livestock make up more than 90% of the biomass of all terrestrial vertebrates, and almost as much as all insects combined. Invertebrates including cephalopods, crustaceans, insects—principally bees and silkworms—and bivalve or gastropod molluscs are hunted or farmed for food, fibres. Chickens, cattle, sheep, pigs, and other animals are raised as livestock for meat across the world. Animal fibres such as wool and silk are used to make textiles, while animal sinews have been used as lashings and bindings, and leather is widely used to make shoes and other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur to make items such as coats and hats. Dyestuffs including carmine (cochineal), shellac, and kermes have been made from the bodies of insects. Working animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the first days of agriculture. Animals such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster serve a major role in science as experimental models. Animals have been used to create vaccines since their discovery in the 18th century. Some medicines such as the cancer drug trabectedin are based on toxins or other molecules of animal origin. People have used hunting dogs to help chase down and retrieve animals, and birds of prey to catch birds and mammals, while tethered cormorants have been used to catch fish. Poison dart frogs have been used to poison the tips of blowpipe darts. A wide variety of animals are kept as pets, from invertebrates such as tarantulas, octopuses, and praying mantises, reptiles such as snakes and chameleons, and birds including canaries, parakeets, and parrots all finding a place. However, the most kept pet species are mammals, namely dogs, cats, and rabbits. There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own. A wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport. The signs of the Western and Chinese zodiacs are based on animals. In China and Japan, the butterfly has been seen as the personification of a person's soul, and in classical representation the butterfly is also the symbol of the soul. Animals have been the subjects of art from the earliest times, both historical, as in ancient Egypt, and prehistoric, as in the cave paintings at Lascaux. Major animal paintings include Albrecht Dürer's 1515 The Rhinoceros, and George Stubbs's c. 1762 horse portrait Whistlejacket. Insects, birds and mammals play roles in literature and film, such as in giant bug movies. Animals including insects and mammals feature in mythology and religion. The scarab beetle was sacred in ancient Egypt, and the cow is sacred in Hinduism. Among other mammals, deer, horses, lions, bats, bears, and wolves are the subjects of myths and worship.",Wiki
Antimicrobial_resistance,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_resistance,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR or AR) occurs when microbes evolve mechanisms that protect them from antimicrobials, which are drugs used to treat infections. This resistance affects all classes of microbes, including bacteria (antibiotic resistance), viruses (antiviral resistance), parasites (antiparasitic resistance), and fungi (antifungal resistance). Together, these adaptations fall under the AMR umbrella, posing significant challenges to healthcare worldwide. Misuse and improper management of antimicrobials are primary drivers of this resistance, though it can also occur naturally through genetic mutations and the spread of resistant genes. Antibiotic resistance, a significant AMR subset, enables bacteria to survive antibiotic treatment, complicating infection management and treatment options. Resistance arises through spontaneous mutation, horizontal gene transfer, and increased selective pressure from antibiotic overuse, both in medicine and agriculture, which accelerates resistance development. The burden of AMR is immense, with nearly 5 million annual deaths associated with resistant infections. Infections from AMR microbes are more challenging to treat and often require costly alternative therapies that may have more severe side effects. Preventive measures, such as using narrow-spectrum antibiotics and improving hygiene practices, aim to reduce the spread of resistance. Microbes resistant to multiple drugs are termed multidrug-resistant (MDR) and are sometimes called superbugs. The World Health Organization (WHO) claims that AMR is one of the top global public health and development threats, estimating that bacterial AMR was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019 and contributed to 4.95 million deaths. Moreover, the WHO and other international bodies warn that AMR could lead to up to 10 million deaths annually by 2050 unless actions are taken. Global initiatives, such as calls for international AMR treaties, emphasize coordinated efforts to limit misuse, fund research, and provide access to necessary antimicrobials in developing nations. However, the COVID-19 pandemic redirected resources and scientific attention away from AMR, intensifying the challenge. Antimicrobial resistance means a microorganism's resistance to an antimicrobial drug that was once able to treat an infection by that microorganism. A person cannot become resistant to antibiotics. Resistance is a property of the microbe, not a person or other organism infected by a microbe. All types of microbes can develop drug resistance. Thus, there are antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral and antiparasitic resistance. Antibiotic resistance is a subset of antimicrobial resistance. This more specific resistance is linked to bacteria and thus broken down into two further subsets, microbiological and clinical. Microbiological resistance is the most common and occurs from genes, mutated or inherited, that allow the bacteria to resist the mechanism to kill the microbe associated with certain antibiotics. Clinical resistance is shown through the failure of many therapeutic techniques where the bacteria that are normally susceptible to a treatment become resistant after surviving the outcome of the treatment. In both cases of acquired resistance, the bacteria can pass the genetic catalyst for resistance through horizontal gene transfer: conjugation, transduction, or transformation. This allows the resistance to spread across the same species of pathogen or even similar bacterial pathogens. WHO report released April 2014 stated, ""this serious threat is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country. Antibiotic resistance—when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections—is now a major threat to public health."" Each year, nearly 5 million deaths are associated with AMR globally. In 2019, global deaths attributable to AMR numbered 1.27 million in 2019. That same year, AMR may have contributed to 5 million deaths and one in five people who died due to AMR were children under five years old. In 2018, WHO considered antibiotic resistance to be one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development. Deaths attributable to AMR vary by area: The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control calculated that in 2015 there were 671,689 infections in the EU and European Economic Area caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, resulting in 33,110 deaths. Most were acquired in healthcare settings. In 2019 there were 133,000 deaths caused by AMR. AMR is driven largely by the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials. Yet, at the same time, many people around the world do not have access to essential antimicrobials. This leads to microbes either evolving a defense against drugs used to treat them, or certain strains of microbes that have a natural resistance to antimicrobials becoming much more prevalent than the ones that are easily defeated with medication. While antimicrobial resistance does occur naturally over time, the use of antimicrobial agents in a variety of settings both within the healthcare industry and outside of has led to antimicrobial resistance becoming increasingly more prevalent. Although many microbes develop resistance to antibiotics over time though natural mutation, overprescribing and inappropriate prescription of antibiotics have accelerated the problem. It is possible that as many as 1 in 3 prescriptions written for antibiotics are unnecessary. Every year, approximately 154 million prescriptions for antibiotics are written. Of these, up to 46 million are unnecessary or inappropriate for the condition that the patient has. Microbes may naturally develop resistance through genetic mutations that occur during cell division, and although random mutations are rare, many microbes reproduce frequently and rapidly, increasing the chances of members of the population acquiring a mutation that increases resistance. Many individuals stop taking antibiotics when they begin to feel better. When this occurs, it is possible that the microbes that are less susceptible to treatment still remain in the body. If these microbes are able to continue to reproduce, this can lead to an infection by bacteria that are less susceptible or even resistant to an antibiotic. AMR is a naturally occurring process. Antimicrobial resistance can evolve naturally due to continued exposure to antimicrobials. Natural selection means that organisms that are able to adapt to their environment, survive, and continue to produce offspring. As a result, the types of microorganisms that are able to survive over time with continued attack by certain antimicrobial agents will naturally become more prevalent in the environment, and those without this resistance will become obsolete. Some contemporary antimicrobial resistances have also evolved naturally before the use of antimicrobials of human clinical uses. For instance, methicillin-resistance evolved as a pathogen of hedgehogs, possibly as a co-evolutionary adaptation of the pathogen to hedgehogs that are infected by a dermatophyte that naturally produces antibiotics. Also, many soil fungi and bacteria are natural competitors and the original antibiotic penicillin discovered by Alexander Fleming rapidly lost clinical effectiveness in treating humans and, furthermore, none of the other natural penicillins (F, K, N, X, O, U1 or U6) are currently in clinical use.[citation needed] Antimicrobial resistance can be acquired from other microbes through swapping genes in a process termed horizontal gene transfer. This means that once a gene for resistance to an antibiotic appears in a microbial community, it can then spread to other microbes in the community, potentially moving from a non-disease causing microbe to a disease-causing microbe. This process is heavily driven by the natural selection processes that happen during antibiotic use or misuse. Over time, most of the strains of bacteria and infections present will be the type resistant to the antimicrobial agent being used to treat them, making this agent now ineffective to defeat most microbes. With the increased use of antimicrobial agents, there is a speeding up of this natural process. In the vast majority of countries, antibiotics can only be prescribed by a doctor and supplied by a pharmacy. Self-medication by consumers is defined as ""the taking of medicines on one's own initiative or on another person's suggestion, who is not a certified medical professional"", and it has been identified as one of the primary reasons for the evolution of antimicrobial resistance. Self-medication with antibiotics is an unsuitable way of using them but a common practice in resource-constrained countries. The practice exposes individuals to the risk of bacteria that have developed antimicrobial resistance. Many people resort to this out of necessity, when access to a physician is unavailable, or when patients have a limited amount of time or money to see a doctor. This increased access makes it extremely easy to obtain antimicrobials. An example is India, where in the state of Punjab 73% of the population resorted to treating their minor health issues and chronic illnesses through self-medication. Self-medication is higher outside the hospital environment, and this is linked to higher use of antibiotics, with the majority of antibiotics being used in the community rather than hospitals. The prevalence of self-medication in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) ranges from 8.1% to 93%. Accessibility, affordability, and conditions of health facilities, as well as the health-seeking behavior, are factors that influence self-medication in low- and middle-income countries. Two significant issues with self-medication are the lack of knowledge of the public on, firstly, the dangerous effects of certain antimicrobials (for example ciprofloxacin which can cause tendonitis, tendon rupture and aortic dissection) and, secondly, broad microbial resistance and when to seek medical care if the infection is not clearing. In order to determine the public's knowledge and preconceived notions on antibiotic resistance, a screening of 3,537 articles published in Europe, Asia, and North America was done. Of the 55,225 total people surveyed in the articles, 70% had heard of antibiotic resistance previously, but 88% of those people thought it referred to some type of physical change in the human body. Clinical misuse by healthcare professionals is another contributor to increased antimicrobial resistance. Studies done in the US show that the indication for treatment of antibiotics, choice of the agent used, and the duration of therapy was incorrect in up to 50% of the cases studied. In 2010 and 2011 about a third of antibiotic prescriptions in outpatient settings in the United States were not necessary. Another study in an intensive care unit in a major hospital in France has shown that 30% to 60% of prescribed antibiotics were unnecessary. These inappropriate uses of antimicrobial agents promote the evolution of antimicrobial resistance by supporting the bacteria in developing genetic alterations that lead to resistance. According to research conducted in the US that aimed to evaluate physicians' attitudes and knowledge on antimicrobial resistance in ambulatory settings, only 63% of those surveyed reported antibiotic resistance as a problem in their local practices, while 23% reported the aggressive prescription of antibiotics as necessary to avoid failing to provide adequate care. This demonstrates how a majority of doctors underestimate the impact that their own prescribing habits have on antimicrobial resistance as a whole. It also confirms that some physicians may be overly cautious and prescribe antibiotics for both medical or legal reasons, even when clinical indications for use of these medications are not always confirmed. This can lead to unnecessary antimicrobial use, a pattern which may have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies have shown that common misconceptions about the effectiveness and necessity of antibiotics to treat common mild illnesses contribute to their overuse. Important to the conversation of antibiotic use is the veterinary medical system. Veterinary oversight is required by law for all medically important antibiotics. Veterinarians use the Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model (PK/PD) approach to ensuring that the correct dose of the drug is delivered to the correct place at the correct timing. Increased antibiotic use during the early waves of the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate this global health challenge. Moreover, pandemic burdens on some healthcare systems may contribute to antibiotic-resistant infections. On the other hand, ""increased hand hygiene, decreased international travel, and decreased elective hospital procedures may have reduced AMR pathogen selection and spread in the short term"" during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of disinfectants such as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and antiseptic hand wash may also have the potential to increase antimicrobial resistance. Extensive use of disinfectants can lead to mutations that induce antimicrobial resistance. A 2024 United Nations High-Level Meeting on AMR has pledged to reduce deaths associated with bacterial AMR by 10% over the next six years. In their first major declaration on the issue since 2016, global leaders also committed to raising $100 million to update and implement AMR action plans. However, the final draft of the declaration omitted an earlier target to reduce antibiotic use in animals by 30% by 2030, due to opposition from meat-producing countries and the farming industry. Critics argue this omission is a major weakness, as livestock accounts for around 73% of global sales of antimicrobial agents, including antibiotics, antivirals, and antiparasitics. Considering the complex interactions between humans, animals and the environment, it is also important to consider the environmental aspects and contributors to antimicrobial resistance. Although there are still some knowledge gaps in understanding the mechanisms and transmission pathways, environmental pollution is considered a significant contributor to antimicrobial resistance. Important contributing factors are through ""antibiotic residues"", ""industrial effluents"", "" agricultural runoffs"", ""heavy metals"", ""biocides and pesticides"" and ""sewage and wastewater"" that create reservoirs for resistant genes and bacteria that facilitates the transfer of human pathogens. Unused or expired antibiotics, if not disposed of properly, can enter water systems and soil. Discharge from pharmaceutical manufacturing and other industrial companies can also introduce antibiotics and other chemicals into the environment. These factors allow for creating selective pressure for resistant bacteria. Antibiotics used in livestock and aquaculture can contaminate soil and water, which promotes resistance in environmental microbes. Heavy metals such as zinc, copper and mercury, and also biocides and pesticides, can co- select for antibiotic resistance, enhancing their speed. Inadequate treatment of sewage and wastewater allows resistant bacteria and genes to spread through water systems. The antimicrobial resistance crisis also extends to the food industry, specifically with food producing animals. With an ever-increasing human population, there is constant pressure to intensify productivity in many agricultural sectors, including the production of meat as a source of protein. Antibiotics are fed to livestock to act as growth supplements, and a preventive measure to decrease the likelihood of infections. Farmers typically use antibiotics in animal feed to improve growth rates and prevent infections. However, this is illogical as antibiotics are used to treat infections and not prevent infections. 80% of antibiotic use in the U.S. is for agricultural purposes and about 70% of these are medically important. Overusing antibiotics gives the bacteria time to adapt leaving higher doses or even stronger antibiotics needed to combat the infection. Though antibiotics for growth promotion were banned throughout the EU in 2006, 40 countries worldwide still use antibiotics to promote growth. This can result in the transfer of resistant bacterial strains into the food that humans eat, causing potentially fatal transfer of disease. While the practice of using antibiotics as growth promoters does result in better yields and meat products, it is a major issue and needs to be decreased in order to prevent antimicrobial resistance. Though the evidence linking antimicrobial usage in livestock to antimicrobial resistance is limited, the World Health Organization Advisory Group on Integrated Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance strongly recommended the reduction of use of medically important antimicrobials in livestock. Additionally, the Advisory Group stated that such antimicrobials should be expressly prohibited for both growth promotion and disease prevention in food producing animals. By mapping antimicrobial consumption in livestock globally, it was predicted that in 228 countries there would be a total 67% increase in consumption of antibiotics by livestock by 2030. In some countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa it is predicted that a 99% increase will occur. Several countries have restricted the use of antibiotics in livestock, including Canada, China, Japan, and the US. These restrictions are sometimes associated with a reduction of the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in humans. In the United States the Veterinary Feed Directive went into practice in 2017 dictating that All medically important antibiotics to be used in feed or water for food animal species require a veterinary feed directive (VFD) or a prescription. Most pesticides protect crops against insects and plants, but in some cases antimicrobial pesticides are used to protect against various microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, algae, and protozoa. The overuse of many pesticides in an effort to have a higher yield of crops has resulted in many of these microbes evolving a tolerance against these antimicrobial agents. Currently there are over 4000 antimicrobial pesticides registered with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and sold to market, showing the widespread use of these agents. It is estimated that for every single meal a person consumes, 0.3 g of pesticides is used, as 90% of all pesticide use is in agriculture. A majority of these products are used to help defend against the spread of infectious diseases, and hopefully protect public health. But out of the large amount of pesticides used, it is also estimated that less than 0.1% of those antimicrobial agents, actually reach their targets. That leaves over 99% of all pesticides used available to contaminate other resources. In soil, air, and water these antimicrobial agents are able to spread, coming in contact with more microorganisms and leading to these microbes evolving mechanisms to tolerate and further resist pesticides. The use of antifungal azole pesticides that drive environmental azole resistance have been linked to azole resistance cases in the clinical setting. The same issues confront the novel antifungal classes (e.g. orotomides) which are again being used in both the clinic and agriculture. Wildlife, including wild and migratory birds, serve as a reservoir for zoonotic disease and antimicrobial-resistant organisms. Birds are a key link between the transmission of zoonotic diseases to human populations. By the same token, increased contact between wild birds and human populations (including domesticated animals), has increased the amount of anti-microbial resistance (AMR) to the bird population. The introduction of AMR to wild birds positively correlates with human pollution and increased human contact. Additionally, wild birds can participate in horizontal gene transfer with bacteria, leading to the transmission of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARG). For simplicity, wild bird populations can be divided into two major categories, wild sedentary birds and wild migrating birds. Wild sedentary bird exposure to AMR is through increased contact with densely populated areas, human waste, domestic animals, and domestic animal/livestock waste. Wild migrating birds interact with sedentary birds in different environments along their migration route. This increases the rate and diversity of AMR across varying ecosystems. Neglect of wildlife in the global discussions surrounding health security and AMR, creates large barriers to true AMR surveillance. The surveillance of anti-microbial resistant organisms in wild birds is a potential metric for the rate of AMR in the environment. This surveillance also allows for further investigation into the transmission routs between different ecosystems and human populations (including domesticated animals and livestock). Such information gathered from wild bird biomes, can help identify patterns of diseased transmission and better target interventions. These targeted interventions can inform the use of antimicrobial agents and reduce the persistence of multi-drug resistant organisms. Permafrost is a term used to refer to any ground that remained frozen for two years or more, with the oldest known examples continuously frozen for around 700,000 years. In the recent decades, permafrost has been rapidly thawing due to climate change.: 1237 The cold preserves any organic matter inside the permafrost, and it is possible for microorganisms to resume their life functions once it thaws. While some common pathogens such as influenza, smallpox or the bacteria associated with pneumonia have failed to survive intentional attempts to revive them, more cold-adapted microorganisms such as anthrax, or several ancient plant and amoeba viruses, have successfully survived prolonged thaw. Some scientists have argued that the inability of known causative agents of contagious diseases to survive being frozen and thawed makes this threat unlikely. Instead, there have been suggestions that when modern pathogenic bacteria interact with the ancient ones, they may, through horizontal gene transfer, pick up genetic sequences which are associated with antimicrobial resistance, exacerbating an already difficult issue. Antibiotics to which permafrost bacteria have displayed at least some resistance include chloramphenicol, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, spectinomycin and neomycin. However, other studies show that resistance levels in ancient bacteria to modern antibiotics remain lower than in the contemporary bacteria from the active layer of thawed ground above them, which may mean that this risk is ""no greater"" than from any other soil. There have been increasing public calls for global collective action to address the threat, including a proposal for an international treaty on antimicrobial resistance. Further detail and attention is still needed in order to recognize and measure trends in resistance on the international level; the idea of a global tracking system has been suggested but implementation has yet to occur. A system of this nature would provide insight to areas of high resistance as well as information necessary for evaluating programs, introducing interventions and other changes made to fight or reverse antibiotic resistance. Delaying or minimizing the use of antibiotics for certain conditions may help safely reduce their use. Antimicrobial treatment duration should be based on the infection and other health problems a person may have. For many infections once a person has improved there is little evidence that stopping treatment causes more resistance. Some, therefore, feel that stopping early may be reasonable in some cases. Other infections, however, do require long courses regardless of whether a person feels better. Delaying antibiotics for ailments such as a sore throat and otitis media may have no difference in the rate of complications compared with immediate antibiotics, for example. When treating respiratory tract infections, clinical judgement is required as to the appropriate treatment (delayed or immediate antibiotic use). The study, ""Shorter and Longer Antibiotic Durations for Respiratory Infections: To Fight Antimicrobial Resistance—A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study in a Secondary Care Setting in the UK,"" highlights the urgency of reevaluating antibiotic treatment durations amidst the global challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). It investigates the effectiveness of shorter versus longer antibiotic regimens for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in a UK secondary care setting, emphasizing the need for evidence-based prescribing practices to optimize patient outcomes and combat AMR. There are multiple national and international monitoring programs for drug-resistant threats, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacterales, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB). ResistanceOpen is an online global map of antimicrobial resistance developed by HealthMap which displays aggregated data on antimicrobial resistance from publicly available and user submitted data. The website can display data for a 25 miles (40 km) radius from a location. Users may submit data from antibiograms for individual hospitals or laboratories. European data is from the EARS-Net (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network), part of the ECDC. ResistanceMap is a website by the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy and provides data on antimicrobial resistance on a global level. The WHO's AMR global action plan also recommends antimicrobial resistance surveillance in animals. Initial steps in the EU for establishing the veterinary counterpart EARS-Vet (EARS-Net for veterinary medicine) have been made. AMR data from pets in particular is scarce, but needed to support antibiotic stewardship in veterinary medicine. By comparison there is a lack of national and international monitoring programs for antifungal resistance. Antimicrobial stewardship programmes appear useful in reducing rates of antimicrobial resistance. The antimicrobial stewardship program will also provide pharmacists with the knowledge to educate patients that antibiotics will not work for a virus for example. Excessive antimicrobial use has become one of the top contributors to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance. Since the beginning of the antimicrobial era, antimicrobials have been used to treat a wide range of infectious diseases. Overuse of antimicrobials has become the primary cause of rising levels of antimicrobial resistance. The main problem is that doctors are willing to prescribe antimicrobials to ill-informed individuals who believe that antimicrobials can cure nearly all illnesses, including viral infections like the common cold. In an analysis of drug prescriptions, 36% of individuals with a cold or an upper respiratory infection (both usually viral in origin) were given prescriptions for antibiotics. These prescriptions accomplished nothing other than increasing the risk of further evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Using antimicrobials without prescription is another driving force leading to the overuse of antibiotics to self-treat diseases like the common cold, cough, fever, and dysentery resulting in an epidemic of antibiotic resistance in countries like Bangladesh, risking its spread around the globe. Introducing strict antibiotic stewardship in the outpatient setting to reduce inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics may reduce the emerging bacterial resistance. The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) guidance and antibiotic book has been introduced to guide antibiotic choice for the 30 most common infections in adults and children to reduce inappropriate prescribing in primary care and hospitals. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics are preferred due to their lower resistance potential, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are only recommended for people with more severe symptoms. Some antibiotics are more likely to confer resistance, so are kept as reserve antibiotics in the AWaRe book. Various diagnostic strategies have been employed to prevent the overuse of antifungal therapy in the clinic, proving a safe alternative to empirical antifungal therapy, and thus underpinning antifungal stewardship schemes. Antimicrobial stewardship teams in hospitals are encouraging optimal use of antimicrobials. The goals of antimicrobial stewardship are to help practitioners pick the right drug at the right dose and duration of therapy while preventing misuse and minimizing the development of resistance. Stewardship interventions may reduce the length of stay by an average of slightly over 1 day while not increasing the risk of death. Dispensing, to discharged in-house patients, the exact number of antibiotic pharmaceutical units necessary to complete an ongoing treatment can reduce antibiotic leftovers within the community as community pharmacies can have antibiotic package inefficiencies. Given the volume of care provided in primary care (general practice), recent strategies have focused on reducing unnecessary antimicrobial prescribing in this setting. Simple interventions, such as written information explaining when taking antibiotics is not necessary, for example in common infections of the upper respiratory tract, have been shown to reduce antibiotic prescribing. Various tools are also available to help professionals decide if prescribing antimicrobials is necessary. Parental expectations, driven by the worry for their children's health, can influence how often children are prescribed antibiotics. Parents often rely on their clinician for advice and reassurance. However a lack of plain language information and not having adequate time for consultation negatively impacts this relationship. In effect parents often rely on past experiences in their expectations rather than reassurance from the clinician. Adequate time for consultation and plain language information can help parents make informed decisions and avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. Parents play a critical role in reducing unnecessary antibiotic use, particularly during cold and flu season when children frequently experience respiratory illnesses. Many of these illnesses are caused by viruses, such as colds or the flu, which antibiotics cannot treat. Misusing antibiotics in these situations not only fails to benefit the child but also contributes to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, posing a broader public health threat. To address parental concerns and reduce inappropriate prescribing, healthcare providers can offer plain-language explanations about the difference between bacterial and viral infections, alongside clear guidance on managing viral illnesses without antibiotics. Vaccinations also play a vital role in reducing the incidence of serious bacterial infections that may require antibiotic treatment, thereby helping to preserve the effectiveness of existing antibiotics. Schools further amplify the spread of infections due to close contact and shared surfaces, underscoring the importance of hygiene practices like regular handwashing, covering coughs, and staying home when unwell. These preventive measures not only reduce the need for antibiotics but also lower the overall risk of resistant bacteria spreading within communities. The prescriber should closely adhere to the five rights of drug administration: the right patient, the right drug, the right dose, the right route, and the right time. Microbiological samples should be taken for culture and sensitivity testing before treatment when indicated and treatment potentially changed based on the susceptibility report.[10",Wiki
Apoptosis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis,"Apoptosis (from Ancient Greek: ἀπόπτωσις, romanized: apóptōsis, lit. 'falling off') is a form of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms and in some eukaryotic, single-celled microorganisms such as yeast. Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes include blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and mRNA decay. The average adult human loses 50 to 70 billion cells each day due to apoptosis.[a] For the average human child between 8 and 14 years old, each day the approximate loss is 20 to 30 billion cells. In contrast to necrosis, which is a form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury, apoptosis is a highly regulated and controlled process that confers advantages during an organism's life cycle. For example, the separation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the digits undergo apoptosis. Unlike necrosis, apoptosis produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies that phagocytes are able to engulf and remove before the contents of the cell can spill out onto surrounding cells and cause damage to them. Because apoptosis cannot stop once it has begun, it is a highly regulated process. Apoptosis can be initiated through one of two pathways. In the intrinsic pathway the cell kills itself because it senses cell stress, while in the extrinsic pathway the cell kills itself because of signals from other cells. Weak external signals may also activate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Both pathways induce cell death by activating caspases, which are proteases, or enzymes that degrade proteins. The two pathways both activate initiator caspases, which then activate executioner caspases, which then kill the cell by degrading proteins indiscriminately. In addition to its importance as a biological phenomenon, defective apoptotic processes have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases. Excessive apoptosis causes atrophy, whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation, such as cancer. Some factors like Fas receptors and caspases promote apoptosis, while some members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins inhibit apoptosis. German scientist Carl Vogt was first to describe the principle of apoptosis in 1842. In 1885, anatomist Walther Flemming delivered a more precise description of the process of programmed cell death. However, it was not until 1965 that the topic was resurrected. While studying tissues using electron microscopy, John Kerr at the University of Queensland was able to distinguish apoptosis from traumatic cell death. Following the publication of a paper describing the phenomenon, Kerr was invited to join Alastair Currie, as well as Andrew Wyllie, who was Currie's graduate student, at the University of Aberdeen. In 1972, the trio published a seminal article in the British Journal of Cancer. Kerr had initially used the term programmed cell necrosis, but in the article, the process of natural cell death was called apoptosis. Kerr, Wyllie and Currie credited James Cormack, a professor of Greek language at University of Aberdeen, with suggesting the term apoptosis. Kerr received the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize on March 14, 2000, for his description of apoptosis. He shared the prize with Boston biologist H. Robert Horvitz. For many years, neither ""apoptosis"" nor ""programmed cell death"" was a highly cited term. Two discoveries brought cell death from obscurity to a major field of research: identification of the first component of the cell death control and effector mechanisms, and linkage of abnormalities in cell death to human disease, in particular cancer. This occurred in 1988 when it was shown that BCL2, the gene responsible for follicular lymphoma, encoded a protein that inhibited cell death. The 2002 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Sydney Brenner, H. Robert Horvitz and John Sulston for their work identifying genes that control apoptosis. The genes were identified by studies in the nematode C. elegans and homologues of these genes function in humans to regulate apoptosis. In Greek, apoptosis translates to the ""falling off"" of leaves from a tree. Cormack, professor of Greek language, reintroduced the term for medical use as it had a medical meaning for the Greeks over two thousand years before. Hippocrates used the term to mean ""the falling off of the bones"". Galen extended its meaning to ""the dropping of the scabs"". Cormack was no doubt aware of this usage when he suggested the name. Debate continues over the correct pronunciation, with opinion divided between a pronunciation with the second p silent (/æpəˈtoʊsɪs/ ap-ə-TOH-sis) and the second p pronounced (/eɪpəpˈtoʊsɪs/). In English, the p of the Greek -pt- consonant cluster is typically silent at the beginning of a word (e.g. pterodactyl, Ptolemy), but articulated when used in combining forms preceded by a vowel, as in helicopter or the orders of insects: diptera, lepidoptera, etc. In the original Kerr, Wyllie & Currie paper, there is a footnote regarding the pronunciation: We are most grateful to Professor James Cormack of the Department of Greek, University of Aberdeen, for suggesting this term. The word ""apoptosis"" (ἀπόπτωσις) is used in Greek to describe the ""dropping off"" or ""falling off"" of petals from flowers, or leaves from trees. To show the derivation clearly, we propose that the stress should be on the penultimate syllable, the second half of the word being pronounced like ""ptosis"" (with the ""p"" silent), which comes from the same root ""to fall"", and is already used to describe the drooping of the upper eyelid. The initiation of apoptosis is tightly regulated by activation mechanisms, because once apoptosis has begun, it inevitably leads to the death of the cell. The two best-understood activation mechanisms are the intrinsic pathway (also called the mitochondrial pathway) and the extrinsic pathway. The intrinsic pathway is activated by intracellular signals generated when cells are stressed and depends on the release of proteins from the intermembrane space of mitochondria. The extrinsic pathway is activated by extracellular ligands binding to cell-surface death receptors, which leads to the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). A cell initiates intracellular apoptotic signaling in response to a stress, which may bring about cell death. The binding of nuclear receptors by glucocorticoids, heat, radiation, nutrient deprivation, viral infection, hypoxia, increased intracellular concentration of free fatty acids and increased intracellular calcium concentration, for example, by damage to the membrane, can all trigger the release of intracellular apoptotic signals by a damaged cell. A number of cellular components, such as poly ADP ribose polymerase, may also help regulate apoptosis. Single cell fluctuations have been observed in experimental studies of stress induced apoptosis. Before the actual process of cell death is precipitated by enzymes, apoptotic signals must cause regulatory proteins to initiate the apoptosis pathway. This step allows those signals to cause cell death, or the process to be stopped, should the cell no longer need to die. Several proteins are involved, but two main methods of regulation have been identified: the targeting of mitochondria functionality, or directly transducing the signal via adaptor proteins to the apoptotic mechanisms. An extrinsic pathway for initiation identified in several toxin studies is an increase in calcium concentration within a cell caused by drug activity, which also can cause apoptosis via a calcium binding protease calpain. The intrinsic pathway is also known as the mitochondrial pathway. Mitochondria are essential to multicellular life. Without them, a cell ceases to respire aerobically and quickly dies. This fact forms the basis for some apoptotic pathways. Apoptotic proteins that target mitochondria affect them in different ways. They may cause mitochondrial swelling through the formation of membrane pores, or they may increase the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and cause apoptotic effectors to leak out. There is also a growing body of evidence indicating that nitric oxide is able to induce apoptosis by helping to dissipate the membrane potential of mitochondria and therefore make it more permeable. Nitric oxide has been implicated in initiating and inhibiting apoptosis through its possible action as a signal molecule of subsequent pathways that activate apoptosis. During apoptosis, cytochrome c is released from mitochondria through the actions of the proteins Bax and Bak. The mechanism of this release is enigmatic, but appears to stem from a multitude of Bax/Bak homo- and hetero-dimers of Bax/Bak inserted into the outer membrane. Once cytochrome c is released it binds with Apoptotic protease activating factor – 1 (Apaf-1) and ATP, which then bind to pro-caspase-9 to create a protein complex known as an apoptosome. The apoptosome cleaves the pro-caspase to its active form of caspase-9, which in turn cleaves and activates pro-caspase into the effector caspase-3. Mitochondria also release proteins known as SMACs (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) into the cell's cytosol following the increase in permeability of the mitochondria membranes. SMAC binds to proteins that inhibit apoptosis (IAPs) thereby deactivating them, and preventing the IAPs from arresting the process and therefore allowing apoptosis to proceed. IAP also normally suppresses the activity of a group of cysteine proteases called caspases, which carry out the degradation of the cell. Therefore, the actual degradation enzymes can be seen to be indirectly regulated by mitochondrial permeability.[citation needed] Two theories of the direct initiation of apoptotic mechanisms in mammals have been suggested: the TNF-induced (tumor necrosis factor) model and the Fas-Fas ligand-mediated model, both involving receptors of the TNF receptor (TNFR) family coupled to extrinsic signals. TNF-alpha is a cytokine produced mainly by activated macrophages, and is the major extrinsic mediator of apoptosis. Most cells in the human body have two receptors for TNF-alpha: TNFR1 and TNFR2. The binding of TNF-alpha to TNFR1 has been shown to initiate the pathway that leads to caspase activation via the intermediate membrane proteins TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) and Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD). cIAP1/2 can inhibit TNF-α signaling by binding to TRAF2. FLIP inhibits the activation of caspase-8. Binding of this receptor can also indirectly lead to the activation of transcription factors involved in cell survival and inflammatory responses. However, signalling through TNFR1 might also induce apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner.[better source needed] The link between TNF-alpha and apoptosis shows why an abnormal production of TNF-alpha plays a fundamental role in several human diseases, especially in autoimmune diseases. The TNF-alpha receptor superfamily also includes death receptors (DRs), such as DR4 and DR5. These receptors bind to the protein TRAIL and mediate apoptosis. Apoptosis is known to be one of the primary mechanisms of targeted cancer therapy. Luminescent iridium complex-peptide hybrids (IPHs) have recently been designed, which mimic TRAIL and bind to death receptors on cancer cells, thereby inducing their apoptosis. The fas receptor (First apoptosis signal) – (also known as Apo-1 or CD95) is a transmembrane protein of the TNF family which binds the Fas ligand (FasL). The interaction between Fas and FasL results in the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which contains the FADD, caspase-8 and caspase-10. In some types of cells (type I), processed caspase-8 directly activates other members of the caspase family, and triggers the execution of apoptosis of the cell. In other types of cells (type II), the Fas-DISC starts a feedback loop that spirals into increasing release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria and the amplified activation of caspase-8. Following TNF-R1 and Fas activation in mammalian cells[citation needed] a balance between proapoptotic (BAX, BID, BAK, or BAD) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-Xl and Bcl-2) members of the Bcl-2 family are established. This balance is the proportion of proapoptotic homodimers that form in the outer-membrane of the mitochondrion. The proapoptotic homodimers are required to make the mitochondrial membrane permeable for the release of caspase activators such as cytochrome c and SMAC. Control of proapoptotic proteins under normal cell conditions of nonapoptotic cells is incompletely understood, but in general, Bax or Bak are activated by the activation of BH3-only proteins, part of the Bcl-2 family. Caspases play the central role in the transduction of ER apoptotic signals. Caspases are proteins that are highly conserved, cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases. There are two types of caspases: initiator caspases (caspases 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12) and effector caspases (caspases 3, 6, and 7). The activation of initiator caspases requires binding to specific oligomeric activator protein. Effector caspases are then activated by these active initiator caspases through proteolytic cleavage. The active effector caspases then proteolytically degrade a host of intracellular proteins to carry out the cell death program.[citation needed] There also exists a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway that is mediated by AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor). The frog Xenopus laevis serves as an ideal model system for the study of the mechanisms of apoptosis. In fact, iodine and thyroxine also stimulate the spectacular apoptosis of the cells of the larval gills, tail and fins in amphibian's metamorphosis, and stimulate the evolution of their nervous system transforming the aquatic, vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial, carnivorous frog. Negative regulation of apoptosis inhibits cell death signaling pathways, helping tumors to evade cell death and developing drug resistance. The ratio between anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) and pro-apoptotic (Bax) proteins determines whether a cell lives or dies. Many families of proteins act as negative regulators categorized into either antiapoptotic factors, such as IAPs and Bcl-2 proteins or prosurvival factors like cFLIP, BNIP3, FADD, Akt, and NF-κB. Many pathways and signals lead to apoptosis, but these converge on a single mechanism that actually causes the death of the cell. After a cell receives stimulus, it undergoes organized degradation of cellular organelles by activated proteolytic caspases. In addition to the destruction of cellular organelles, mRNA is rapidly and globally degraded by a mechanism that is not yet fully characterized. mRNA decay is triggered very early in apoptosis. A cell undergoing apoptosis shows a series of characteristic morphological changes. Early alterations include: Apoptosis progresses quickly and its products are quickly removed, making it difficult to detect or visualize on classical histology sections. During karyorrhexis, endonuclease activation leaves short DNA fragments, regularly spaced in size. These give a characteristic ""laddered"" appearance on agar gel after electrophoresis. Tests for DNA laddering differentiate apoptosis from ischemic or toxic cell death. Before the apoptotic cell is disposed of, there is a process of disassembly. There are three recognized steps in apoptotic cell disassembly: The removal of dead cells by neighboring phagocytic cells has been termed efferocytosis. Dying cells that undergo the final stages of apoptosis display phagocytotic molecules, such as phosphatidylserine, on their cell surface. Phosphatidylserine is normally found on the inner leaflet surface of the plasma membrane, but is redistributed during apoptosis to the extracellular surface by a protein known as scramblase. These molecules mark the cell for phagocytosis by cells possessing the appropriate receptors, such as macrophages. The removal of dying cells by phagocytes occurs in an orderly manner without eliciting an inflammatory response. During apoptosis cellular RNA and DNA are separated from each other and sorted to different apoptotic bodies; separation of RNA is initiated as nucleolar segregation. Many knock-outs have been made in the apoptosis pathways to test the function of each of the proteins. Several caspases, in addition to APAF1 and FADD, have been mutated to determine the new phenotype. In order to create a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) knockout, an exon containing the nucleotides 3704–5364 was removed from the gene. This exon encodes a portion of the mature TNF domain, as well as the leader sequence, which is a highly conserved region necessary for proper intracellular processing. TNF-/- mice develop normally and have no gross structural or morphological abnormalities. However, upon immunization with SRBC (sheep red blood cells), these mice demonstrated a deficiency in the maturation of an antibody response; they were able to generate normal levels of IgM, but could not develop specific IgG levels. Apaf-1 is the protein that turns on caspase 9 by cleavage to begin the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis. Since a -/- mutation in the APAF-1 gene is embryonic lethal, a gene trap strategy was used in order to generate an APAF-1 -/- mouse. This assay is used to disrupt gene function by creating an intragenic gene fusion. When an APAF-1 gene trap is introduced into cells, many morphological changes occur, such as spina bifida, the persistence of interdigital webs, and open brain. In addition, after embryonic day 12.5, the brain of the embryos showed several structural changes. APAF-1 cells are protected from apoptosis stimuli such as irradiation. A BAX-1 knock-out mouse exhibits normal forebrain formation and a decreased programmed cell death in some neuronal populations and in the spinal cord, leading to an increase in motor neurons. The caspase proteins are integral parts of the apoptosis pathway, so it follows that knock-outs made have varying damaging results. A caspase 9 knock-out leads to a severe brain malformation [citation needed]. A caspase 8 knock-out leads to cardiac failure and thus embryonic lethality [citation needed]. However, with the use of cre-lox technology, a caspase 8 knock-out has been created that exhibits an increase in peripheral T cells, an impaired T cell response, and a defect in neural tube closure [citation needed]. These mice were found to be resistant to apoptosis mediated by CD95, TNFR, etc. but not resistant to apoptosis caused by UV irradiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and other stimuli. Finally, a caspase 3 knock-out was characterized by ectopic cell masses in the brain and abnormal apoptotic features such as membrane blebbing or nuclear fragmentation [citation needed]. A remarkable feature of these KO mice is that they have a very restricted phenotype: Casp3, 9, APAF-1 KO mice have deformations of neural tissue and FADD and Casp 8 KO showed defective heart development, however, in both types of KO other organs developed normally and some cell types were still sensitive to apoptotic stimuli suggesting that unknown proapoptotic pathways exist.[citation needed] Label-free live cell imaging, time-lapse microscopy, flow fluorocytometry, and transmission electron microscopy can be used to compare apoptotic and necrotic cells. There are also various biochemical techniques for analysis of cell surface markers (phosphatidylserine exposure versus cell permeability by flow cytometry), cellular markers such as DNA fragmentation (flow cytometry), caspase activation, Bid cleavage, and cytochrome c release (Western blotting). Supernatant screening for caspases, HMGB1, and cytokeratin 18 release can identify primary from secondary necrotic cells. However, no distinct surface or biochemical markers of necrotic cell death have been identified yet, and only negative markers are available. These include absence of apoptotic markers (caspase activation, cytochrome c release, and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation) and differential kinetics of cell death markers (phosphatidylserine exposure and cell membrane permeabilization). A selection of techniques that can be used to distinguish apoptosis from necroptotic cells could be found in these references. The many different types of apoptotic pathways contain a multitude of different biochemical components, many of them not yet understood. As a pathway is more or less sequential in nature, removing or modifying one component leads to an effect in another. In a living organism, this can have disastrous effects, often in the form of disease or disorder. A discussion of every disease caused by modification of the various apoptotic pathways would be impractical, but the concept overlying each one is the same: The normal functioning of the pathway has been disrupted in such a way as to impair the ability of the cell to undergo normal apoptosis. This results in a cell that lives past its ""use-by date"" and is able to replicate and pass on any faulty machinery to its progeny, increasing the likelihood of the cell's becoming cancerous or diseased.[citation needed] A recently described example of this concept in action can be seen in the development of a lung cancer called NCI-H460. The X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is overexpressed in cells of the H460 cell line. XIAPs bind to the processed form of caspase-9 and suppress the activity of apoptotic activator cytochrome c, therefore overexpression leads to a decrease in the number of proapoptotic agonists. As a consequence, the balance of anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic effectors is upset in favour of the former, and the damaged cells continue to replicate despite being directed to die. Defects in regulation of apoptosis in cancer cells occur often at the level of control of transcription factors. As a particular example, defects in molecules that control transcription factor NF-κB in cancer change the mode of transcriptional regulation and the response to apoptotic signals, to curtail dependence on the tissue that the cell belongs. This degree of independence from external survival signals, can enable cancer metastasis. The tumor-suppressor protein p53 accumulates when DNA is damaged due to a chain of biochemical factors. Part of this pathway includes alpha-interferon and beta-interferon, which induce transcription of the p53 gene, resulting in the increase of p53 protein level and enhancement of cancer cell-apoptosis. p53 prevents the cell from replicating by stopping the cell cycle at G1, or interphase, to give the cell time to repair; however, it will induce apoptosis if damage is extensive and repair efforts fail. Any disruption to the regulation of the p53 or interferon genes will result in impaired apoptosis and the possible formation of tumors. Inhibition of apoptosis can result in a number of cancers, inflammatory diseases, and viral infections. It was originally believed that the associated accumulation of cells was due to an increase in cellular proliferation, but it is now known that it is also due to a decrease in cell death. The most common of these diseases is cancer, the disease of excessive cellular proliferation, which is often characterized by an overexpression of IAP family members. As a result, the malignant cells experience an abnormal response to apoptosis induction: Cycle-regulating genes (such as p53, ras or c-myc) are mutated or inactivated in diseased cells, and further genes (such as bcl-2) also modify their expression in tumors. Some apoptotic factors are vital during mitochondrial respiration e.g. cytochrome C. Pathological inactivation of apoptosis in cancer cells is correlated with frequent respiratory metabolic shifts toward glycolysis (an observation known as the ""Warburg hypothesis"". Apoptosis in HeLa[b] cells is inhibited by proteins produced by the cell; these inhibitory proteins target retinoblastoma tumor-suppressing proteins. These tumor-suppressing proteins regulate the cell cycle, but are rendered inactive when bound to an inhibitory protein. HPV E6 and E7 are inhibitory proteins expressed by the human papillomavirus, HPV being responsible for the formation of the cervical tumor from which HeLa cells are derived. HPV E6 causes p53, which regulates the cell cycle, to become inactive. HPV E7 binds to retinoblastoma tumor suppressing proteins and limits its ability to control cell division. These two inhibitory proteins are partially responsible for HeLa cells' immortality by inhibiting apoptosis to occur. The main method of treatment for potential death from signaling-related diseases involves either increasing or decreasing the susceptibility of apoptosis in diseased cells, depending on whether the disease is caused by either the inhibition of or excess apoptosis. For instance, treatments aim to restore apoptosis to treat diseases with deficient cell death and to increase the apoptotic threshold to treat diseases involved with excessive cell death. To stimulate apoptosis, one can increase the number of death receptor ligands (such as TNF or TRAIL), antagonize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 pathway, or introduce Smac mimetics to inhibit the inhibitor (IAPs). The addition of agents such as Herceptin, Iressa, or Gleevec works to stop cells from cycling and causes apoptosis activation by blocking growth and survival signaling further upstream. Finally, adding p53-MDM2 complexes displaces p53 and activates the p53 pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Many different methods can be used either to stimulate or to inhibit apoptosis in various places along the death signaling pathway. Apoptosis is a multi-step, multi-pathway cell-death programme that is inherent in every cell of the body. In cancer, the apoptosis cell-division ratio is altered. Cancer treatment by chemotherapy and irradiation kills target cells primarily by inducing apoptosis. On the other hand, loss of control of cell death (resulting in excess apoptosis) can lead to neurodegenerative diseases, hematologic diseases, and tissue damage. Neurons that rely on mitochondrial respiration undergo apoptosis in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. (an observation known as the ""Inverse Warburg hypothesis""). Moreover, there is an inverse epidemiological comorbidity between neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. The progression of HIV is directly linked to excess, unregulated apoptosis. In a healthy individual, the number of CD4+ lymphocytes is in balance with the cells generated by the bone marrow; however, in HIV-positive patients, this balance is lost due to an inability of the bone marrow to regenerate CD4+ cells. In the case of HIV, CD4+ lymphocytes die at an accelerated rate through uncontrolled apoptosis, when stimulated. At the molecular level, hyperactive apoptosis can be caused by defects in signaling pathways that regulate the Bcl-2 family proteins. Increased expression of apoptotic proteins such as BIM, or their decreased proteolysis, leads to cell death and can cause a number of pathologies, depending on the cells where excessive activity of BIM occurs. Cancer cells can escape apoptosis through mechanisms that suppress BIM expression or by increased proteolysis of BIM.[citation needed] Treatments aiming to inhibit works to block specific caspases. Finally, the Akt protein kinase promotes cell survival through two pathways. Akt phosphorylates and inhibits Bad (a Bcl-2 family member), causing Bad to interact with the 14-3-3 scaffold, resulting in Bcl dissociation and thus cell survival. Akt also activates IKKα, which leads to NF-κB activation and cell survival. Active NF-κB induces the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis. NF-κB has been found to play both an antiapoptotic role and a proapoptotic role depending on the stimuli utilized and the cell type. The progression of the human immunodeficiency virus infection into AIDS is due primarily to the depletion of CD4+ T-helper lymphocytes in a manner that is too rapid for the body's bone marrow to replenish the cells, leading to a compromised immune system. One of the mechanisms by which T-helper cells are depleted is apoptosis, which results from a series of biochemical pathways: Cells may also die as direct consequences of viral infections. HIV-1 expression induces tubular cell G2/M arrest and apoptosis. The progression from HIV to AIDS is not immediate or even necessarily rapid; HIV's cytotoxic activity toward CD4+ lymphocytes is classified as AIDS once a given patient's CD4+ cell count falls below 200. Researchers from Kumamoto University in Japan have developed a new method to eradicate HIV in viral reservoir cells, named ""Lock-in and apoptosis."" Using the synthesized compound Heptanoylphosphatidyl L-Inositol Pentakisphophate (or L-Hippo) to bind strongly to the HIV protein PR55Gag, they were able to suppress viral budding. By suppressing viral budding, the researchers were able to trap the HIV virus in the cell and allow for the cell to undergo apoptosis (natural cell death). Associate Professor Mikako Fujita has stated that the approach is not yet available to HIV patients because the research team has to conduct further research on combining the drug therapy that currently exists with this ""Lock-in and apoptosis"" approach to lead to complete recovery from HIV. Viral induction of apoptosis occurs when one or several cells of a living organism are infected with a virus, leading to cell death. Cell death in organisms is necessary for the normal development of cells and the cell cycle maturation. It is also important in maintaining the regular functions and activities of cells. Viruses can trigger apoptosis of infected cells via a range of mechanisms including: Canine distemper virus (CDV) is known to cause apoptosis in central nervous system and lymphoid tissue of infected dogs in vivo and in vitro. Apoptosis caused by CDV is typically induced via the extrinsic pathway, which activates caspases that disrupt cellular function and eventually leads to the cells death. In normal cells, CDV activates caspase-8 first, which works as the initiator protein followed by the executioner protein caspase-3. However, apoptosis induced by CDV in HeLa cells does not involve the initiator protein caspase-8. HeLa cell apoptosis caused by CDV follows a different mechanism than that in vero cell lines. This change in the caspase cascade suggests CDV induces apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway, excluding the need for the initiator caspase-8. The executioner protein is instead activated by the internal stimuli caused by viral infection not a caspase cascade. The Oropouche virus (OROV) is found in the family Bunyaviridae. The study of apoptosis brought on by Bunyaviridae was initiated in 1996, when it was observed that apoptosis was induced by the La Crosse virus into the kidney cells of baby hamsters and into the brains of baby mice. OROV is a disease that is transmitted between humans by the biting midge (Culicoides paraensis). It is referred to as a zoonotic arbovirus and causes febrile illness, characterized by the onset of a sudden fever known as Oropouche fever. The Oropouche virus also causes disruption in cultured cells – cells that are cultivated in distinct and specific conditions. An example of this can be seen in HeLa cells, whereby the cells begin to degenerate shortly after they are infected. With the use of gel electrophoresis, it can be observed that OROV causes DNA fragmentation in HeLa cells. It can be interpreted by counting, measuring, and analyzing the cells of the Sub/G1 cell population. When HeLA cells are infected with OROV, the cytochrome C is released from the membrane of the mitochondria, into the cytosol of the cells. This type of interaction shows that apoptosis is activated via an intrinsic pathway. In order for apoptosis to occur within OROV, viral uncoating, viral internalization, along with the replication of cel",Wiki
Archaea,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea,"And see text Archaea (/ɑːrˈkiːə/ ⓘ ar-KEE-ə) is a domain of organisms. Traditionally, Archaea only included its prokaryotic members, but this has since been found to be paraphyletic, as eukaryotes are now known to have evolved from archaea. Even though the domain Archaea cladistically includes eukaryotes, the term ""archaea"" (sg.: archaeon /ɑːrˈkiːɒn/ ar-KEE-on, from the Greek ""ἀρχαῖον"", which means ancient) in English still generally refers specifically to prokaryotic members of Archaea. Archaea were initially classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (/ˌɑːrkibækˈtɪəriə/, in the Archaebacteria kingdom), but this term has fallen out of use. Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from Bacteria and Eukaryota. Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Classification is difficult because most have not been isolated in a laboratory and have been detected only by their gene sequences in environmental samples. It is unknown if they are able to produce endospores. Archaea are often similar to bacteria in size and shape, although a few have very different shapes, such as the flat, square cells of Haloquadratum walsbyi. Despite this, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably for the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes, including archaeols. Archaea use more diverse energy sources than eukaryotes, ranging from organic compounds such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. The salt-tolerant Haloarchaea use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea fix carbon (autotrophy), but unlike cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea does both. Archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding; unlike bacteria, no known species of Archaea form endospores. The first observed archaea were extremophiles, living in extreme environments such as hot springs and salt lakes with no other organisms. Improved molecular detection tools led to the discovery of archaea in almost every habitat, including soil, oceans, and marshlands. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life. They are part of the microbiota of all organisms. In the human microbiome, they are important in the gut, mouth, and on the skin. Their morphological, metabolic, and geographical diversity permits them to play multiple ecological roles: carbon fixation; nitrogen cycling; organic compound turnover; and maintaining microbial symbiotic and syntrophic communities, for example. No archaea are known to be pathogens or parasites; many are mutualists or commensals, such as the methanogens (methane-producers) that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract in humans and ruminants, where their vast numbers facilitate digestion. Methanogens are used in biogas production and sewage treatment, while biotechnology exploits enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents. For much of the 20th century, prokaryotes were regarded as a single group of organisms and classified based on their biochemistry, morphology and metabolism. Microbiologists tried to classify microorganisms based on the structures of their cell walls, their shapes, and the substances they consume. In 1965, Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling instead proposed using the sequences of the genes in different prokaryotes to work out how they are related to each other. This phylogenetic approach is the main method used today. Archaea were first classified separately from bacteria in 1977 by Carl Woese and George E. Fox, based on their ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. (At that time only the methanogens were known). They called these groups the Urkingdoms of Archaebacteria and Eubacteria, though other researchers treated them as kingdoms or subkingdoms. Woese and Fox gave the first evidence for Archaebacteria as a separate ""line of descent"": 1. lack of peptidoglycan in their cell walls, 2. two unusual coenzymes, 3. results of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. To emphasize this difference, Woese, Otto Kandler and Mark Wheelis later proposed reclassifying organisms into three then thought to be natural domains known as the three-domain system: the Eukarya, the Bacteria and the Archaea, in what is now known as the Woesian Revolution. The word archaea comes from the Ancient Greek ἀρχαῖα, meaning ""ancient things"", as the first representatives of the domain Archaea were methanogens and it was assumed that their metabolism reflected Earth's primitive atmosphere and the organisms' antiquity, but as new habitats were studied, more organisms were discovered. Extreme halophilic and hyperthermophilic microbes were also included in Archaea. For a long time, archaea were seen as extremophiles that exist only in extreme habitats such as hot springs and salt lakes, but by the end of the 20th century, archaea had been identified in non-extreme environments as well. Today, they are known to be a large and diverse group of organisms abundantly distributed throughout nature. This new appreciation of the importance and ubiquity of archaea came from using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect prokaryotes from environmental samples (such as water or soil) by multiplying their ribosomal genes. This allows the detection and identification of organisms that have not been cultured in the laboratory. The classification of archaea, and of prokaryotes in general, is a rapidly moving and contentious field. Current classification systems aim to organize archaea into groups of organisms that share structural features and common ancestors. These classifications rely heavily on the use of the sequence of ribosomal RNA genes to reveal relationships among organisms (molecular phylogenetics). Most of the culturable and well-investigated species of archaea are members of two main phyla, the ""Euryarchaeota"" and the Thermoproteota (formerly Crenarchaeota). Other groups have been tentatively created, such as the peculiar species Nanoarchaeum equitans — discovered in 2003 and assigned its own phylum, the ""Nanoarchaeota"". A new phylum ""Korarchaeota"" has also been proposed, containing a small group of unusual thermophilic species sharing features of both the main phyla, but most closely related to the Thermoproteota. Other detected species of archaea are only distantly related to any of these groups, such as the Archaeal Richmond Mine acidophilic nanoorganisms (ARMAN, comprising Micrarchaeota and Parvarchaeota), which were discovered in 2006 and are some of the smallest organisms known. A superphylum – ""TACK"" (syn. kingdom Thermoproteati)– which includes the Thaumarchaeota (now Nitrososphaerota), ""Aigarchaeota"", Crenarchaeota (now Thermoproteota), and ""Korarchaeota"" was proposed in 2011 to be related to the origin of eukaryotes. In 2017, the newly discovered and newly named ""Asgard"" (syn. kingdom Promethearchaeati) superphylum was proposed to be more closely related to the original eukaryote and a sister group to Thermoproteati/""TACK"". In 2013, the superphylum ""DPANN"" (syn. kingdom Nanobdellati) was proposed to group ""Nanoarchaeota"", ""Nanohaloarchaeota"", Archaeal Richmond Mine acidophilic nanoorganisms (ARMAN, comprising ""Micrarchaeota"" and ""Parvarchaeota""), and other similar archaea. This archaeal superphylum encompasses at least 10 different lineages and includes organisms with extremely small cell and genome sizes and limited metabolic capabilities. Therefore, Nanobdellati/""DPANN"" may include members obligately dependent on symbiotic interactions, and may even include novel parasites. However, other phylogenetic analyses found that Nanobdellati/""DPANN"" does not form a monophyletic group, and that the apparent grouping is caused by long branch attraction (LBA), suggesting that all these lineages belong to ""Euryarchaeota"". According to Tom A. Williams et al. 2017, Castelle & Banfield (2018) and GTDB release 09-RS220 (24 April 2024): ""Altarchaeales"" ""Diapherotrites"" ""Micrarchaeota"" ""Aenigmarchaeota"" ""Nanohaloarchaeota"" ""Nanoarchaeota"" ""Pavarchaeota"" ""Mamarchaeota"" ""Woesarchaeota"" ""Pacearchaeota"" Thermococci Pyrococci Methanococci Methanobacteria Methanopyri Archaeoglobi Methanocellales Methanosarcinales Methanomicrobiales Halobacteria Thermoplasmatales Methanomassiliicoccales Aciduliprofundum boonei Thermoplasma volcanium ""Korarchaeota"" Thermoproteota ""Aigarchaeota"" ""Geoarchaeota"" Nitrososphaerota ""Bathyarchaeota"" ""Odinarchaeota"" ""Thorarchaeota"" ""Lokiarchaeota"" ""Helarchaeota"" ""Heimdallarchaeota"" Eukaryota ""Undinarchaeota"" ""Huberarchaeaota"" ""Aenigmarchaeota"" ""Nanohalarchaeota"" Nanobdellota ""Altarchaeota"" ""Iainarchaeota"" ""Micrarchaeota"" ""Methanococcia"" ""Hadarchaeia"" Thermococci ""Hydrothermarchaeia"" ""Methanopyria"" ""Methanobacteriia"" ""Izemarchaea"" (MBG-D, E2) ""Poseidoniia"" (MGII & MGIII) ""Thermoplasmatia"" ""Methanomicrobia"" ""Methanoliparia"" ""Archaeoglobia"" ""Syntropharchaeia"" Methanocellia Methanosarcinia Methanonatronarchaeia Halobacteria ""Thorarchaeia"" (MBG-B) ""Njordarchaeia"" ""Sifarchaeia"" ""Wukongarchaeia"" ""Heimdallarchaeia"" (inc.

Ernst Mayr's species definition — a reproductively isolated group of interbreeding organisms — does not apply, as archaea reproduce only asexually. Archaea show high levels of horizontal gene transfer between lineages. Some researchers suggest that individuals can be grouped into species-like populations given highly similar genomes and infrequent gene transfer to/from cells with less-related genomes, as in the genus Ferroplasma. On the other hand, studies in Halorubrum found significant genetic transfer to/from less-related populations, limiting the criterion's applicability. Some researchers question whether such species designations have practical meaning. Current knowledge on genetic diversity in archaeans is fragmentary, so the total number of species cannot be estimated with any accuracy. Estimates of the number of phyla range from 18 to 23, of which only 8 have representatives that have been cultured and studied directly. Many of these hypothesized groups are known from a single rRNA sequence, so the level of diversity remains obscure. This situation is also seen in the Bacteria; many uncultured microbes present similar issues with characterization. The following phyla have been validly published according to the Prokaryotic Code; belonging to the four kingdoms of archaea: The following phyla have been proposed, but have not been validly published according to the Prokaryotic Code; phyla that do not belong to any kingdom are shown in bold: The age of the Earth is about 4.54 billion years. Scientific evidence suggests that life began on Earth at least 3.5 billion years ago. The earliest evidence for life on Earth is graphite found to be biogenic in 3.7-billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48-billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. In 2015, possible remains of biotic matter were found in 4.1-billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia. Although probable prokaryotic cell fossils date to almost 3.5 billion years ago, most prokaryotes do not have distinctive morphologies, and fossil shapes cannot be used to identify them as archaea. Instead, chemical fossils of unique lipids are more informative because such compounds do not occur in other organisms. Some publications suggest that archaeal or eukaryotic lipid remains are present in shales dating from 2.7 billion years ago, though such data have since been questioned. These lipids have also been detected in even older rocks from west Greenland. The oldest such traces come from the Isua district, which includes Earth's oldest known sediments, formed 3.8 billion years ago. The archaeal lineage may be the most ancient that exists on Earth. Woese argued that the bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes represent separate lines of descent that diverged early on from an ancestral colony of organisms. One possibility is that this occurred before the evolution of cells, when the lack of a typical cell membrane allowed unrestricted lateral gene transfer, and that the common ancestors of the three domains arose by fixation of specific subsets of genes. It is possible that the last common ancestor of bacteria and archaea was a thermophile, which raises the possibility that lower temperatures are ""extreme environments"" for archaea, and organisms that live in cooler environments appeared only later. Since archaea and bacteria are no more related to each other than they are to eukaryotes, the term prokaryote may suggest a false similarity between them. However, structural and functional similarities between lineages often occur because of shared ancestral traits or evolutionary convergence. These similarities are known as a grade, and prokaryotes are best thought of as a grade of life, characterized by such features as an absence of membrane-bound organelles. The following table compares some major characteristics of the three domains, to illustrate their similarities and differences. Archaea were split off as a third domain because of the large differences in their ribosomal RNA structure. The particular molecule 16S rRNA is key to the production of proteins in all organisms. Because this function is so central to life, organisms with mutations in their 16S rRNA are unlikely to survive, leading to great (but not absolute) stability in the structure of this polynucleotide over generations. 16S rRNA is large enough to show organism-specific variations, but still small enough to be compared quickly. In 1977, Carl Woese, a microbiologist studying the genetic sequences of organisms, developed a new comparison method that involved splitting the RNA into fragments that could be sorted and compared with other fragments from other organisms. The more similar the patterns between species, the more closely they are related. Woese used his new rRNA comparison method to categorize and contrast different organisms. He compared a variety of species and happened upon a group of methanogens with rRNA vastly different from any known prokaryotes or eukaryotes. These methanogens were much more similar to each other than to other organisms, leading Woese to propose the new domain of Archaea. His experiments showed that the archaea were genetically more similar to eukaryotes than prokaryotes, even though they were more similar to prokaryotes in structure. This led to the conclusion that Archaea and Eukarya shared a common ancestor more recent than Eukarya and Bacteria. The development of the nucleus occurred after the split between Bacteria and this common ancestor. One property unique to archaea is the abundant use of ether-linked lipids in their cell membranes. Ether linkages are more chemically stable than the ester linkages found in bacteria and eukarya, which may be a contributing factor to the ability of many archaea to survive in extreme environments that place heavy stress on cell membranes, such as extreme heat and salinity. Comparative analysis of archaeal genomes has also identified several molecular conserved signature indels and signature proteins uniquely present in either all archaea or different main groups within archaea. Another unique feature of archaea, found in no other organisms, is methanogenesis (the metabolic production of methane). Methanogenic archaea play a pivotal role in ecosystems with organisms that derive energy from oxidation of methane, many of which are bacteria, as they are often a major source of methane in such environments and can play a role as primary producers. Methanogens also play a critical role in the carbon cycle, breaking down organic carbon into methane, which is also a major greenhouse gas. This difference in the biochemical structure of Bacteria and Archaea has been explained by researchers through evolutionary processes.[vague] It is theorized that both domains originated at deep sea alkaline hydrothermal vents. At least twice, microbes evolved lipid biosynthesis and cell wall biochemistry. It has been suggested that the last universal common ancestor was a non-free-living organism. It may have had a permeable membrane composed of bacterial simple chain amphiphiles (fatty acids), including archaeal simple chain amphiphiles (isoprenoids). These stabilize fatty acid membranes in seawater; this property may have driven the divergence of bacterial and archaeal membranes, ""with the later biosynthesis of phospholipids giving rise to the unique G1P and G3P headgroups of archaea and bacteria respectively. If so, the properties conferred by membrane isoprenoids place the lipid divide as early as the origin of life"". The relationships among the three domains are of central importance for understanding the origin of life. Most of the metabolic pathways, which are the object of the majority of an organism's genes, are common between Archaea and Bacteria, while most genes involved in genome expression are common between Archaea and Eukarya. Within prokaryotes, archaeal cell structure is most similar to that of gram-positive bacteria, largely because both have a single lipid bilayer and usually contain a thick sacculus (exoskeleton) of varying chemical composition. In some phylogenetic trees based upon different gene/protein sequences of prokaryotic homologs, the archaeal homologs are more closely related to those of gram-positive bacteria. Archaea and gram-positive bacteria also share conserved indels in a number of important proteins, such as Hsp70 and glutamine synthetase I; but the phylogeny of these genes was interpreted to reveal interdomain gene transfer, and might not reflect the organismal relationship(s). It has been proposed that the archaea evolved from Gram-positive bacteria in response to antibiotic selection pressure. This is suggested by the observation that archaea are resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics that are produced primarily by Gram-positive bacteria, and that these antibiotics act primarily on the genes that distinguish archaea from bacteria. The proposal is that the selective pressure towards resistance generated by the gram-positive antibiotics was eventually sufficient to cause extensive changes in many of the antibiotics' target genes, and that these strains represented the common ancestors of present-day Archaea. The evolution of Archaea in response to antibiotic selection, or any other competitive selective pressure, could also explain their adaptation to extreme environments (such as high temperature or acidity) as the result of a search for unoccupied niches to escape from antibiotic-producing organisms; Cavalier-Smith has made a similar suggestion, the Neomura hypothesis. This proposal is also supported by other work investigating protein structural relationships and studies that suggest that gram-positive bacteria may constitute the earliest branching lineages within the prokaryotes. The evolutionary relationship between archaea and eukaryotes remains unclear. Aside from the similarities in cell structure and function that are discussed below, many genetic trees group the two. Complicating factors include claims that the relationship between eukaryotes and the archaeal phylum Thermoproteota is closer than the relationship between the ""Euryarchaeota"" and the phylum Thermoproteota and the presence of archaea-like genes in certain bacteria, such as Thermotoga maritima, from horizontal gene transfer. The standard hypothesis states that the ancestor of the eukaryotes diverged early from the Archaea, and that eukaryotes arose through symbiogenesis, the fusion of an archaean and a eubacterium, which formed the mitochondria; this hypothesis explains the genetic similarities between the groups. The eocyte hypothesis instead posits that Eukaryota emerged relatively late from the Archaea. A lineage of archaea discovered in 2015, Lokiarchaeum (of the proposed new phylum ""Lokiarchaeota""), named for a hydrothermal vent called Loki's Castle in the Arctic Ocean, was found to be the most closely related to eukaryotes known at that time. It has been called a transitional organism between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Several sister phyla of ""Lokiarchaeota"" have since been found (""Thorarchaeota"", ""Odinarchaeota"", ""Heimdallarchaeota""), all together comprising a newly proposed supergroup ""Asgard"". Details of the relation of Promethearchaeati/""Asgard"" members and eukaryotes are still under consideration, although, in January 2020, scientists reported that Candidatus Prometheoarchaeum syntrophicum, a type of Promethearchaeati/""Asgard"" archaea, may be a possible link between simple prokaryotic and complex eukaryotic microorganisms about two billion years ago. Individual archaea range from 0.1 micrometers (μm) to over 15 μm in diameter, and occur in various shapes, commonly as spheres, rods, spirals or plates. Other morphologies in the Thermoproteota include irregularly shaped lobed cells in Sulfolobus, needle-like filaments that are less than half a micrometer in diameter in Thermofilum, and almost perfectly rectangular rods in Thermoproteus and Pyrobaculum. Archaea in the genus Haloquadratum such as Haloquadratum walsbyi are flat, square specimens that live in hypersaline pools. These unusual shapes are probably maintained by both their cell walls and a prokaryotic cytoskeleton. Proteins related to the cytoskeleton components of other organisms exist in archaea, and filaments form within their cells, but in contrast with other organisms, these cellular structures are poorly understood. In Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma the lack of a cell wall means that the cells have irregular shapes, and can resemble amoebae. Some species form aggregates or filaments of cells up to 200 μm long. These organisms can be prominent in biofilms. Notably, aggregates of Thermococcus coalescens cells fuse together in culture, forming single giant cells. Archaea in the genus Pyrodictium produce an elaborate multicell colony involving arrays of long, thin hollow tubes called cannulae that stick out from the cells' surfaces and connect them into a dense bush-like agglomeration. The function of these cannulae is not settled, but they may allow communication or nutrient exchange with neighbors. Multi-species colonies exist, such as the ""string-of-pearls"" community that was discovered in 2001 in a German swamp. Round whitish colonies of a novel Euryarchaeota species are spaced along thin filaments that can range up to 15 centimetres (5.9 in) long; these filaments are made of a particular bacteria species. Archaea and bacteria have generally similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like bacteria, archaea lack interior membranes and organelles. Like bacteria, the cell membranes of archaea are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using one or more flagella. Structurally, archaea are most similar to gram-positive bacteria. Most have a single plasma membrane and cell wall, and lack a periplasmic space; the exception to this general rule is Ignicoccus, which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane. Most archaea (but not Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma) possess a cell wall. In most archaea, the wall is assembled from surface-layer proteins, which form an S-layer. An S-layer is a rigid array of protein molecules that cover the outside of the cell (like chain mail). This layer provides both chemical and physical protection, and can prevent macromolecules from contacting the cell membrane. Unlike bacteria, archaea lack peptidoglycan in their cell walls. Methanobacteriales do have cell walls containing pseudopeptidoglycan, which resembles eubacterial peptidoglycan in morphology, function, and physical structure, but pseudopeptidoglycan is distinct in chemical structure; it lacks D-amino acids and N-acetylmuramic acid, substituting the latter with N-Acetyltalosaminuronic acid. Archaeal flagella are known as archaella, that operate like bacterial flagella – their long stalks are driven by rotatory motors at the base. These motors are powered by a proton gradient across the membrane, but archaella are notably different in composition and development. The two types of flagella evolved from different ancestors. The bacterial flagellum shares a common ancestor with the type III secretion system, while archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from bacterial type IV pili. In contrast with the bacterial flagellum, which is hollow and assembled by subunits moving up the central pore to the tip of the flagella, archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits at the base. Archaeal membranes are made of molecules that are distinctly different from those in all other life forms, showing that archaea are related only distantly to bacteria and eukaryotes. In all organisms, cell membranes are made of molecules known as phospholipids. These molecules possess both a polar part that dissolves in water (the phosphate ""head""), and a ""greasy"" non-polar part that does not (the lipid tail). These dissimilar parts are connected by a glycerol moiety. In water, phospholipids cluster, with the heads facing the water and the tails facing away from it. The major structure in cell membranes is a double layer of these phospholipids, which is called a lipid bilayer. The phospholipids of archaea are unusual in four ways: Archaea exhibit a great variety of chemical reactions in their metabolism and use many sources of energy. These reactions are classified into nutritional groups, depending on energy and carbon sources. Some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia (they are chemotrophs). These include nitrifiers, methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers. In these reactions, one compound passes electrons to another (in a redox reaction), releasing energy to fuel the cell's activities. One compound acts as an electron donor and one as an electron acceptor. The energy released is used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through chemiosmosis, the same basic process that happens in the mitochondrion of eukaryotic cells. Other groups of archaea use sunlight as a source of energy (they are phototrophs), but oxygen–generating photosynthesis does not occur in any of these organisms. Many basic metabolic pathways are shared among all forms of life; for example, archaea use a modified form of glycolysis (the Entner–Doudoroff pathway) and either a complete or partial citric acid cycle. These similarities to other organisms probably reflect both early origins in the history of life and their high level of efficiency. Some Euryarchaeota are methanogens (archaea that produce methane as a result of metabolism) living in anaerobic environments, such as swamps. This form of metabolism evolved early, and it is even possible that the first free-living organism was a methanogen. A common reaction involves the use of carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor to oxidize hydrogen. Methanogenesis involves a range of coenzymes that are unique to these archaea, such as coenzyme M and methanofuran. Other organic compounds such as alcohols, acetic acid or formic acid are used as alternative electron acceptors by methanogens. These reactions are common in gut-dwelling archaea. Acetic acid is also broken down into methane and carbon dioxide directly, by acetotrophic archaea. These acetotrophs are archaea in the order Methanosarcinales, and are a major part of the communities of microorganisms that produce biogas. Other archaea use CO2 in the atmosphere as a source of carbon, in a process called carbon fixation (they are autotrophs). This process involves either a highly modified form of the Calvin cycle or another metabolic pathway called the 3-hydroxypropionate/ 4-hydroxybutyrate cycle. The Thermoproteota also use the reverse Krebs cycle while the ""Euryarchaeota"" also use the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway. Carbon fixation is powered by inorganic energy sources. No known archaea carry out photosynthesis. Archaeal energy sources are extremely diverse, and range from the oxidation of ammonia by the Nitrosopumilales to the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide or elemental sulfur by species of Sulfolobus, using either oxygen or metal ions as electron acceptors. Phototrophic archaea use light to produce chemical energy in the form of ATP. In the Halobacteria, light-activated ion pumps like bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin generate ion gradients by pumping ions out of and into the cell across the plasma membrane. The energy stored in these electrochemical gradients is then converted into ATP by ATP synthase. This process is a form of photophosphorylation. The ability of these light-driven pumps to move ions across membranes depends on light-driven changes in the structure of a retinol cofactor buried in the center of the protein. Archaea usually have a single circular chromosome, but many euryarchaea have been shown to bear multiple copies of this chromosome. The largest known archaeal genome as of 2002 was 5,751,492 base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans. The tiny 490,885 base-pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact, in a process that may be similar to bacterial conjugation. Archaea are genetically distinct from bacteria and eukaryotes, with up to 15% of the proteins encoded by any one archaeal genome being unique to the domain, although most of these unique genes have no known function. Of the remainder of the unique proteins that have an identified function, most belong to the Euryarchaeota and are involved in methanogenesis. The proteins that archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes share form a common core of cell function, relating mostly to transcription, translation, and nucleotide metabolism. Other characteristic archaeal features are the organization of genes of related function – such as enzymes that catalyze steps in the same metabolic pathway into novel operons, and large differences in tRNA genes and their aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. Transcription in archaea more closely resembles eukaryotic than bacterial transcription, with the archaeal RNA polymerase being very close to its equivalent in eukaryotes, while archaeal translation shows signs of both bacterial and eukaryotic equivalents. Although archaea have only one type of RNA polymerase, its structure and function in transcription seems to be close to that of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, with similar protein assemblies (the general transcription factors) directing the binding of the RNA polymerase to a gene's promoter, but other archaeal transcription factors are closer to those found in bacteria. Post-transcriptional modification is simpler than in eukaryotes, since most archaeal genes lack introns, although there are many introns in their transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA genes, and introns may occur in a few protein-encoding genes. Haloferax volcanii, an extreme halophilic archaeon, forms cytoplasmic bridges between cells that appear to be used for transfer of DNA from one cell to another in ei",Wiki
Arteriovenous_malformation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation,"An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an abnormal connection between arteries and veins, bypassing the capillary system. Usually congenital, this vascular anomaly is widely known because of its occurrence in the central nervous system (usually as a cerebral AVM), but can appear anywhere in the body. The symptoms of AVMs can range from none at all to intense pain or bleeding, and they can lead to other serious medical problems. Symptoms of AVMs vary according to their location. Most neurological AVMs produce few to no symptoms. Often the malformation is discovered as part of an autopsy or during treatment of an unrelated disorder (an ""incidental finding""); in rare cases, its expansion or a micro-bleed from an AVM in the brain can cause epilepsy, neurological deficit, or pain. The most general symptoms of a cerebral AVM include headaches and epileptic seizures, with more specific symptoms that normally depend on its location and the individual, including: Cerebral AVMs may present themselves in a number of different ways:[citation needed] Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations are abnormal communications between the veins and arteries of the pulmonary circulation, leading to a right-to-left blood shunt. They have no symptoms in up to 29% of all cases, however they can give rise to serious complications including hemorrhage, and infection. They are most commonly associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. AVMs are usually congenital and are part of the RASopathy family of developmental syndromes. The understanding of the anomaly's genetic transmission patterns are incomplete, but there are known genetic mutations (for instance in the epithelial line, tumor suppressor PTEN gene) which can lead to an increased occurrence throughout the body.[citation needed] The anomaly can occur due to autosomal dominant diseases, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In the circulatory system, arteries carry blood away from the heart to the lungs and the rest of the body, where the blood normally passes through capillaries—where oxygen is released and waste products like carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbed—before veins return blood to the heart. An AVM interferes with this process by forming a direct connection of the arteries and veins, bypassing the capillary bed. AVMs can cause intense pain and lead to serious medical problems. Although AVMs are often associated with the brain and spinal cord, they can develop in other parts of the body. As an AVM lacks the dampening effect of capillaries on the blood flow, the AVM can get progressively larger over time as the amount of blood flowing through it increases, forcing the heart to work harder to keep up with the extra blood flow. It also causes the surrounding area to be deprived of the functions of the capillaries. The resulting tangle of blood vessels, often called a nidus (Latin for 'nest'), has no capillaries. It can be extremely fragile and prone to bleeding because of the abnormally direct connections between high-pressure arteries and low-pressure veins. One indicator is a pulsing 'whoosh' sound caused by rapid blood flow through arteries and veins, which has been given the term bruit (French for 'noise'). If the AVM is severe, this may produce an audible symptom which can interfere with hearing and sleep as well as cause psychological distress. AVMs are diagnosed primarily by the following imaging methods: AVMs can occur in various parts of the body: AVMs may occur in isolation or as a part of another disease (for example, Sturge-Weber syndrome or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia). AVMs have been shown to be associated with aortic stenosis. Bleeding from an AVM can be relatively mild or devastating. It can cause severe and less often fatal strokes. Treatment for AVMs in the brain can be symptomatic, and patients should be followed by a neurologist for any seizures, headaches, or focal neurologic deficits. AVM-specific treatment may also involve endovascular embolization, neurosurgery or radiosurgery. Embolization, that is, cutting off the blood supply to the AVM with coils, particles, acrylates, or polymers introduced by a radiographically guided catheter, may be used in addition to neurosurgery or radiosurgery, but is rarely successful in isolation except in smaller AVMs. A gamma knife may also be used. If a cerebral AVM is detected before a stroke occurs, usually the arteries feeding blood into the nidus can be closed off to avert the danger. Interventional therapy may be relatively risky in the short term. Treatment of lung AVMs is typically performed with endovascular embolization alone, which is considered the standard of care. The estimated detection rate of AVM in the US general population is 1.4/100,000 per year. This is approximately one-fifth to one-seventh the incidence of intracranial aneurysms. An estimated 300,000 Americans have AVMs, of whom 12% (approximately 36,000) will exhibit symptoms of greatly varying severity. Hubert von Luschka (1820–1875) and Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902) first described arteriovenous malformations in the mid-1800s. Herbert Olivecrona (1891–1980) performed the first surgical excision of an intracranial AVM in 1932.",Wiki
Astrobiology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology,"Astrobiology (also xenology or exobiology) is a scientific field within the life and environmental sciences that studies the origins, early evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe by investigating its deterministic conditions and contingent events. As a discipline, astrobiology is founded on the premise that life may exist beyond Earth. Research in astrobiology comprises three main areas: the study of habitable environments in the Solar System and beyond, the search for planetary biosignatures of past or present extraterrestrial life, and the study of the origin and early evolution of life on Earth. The field of astrobiology has its origins in the 20th century with the advent of space exploration and the discovery of exoplanets. Early astrobiology research focused on the search for extraterrestrial life and the study of the potential for life to exist on other planets. In the 1960s and 1970s, NASA began its astrobiology pursuits within the Viking program, which was the first US mission to land on Mars and search for signs of life. This mission, along with other early space exploration missions, laid the foundation for the development of astrobiology as a discipline. Regarding habitable environments, astrobiology investigates potential locations beyond Earth that could support life, such as Mars, Europa, and exoplanets, through research into the extremophiles populating austere environments on Earth, like volcanic and deep sea environments. Research within this topic is conducted utilising the methodology of the geosciences, especially geobiology, for astrobiological applications. The search for biosignatures involves the identification of signs of past or present life in the form of organic compounds, isotopic ratios, or microbial fossils. Research within this topic is conducted utilising the methodology of planetary and environmental science, especially atmospheric science, for astrobiological applications, and is often conducted through remote sensing and in situ missions. Astrobiology also concerns the study of the origin and early evolution of life on Earth to try to understand the conditions that are necessary for life to form on other planets. This research seeks to understand how life emerged from non-living matter and how it evolved to become the diverse array of organisms we see today. Research within this topic is conducted utilising the methodology of paleosciences, especially paleobiology, for astrobiological applications. Astrobiology is a rapidly developing field with a strong interdisciplinary aspect that holds many challenges and opportunities for scientists. Astrobiology programs and research centres are present in many universities and research institutions around the world, and space agencies like NASA and ESA have dedicated departments and programs for astrobiology research. The term astrobiology was first proposed by the Russian astronomer Gavriil Tikhov in 1953. It is etymologically derived from the Greek ἄστρον, ""star""; βίος, ""life""; and -λογία, -logia, ""study"". A close synonym is exobiology from the Greek Έξω, ""external""; βίος, ""life""; and -λογία, -logia, ""study"", coined by American molecular biologist Joshua Lederberg; exobiology is considered to have a narrow scope limited to search of life external to Earth. Another associated term is xenobiology, from the Greek ξένος, ""foreign""; βίος, ""life""; and -λογία, ""study"", coined by American science fiction writer Robert Heinlein in his work The Star Beast; xenobiology is now used in a more specialised sense, referring to 'biology based on foreign chemistry', whether of extraterrestrial or terrestrial (typically synthetic) origin. While the potential for extraterrestrial life, especially intelligent life, has been explored throughout human history within philosophy and narrative, the question is a verifiable hypothesis and thus a valid line of scientific inquiry; planetary scientist David Grinspoon calls it a field of natural philosophy, grounding speculation on the unknown in known scientific theory. The modern field of astrobiology can be traced back to the 1950s and 1960s with the advent of space exploration, when scientists began to seriously consider the possibility of life on other planets. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, which marked the beginning of the Space Age. This event led to an increase in the study of the potential for life on other planets, as scientists began to consider the possibilities opened up by the new technology of space exploration. In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiology project, and in 1960, NASA founded the Exobiology Program, now one of four main elements of NASA's current Astrobiology Program. In 1971, NASA funded Project Cyclops, part of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, to search radio frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum for interstellar communications transmitted by extraterrestrial life outside the Solar System. In the 1960s-1970s, NASA established the Viking program, which was the first US mission to land on Mars and search for metabolic signs of present life; the results were inconclusive. In the 1980s and 1990s, the field began to expand and diversify as new discoveries and technologies emerged. The discovery of microbial life in extreme environments on Earth, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents, helped to clarify the feasibility of potential life existing in harsh conditions. The development of new techniques for the detection of biosignatures, such as the use of stable isotopes, also played a significant role in the evolution of the field. The contemporary landscape of astrobiology emerged in the early 21st century, focused on utilising Earth and environmental science for applications within comparate space environments. Missions included the ESA's Beagle 2, which failed minutes after landing on Mars, NASA's Phoenix lander, which probed the environment for past and present planetary habitability of microbial life on Mars and researched the history of water, and NASA's Curiosity rover, currently probing the environment for past and present planetary habitability of microbial life on Mars. Astrobiological research makes a number of simplifying assumptions when studying the necessary components for planetary habitability. Carbon and Organic Compounds: Carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe and the energy required to make or break a bond is at just the appropriate level for building molecules which are not only stable, but also reactive. The fact that carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms allows for the building of extremely long and complex molecules. As such, astrobiological research presumes that the vast majority of life forms in the Milky Way galaxy are based on carbon chemistries, as are all life forms on Earth. However, theoretical astrobiology entertains the potential for other organic molecular bases for life, thus astrobiological research often focuses on identifying environments that have the potential to support life based on the presence of organic compounds. Liquid water: Liquid water is a common molecule that provides an excellent environment for the formation of complicated carbon-based molecules, and is generally considered necessary for life as we know it to exist. Thus, astrobiological research presumes that extraterrestrial life similarly depends upon access to liquid water, and often focuses on identifying environments that have the potential to support liquid water. Some researchers posit environments of water-ammonia mixtures as possible solvents for hypothetical types of biochemistry. Environmental stability: Where organisms adaptively evolve to the conditions of the environments in which they reside, environmental stability is considered necessary for life to exist. This presupposes the necessity of a stable temperature, pressure, and radiation levels; resultantly, astrobiological research focuses on planets orbiting Sun-like red dwarf stars. This is because very large stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life might not have time to emerge on planets orbiting them; very small stars provide so little heat and warmth that only planets in very close orbits around them would not be frozen solid, and in such close orbits these planets would be tidally locked to the star; whereas the long lifetimes of red dwarfs could allow the development of habitable environments on planets with thick atmospheres. This is significant as red dwarfs are extremely common. (See also: Habitability of red dwarf systems). Energy source: It is assumed that any life elsewhere in the universe would also require an energy source. Previously, it was assumed that this would necessarily be from a sun-like star, however with developments within extremophile research contemporary astrobiological research often focuses on identifying environments that have the potential to support life based on the availability of an energy source, such as the presence of volcanic activity on a planet or moon that could provide a source of heat and energy. It is important to note that these assumptions are based on our current understanding of life on Earth and the conditions under which it can exist. As our understanding of life and the potential for it to exist in different environments evolves, these assumptions may change. Astrobiological research concerning the study of habitable environments in our solar system and beyond utilises methods within the geosciences. Research within this branch primarily concerns the geobiology of organisms that can survive in extreme environments on Earth, such as in volcanic or deep sea environments, to understand the limits of life, and the conditions under which life might be able to survive on other planets. This includes, but is not limited to: Deep-sea extremophiles: Researchers are studying organisms that live in the extreme environments of deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. These organisms survive in the absence of sunlight, and some are able to survive in high temperatures and pressures, and use chemical energy instead of sunlight to produce food. Desert extremophiles: Researchers are studying organisms that can survive in extreme dry, high temperature conditions, such as in deserts. Microbes in extreme environments: Researchers are investigating the diversity and activity of microorganisms in environments such as deep mines, subsurface soil, cold glaciers and polar ice, and high-altitude environments. Research also regards the long-term survival of life on Earth, and the possibilities and hazards of life on other planets, including: Biodiversity and ecosystem resilience: Scientists are studying how the diversity of life and the interactions between different species contribute to the resilience of ecosystems and their ability to recover from disturbances. Climate change and extinction: Researchers are investigating the impacts of climate change on different species and ecosystems, and how they may lead to extinction or adaptation. This includes the evolution of Earth's climate and geology, and their potential impact on the habitability of the planet in the future, especially for humans. Human impact on the biosphere: Scientists are studying the ways in which human activities, such as deforestation, pollution, and the introduction of invasive species, are affecting the biosphere and the long-term survival of life on Earth. Long-term preservation of life: Researchers are exploring ways to preserve samples of life on Earth for long periods of time, such as cryopreservation and genomic preservation, in the event of a catastrophic event that could wipe out most of life on Earth. Emerging astrobiological research concerning the search for planetary biosignatures of past or present extraterrestrial life utilise methodologies within planetary sciences. These include: The study of microbial life in the subsurface of Mars: Scientists are using data from Mars rover missions to study the composition of the subsurface of Mars, searching for biosignatures of past or present microbial life. The study of liquid bodies on icy moons: Discoveries of surface and subsurface bodies of liquid on moons such as Europa, Titan and Enceladus showed possible habitability zones, making them viable targets for the search for extraterrestrial life. As of September 2024[update], missions like Europa Clipper and Dragonfly are planned to search for biosignatures within these environments. The study of the atmospheres of planets: Scientists are studying the potential for life to exist in the atmospheres of planets, with a focus on the study of the physical and chemical conditions necessary for such life to exist, namely the detection of organic molecules and biosignature gases; for example, the study of the possibility of life in the atmospheres of exoplanets that orbit red dwarfs and the study of the potential for microbial life in the upper atmosphere of Venus. Telescopes and remote sensing of exoplanets: The discovery of thousands of exoplanets has opened up new opportunities for the search for biosignatures. Scientists are using telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to search for biosignatures on exoplanets. They are also developing new techniques for the detection of biosignatures, such as the use of remote sensing to search for biosignatures in the atmosphere of exoplanets. Scientists search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations using radio and optical telescopes within the discipline of extraterrestrial intelligence communications (CETI). CETI focuses on composing and deciphering messages that could theoretically be understood by another technological civilization. Communication attempts by humans have included broadcasting mathematical languages, pictorial systems such as the Arecibo message, and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering 'natural' language communication. While some high-profile scientists, such as Carl Sagan, have advocated the transmission of messages, theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking warned against it, suggesting that aliens may raid Earth for its resources. Emerging astrobiological research concerning the study of the origin and early evolution of life on Earth utilises methodologies within the palaeosciences. These include: The study of the early atmosphere: Researchers are investigating the role of the early atmosphere in providing the right conditions for the emergence of life, such as the presence of gases that could have helped to stabilise the climate and the formation of organic molecules. The study of the early magnetic field: Researchers are investigating the role of the early magnetic field in protecting the Earth from harmful radiation and helping to stabilise the climate. This research has immense astrobiological implications where the subjects of current astrobiological research like Mars lack such a field. The study of prebiotic chemistry: Scientists are studying the chemical reactions that could have occurred on the early Earth that led to the formation of the building blocks of life- amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids- and how these molecules could have formed spontaneously under early Earth conditions. The study of impact events: Scientists are investigating the potential role of impact events- especially meteorites- in the delivery of water and organic molecules to early Earth. The study of the primordial soup: Researchers are investigating the conditions and ingredients that were present on the early Earth that could have led to the formation of the first living organisms, such as the presence of water and organic molecules, and how these ingredients could have led to the formation of the first living organisms. This includes the role of water in the formation of the first cells and in catalysing chemical reactions. The study of the role of minerals: Scientists are investigating the role of minerals like clay in catalysing the formation of organic molecules, thus playing a role in the emergence of life on Earth. The study of the role of energy and electricity: Scientists are investigating the potential sources of energy and electricity that could have been available on the early Earth, and their role in the formation of organic molecules, thus the emergence of life. The study of the early oceans: Scientists are investigating the composition and chemistry of the early oceans and how it may have played a role in the emergence of life, such as the presence of dissolved minerals that could have helped to catalyse the formation of organic molecules. The study of hydrothermal vents: Scientists are investigating the potential role of hydrothermal vents in the origin of life, as these environments may have provided the energy and chemical building blocks needed for its emergence. The study of plate tectonics: Scientists are investigating the role of plate tectonics in creating a diverse range of environments on the early Earth. The study of the early biosphere: Researchers are investigating the diversity and activity of microorganisms in the early Earth, and how these organisms may have played a role in the emergence of life. The study of microbial fossils: Scientists are investigating the presence of microbial fossils in ancient rocks, which can provide clues about the early evolution of life on Earth and the emergence of the first organisms. The systematic search for possible life outside Earth is a valid multidisciplinary scientific endeavor. However, hypotheses and predictions as to its existence and origin vary widely, and at the present, the development of hypotheses firmly grounded on science may be considered astrobiology's most concrete practical application. It has been proposed that viruses are likely to be encountered on other life-bearing planets, and may be present even if there are no biological cells. As of 2024[update], no evidence of extraterrestrial life has been identified. Examination of the Allan Hills 84001 meteorite, which was recovered in Antarctica in 1984 and originated from Mars, is thought by David McKay, as well as few other scientists, to contain microfossils of extraterrestrial origin; this interpretation is controversial. Yamato 000593, the second largest meteorite from Mars, was found on Earth in 2000. At a microscopic level, spheres are found in the meteorite that are rich in carbon compared to surrounding areas that lack such spheres. The carbon-rich spheres may have been formed by biotic activity according to some NASA scientists. On 5 March 2011, Richard B. Hoover, a scientist with the Marshall Space Flight Center, speculated on the finding of alleged microfossils similar to cyanobacteria in CI1 carbonaceous meteorites in the fringe Journal of Cosmology, a story widely reported on by mainstream media. However, NASA formally distanced itself from Hoover's claim. According to American astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson: ""At the moment, life on Earth is the only known life in the universe, but there are compelling arguments to suggest we are not alone."" Most astronomy-related astrobiology research falls into the category of extrasolar planet (exoplanet) detection, the hypothesis being that if life arose on Earth, then it could also arise on other planets with similar characteristics. To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets have been considered, most notably NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and ESA's Darwin programs, both of which have been cancelled. NASA launched the Kepler mission in March 2009, and the French Space Agency launched the COROT space mission in 2006. There are also several less ambitious ground-based efforts underway. The goal of these missions is not only to detect Earth-sized planets but also to directly detect light from the planet so that it may be studied spectroscopically. By examining planetary spectra, it would be possible to determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere and/or surface. Given this knowledge, it may be possible to assess the likelihood of life being found on that planet. A NASA research group, the Virtual Planet Laboratory, is using computer modeling to generate a wide variety of virtual planets to see what they would look like if viewed by TPF or Darwin. It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with these virtual planetary spectra for features that might indicate the presence of life. An estimate for the number of planets with intelligent communicative extraterrestrial life can be gleaned from the Drake equation, essentially an equation expressing the probability of intelligent life as the product of factors such as the fraction of planets that might be habitable and the fraction of planets on which life might arise: where: However, whilst the rationale behind the equation is sound, it is unlikely that the equation will be constrained to reasonable limits of error any time soon. The problem with the formula is that it is not used to generate or support hypotheses because it contains factors that can never be verified. The first term, R*, number of stars, is generally constrained within a few orders of magnitude. The second and third terms, fp, stars with planets and fe, planets with habitable conditions, are being evaluated for the star's neighborhood. Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference, but some applications of the formula had been taken literally and related to simplistic or pseudoscientific arguments. Another associated topic is the Fermi paradox, which suggests that if intelligent life is common in the universe, then there should be obvious signs of it. Another active research area in astrobiology is planetary system formation. It has been suggested that the peculiarities of the Solar System (for example, the presence of Jupiter as a protective shield) may have greatly increased the probability of intelligent life arising on Earth. Biology cannot state that a process or phenomenon, by being mathematically possible, has to exist forcibly in an extraterrestrial body. Biologists specify what is speculative and what is not. The discovery of extremophiles, organisms able to survive in extreme environments, became a core research element for astrobiologists, as they are important to understand four areas in the limits of life in planetary context: the potential for panspermia, forward contamination due to human exploration ventures, planetary colonization by humans, and the exploration of extinct and extant extraterrestrial life. Until the 1970s, life was thought to be entirely dependent on energy from the Sun. Plants on Earth's surface capture energy from sunlight to photosynthesize sugars from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen in the process that is then consumed by oxygen-respiring organisms, passing their energy up the food chain. Even life in the ocean depths, where sunlight cannot reach, was thought to obtain its nourishment either from consuming organic detritus rained down from the surface waters or from eating animals that did. The world's ability to support life was thought to depend on its access to sunlight. However, in 1977, during an exploratory dive to the Galapagos Rift in the deep-sea exploration submersible Alvin, scientists discovered colonies of giant tube worms, clams, crustaceans, mussels, and other assorted creatures clustered around undersea volcanic features known as black smokers. These creatures thrive despite having no access to sunlight, and it was soon discovered that they form an entirely independent ecosystem. Although most of these multicellular lifeforms need dissolved oxygen (produced by oxygenic photosynthesis) for their aerobic cellular respiration and thus are not completely independent from sunlight by themselves, the basis for their food chain is a form of bacterium that derives its energy from oxidization of reactive chemicals, such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, that bubble up from the Earth's interior. Other lifeforms entirely decoupled from the energy from sunlight are green sulfur bacteria which are capturing geothermal light for anoxygenic photosynthesis or bacteria running chemolithoautotrophy based on the radioactive decay of uranium. This chemosynthesis revolutionized the study of biology and astrobiology by revealing that life need not be sunlight-dependent; it only requires water and an energy gradient in order to exist. Biologists have found extremophiles that thrive in ice, boiling water, acid, alkali, the water core of nuclear reactors, salt crystals, toxic waste and in a range of other extreme habitats that were previously thought to be inhospitable for life. This opened up a new avenue in astrobiology by massively expanding the number of possible extraterrestrial habitats. Characterization of these organisms, their environments and their evolutionary pathways, is considered a crucial component to understanding how life might evolve elsewhere in the universe. For example, some organisms able to withstand exposure to the vacuum and radiation of outer space include the lichen fungi Rhizocarpon geographicum and Rusavskia elegans, the bacterium Bacillus safensis, Deinococcus radiodurans, Bacillus subtilis, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, seeds from Arabidopsis thaliana ('mouse-ear cress'), as well as the invertebrate animal Tardigrade. While tardigrades are not considered true extremophiles, they are considered extremotolerant microorganisms that have contributed to the field of astrobiology. Their extreme radiation tolerance and presence of DNA protection proteins may provide answers as to whether life can survive away from the protection of the Earth's atmosphere. Jupiter's moon, Europa, and Saturn's moon, Enceladus, are now considered the most likely locations for extant extraterrestrial life in the Solar System due to their subsurface water oceans where radiogenic and tidal heating enables liquid water to exist. The origin of life, known as abiogenesis, distinct from the evolution of life, is another ongoing field of research. Oparin and Haldane postulated that the conditions on the early Earth were conducive to the formation of organic compounds from inorganic elements and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life we see today. The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, has made some progress, but it is still unclear whether or not life could have formed in such a manner on Earth. The alternative hypothesis of panspermia is that the first elements of life may have formed on another planet with even more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then have been carried over to Earth. The cosmic dust permeating the universe contains complex organic compounds (""amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic-aliphatic structure"") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars. Further, a scientist suggested that these compounds may have been related to the development of life on Earth and said that, ""If this is the case, life on Earth may have had an easier time getting started as these organics can serve as basic ingredients for life."" More than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets. PAHs are subjected to interstellar medium conditions and are transformed through hydrogenation, oxygenation and hydroxylation, to more complex organics—""a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively"". In October 2020, astronomers proposed the idea of detecting life on distant planets by studying the shadows of trees at certain times of the day to find patterns that could be detected through observation of exoplanets. David Grinspoon called astrobiology a field of natural philosophy. Astrobiology intersects with philosophy by raising questions about the nature and existence of life beyond Earth. Philosophical implications include the definition of life itself, issues in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science in case intelligent life is found, epistemological questions about the nature of proof, ethical considerations of space exploration, along with the broader impact of discovering extraterrestrial life on human thought and society. Dunér has emphasized philosophy of astrobiology as an ongoing existential exercise in individual and collective self-understanding, whose major task is constructing and debating concepts such as the concept of life. Key issues, for Dunér, are questions of resource money and monetary planning, epistemological questions regarding astrobiological knowledge, linguistics issues about interstellar communication, cognitive issues such as the definition of intelligence, along with the possibility of interplanetary contamination. Persson also emphasized key philosophical questions in astrobiology. They include ethical justification of resources, the question of life in general, the epistemological issues and knowledge about being alone in the universe, ethics towards extraterrestrial life, the question of politics and governing uninhabited worlds, along with questions of ecology. For von Hegner, the question of astrobiology and the possibility of astrophilosophy differs. For him, the discipline needs to bifurcate into astrobiology and astrophilosophy since discussions made possible by astrobiology, but which have been astrophilosophical in nature, have existed as long as there have been discussions about extraterrestrial life. Astrobiology is a self-corrective interaction among observation, hypothesis, experiment, and theory, pertaining to the exploration of all natural phenomena. Astrophilosophy consists of methods of dialectic analysis and logical argumentation, pertaining to the clarification of the nature of reality. Šekrst argues that astrobiology requires the affirmation of astrophilosophy, but not as a separate cognate to astrobiology. The stance of conceptual speciesm, according to Šekrst, permeates astrobiology since the very name astrobiology tries to talk about not just biology, but about life in a general way, which includes terrestrial life as a subset. This leads us to either redefine philosophy, or consider the need for astrophilosophy as a more general discipline, to which philosophy is just a subset that deals with questions such as the nature of the human mind and other anthropocentric questions. Most of the philosophy of astrobiology deals with two main questions: the question of life and the ethics of space exploration. Kolb specifically emphasizes the question of viruses, for which the question whether they are alive or not is based on the definitions of life that include self-replication. Schneider tried to defined exo-life, but concluded that we often start with our own prejudices and that defining extraterrestrial life seems futile using human concepts. For Dick, astrobiology relies on metaphysical assumption that there is extraterrestrial life, which reaffirms questions in the philosophy of cosmology, such as fine-tuning or the anthropic principle. The Rare Earth hypothesis postulates that multicellular life forms found on Earth may actually be more of a rarity than scientists assume. According to this hypothesis, life on Earth (and more, multi-cellular life) is possible because of a conjunction of the right circumstances (galaxy and location within it, planetary system, star, orbit, planetary size, atmosphere, etc.); and the chance for all those circumstances to repeat elsewhere may be rare. It provides a possible answer to the Fermi paradox which wonders: if extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious? It is apparently in opposition to the principle of mediocrity,",Wiki
Atom,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom,"Atoms are the basic particles of the chemical elements. An atom consists of a nucleus of protons and generally neutrons, surrounded by an electromagnetically bound swarm of electrons. The chemical elements are distinguished from each other by the number of protons that are in their atoms. For example, any atom that contains 11 protons is sodium, and any atom that contains 29 protons is copper. Atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons are called isotopes of the same element. Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across. A human hair is about a million carbon atoms wide. Atoms are smaller than the shortest wavelength of visible light, which means humans cannot see atoms with conventional microscopes. They are so small that accurately predicting their behavior using classical physics is not possible due to quantum effects. More than 99.9994% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. Protons have a positive electric charge and neutrons have no charge, so the nucleus is positively charged. The electrons are negatively charged, and this opposing charge is what binds them to the nucleus. If the numbers of protons and electrons are equal, as they normally are, then the atom is electrically neutral as a whole. If an atom has more electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative charge and is called a negative ion (or anion). Conversely, if it has more protons than electrons, it has a positive charge and is called a positive ion (or cation). The electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the electromagnetic force. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by the nuclear force. This force is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force that repels the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force. In this case, the nucleus splits and leaves behind different elements. This is a form of nuclear decay. Atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by chemical bonds to form chemical compounds such as molecules or crystals. The ability of atoms to attach and detach from each other is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature. Chemistry is the science that studies these changes. The basic idea that matter is made up of tiny indivisible particles is an old idea that appeared in many ancient cultures. The word atom is derived from the ancient Greek word atomos,[a] which means ""uncuttable"". But this ancient idea was based in philosophical reasoning rather than scientific reasoning. Modern atomic theory is not based on these old concepts. In the early 19th century, the scientist John Dalton found evidence that matter really is composed of discrete units, and so applied the word atom to those units. In the early 1800s, John Dalton compiled experimental data gathered by him and other scientists and discovered a pattern now known as the ""law of multiple proportions"". He noticed that in any group of chemical compounds which all contain two particular chemical elements, the amount of Element A per measure of Element B will differ across these compounds by ratios of small whole numbers. This pattern suggested that each element combines with other elements in multiples of a basic unit of weight, with each element having a unit of unique weight. Dalton decided to call these units ""atoms"". For example, there are two types of tin oxide: one is a grey powder that is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen, and the other is a white powder that is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen. Adjusting these figures, in the grey powder there is about 13.5 g of oxygen for every 100 g of tin, and in the white powder there is about 27 g of oxygen for every 100 g of tin. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2. Dalton concluded that in the grey oxide there is one atom of oxygen for every atom of tin, and in the white oxide there are two atoms of oxygen for every atom of tin (SnO and SnO2). Dalton also analyzed iron oxides. There is one type of iron oxide that is a black powder which is 78.1% iron and 21.9% oxygen; and there is another iron oxide that is a red powder which is 70.4% iron and 29.6% oxygen. Adjusting these figures, in the black powder there is about 28 g of oxygen for every 100 g of iron, and in the red powder there is about 42 g of oxygen for every 100 g of iron. 28 and 42 form a ratio of 2:3. Dalton concluded that in these oxides, for every two atoms of iron, there are two or three atoms of oxygen respectively. These substances are known today as iron(II) oxide and iron(III) oxide, and their formulas are FeO and Fe2O3 respectively. Iron(II) oxide's formula is normally written as FeO, but since it is a crystalline substance we could alternately write it as Fe2O2, and when we contrast that with Fe2O3, the 2:3 ratio for the oxygen is plain to see. As a final example: nitrous oxide is 63.3% nitrogen and 36.7% oxygen, nitric oxide is 44.05% nitrogen and 55.95% oxygen, and nitrogen dioxide is 29.5% nitrogen and 70.5% oxygen. Adjusting these figures, in nitrous oxide there is 80 g of oxygen for every 140 g of nitrogen, in nitric oxide there is about 160 g of oxygen for every 140 g of nitrogen, and in nitrogen dioxide there is 320 g of oxygen for every 140 g of nitrogen. 80, 160, and 320 form a ratio of 1:2:4. The respective formulas for these oxides are N2O, NO, and NO2. In 1897, J. J. Thomson discovered that cathode rays can be deflected by electric and magnetic fields, which meant that cathode rays are not a form of light but made of electrically charged particles, and their charge was negative given the direction the particles were deflected in. He measured these particles to be 1,700 times lighter than hydrogen (the lightest atom). He called these new particles corpuscles but they were later renamed electrons since these are the particles that carry electricity. Thomson also showed that electrons were identical to particles given off by photoelectric and radioactive materials. Thomson explained that an electric current is the passing of electrons from one atom to the next, and when there was no current the electrons embedded themselves in the atoms. This in turn meant that atoms were not indivisible as scientists thought. The atom was composed of electrons whose negative charge was balanced out by some source of positive charge to create an electrically neutral atom. Ions, Thomson explained, must be atoms which have an excess or shortage of electrons. The electrons in the atom logically had to be balanced out by a commensurate amount of positive charge, but Thomson had no idea where this positive charge came from, so he tentatively proposed that it was everywhere in the atom, the atom being in the shape of a sphere. This was the mathematically simplest hypothesis to fit the available evidence, or lack thereof. Following from this, Thomson imagined that the balance of electrostatic forces would distribute the electrons throughout the sphere in a more or less even manner. Thomson's model is popularly known as the plum pudding model, though neither Thomson nor his colleagues used this analogy. Thomson's model was incomplete, it was unable to predict any other properties of the elements such as emission spectra and valencies. It was soon rendered obsolete by the discovery of the atomic nucleus. Between 1908 and 1913, Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden performed a series of experiments in which they bombarded thin foils of metal with a beam of alpha particles. They did this to measure the scattering patterns of the alpha particles. They spotted a small number of alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°. This shouldn't have been possible according to the Thomson model of the atom, whose charges were too diffuse to produce a sufficiently strong electric field. The deflections should have all been negligible. Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny volume at the center of the atom and that the electrons surround this nucleus in a diffuse cloud. This nucleus carried almost all of the atom's mass. Only such an intense concentration of charge, anchored by its high mass, could produce an electric field that could deflect the alpha particles so strongly. A problem in classical mechanics is that an accelerating charged particle radiates electromagnetic radiation, causing the particle to lose kinetic energy. Circular motion counts as acceleration, which means that an electron orbiting a central charge should spiral down into that nucleus as it loses speed. In 1913, the physicist Niels Bohr proposed a new model in which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only do so in a finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization was used to explain why the electrons' orbits are stable and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra. Bohr's model could only predict the emission spectra of hydrogen, not atoms with more than one electron. Back in 1815, William Prout observed that the atomic weights of many elements were multiples of hydrogen's atomic weight, which is in fact true for all of them if one takes isotopes into account. In 1898, J. J. Thomson found that the positive charge of a hydrogen ion is equal to the negative charge of an electron, and these were then the smallest known charged particles. Thomson later found that the positive charge in an atom is a positive multiple of an electron's negative charge. In 1913, Henry Moseley discovered that the frequencies of X-ray emissions from an excited atom were a mathematical function of its atomic number and hydrogen's nuclear charge. In 1919, Rutherford bombarded nitrogen gas with alpha particles and detected hydrogen ions being emitted from the gas, and concluded that they were produced by alpha particles hitting and splitting the nuclei of the nitrogen atoms. These observations led Rutherford to conclude that the hydrogen nucleus is a singular particle with a positive charge equal to the electron's negative charge. He named this particle ""proton"" in 1920. The number of protons in an atom (which Rutherford called the ""atomic number"") was found to be equal to the element's ordinal number on the periodic table and therefore provided a simple and clear-cut way of distinguishing the elements from each other. The atomic weight of each element is higher than its proton number, so Rutherford hypothesized that the surplus weight was carried by unknown particles with no electric charge and a mass equal to that of the proton. In 1928, Walter Bothe observed that beryllium emitted a highly penetrating, electrically neutral radiation when bombarded with alpha particles. It was later discovered that this radiation could knock hydrogen atoms out of paraffin wax. Initially it was thought to be high-energy gamma radiation, since gamma radiation had a similar effect on electrons in metals, but James Chadwick found that the ionization effect was too strong for it to be due to electromagnetic radiation, so long as energy and momentum were conserved in the interaction. In 1932, Chadwick exposed various elements, such as hydrogen and nitrogen, to the mysterious ""beryllium radiation"", and by measuring the energies of the recoiling charged particles, he deduced that the radiation was actually composed of electrically neutral particles which could not be massless like the gamma ray, but instead were required to have a mass similar to that of a proton. Chadwick now claimed these particles as Rutherford's neutrons. In 1925, Werner Heisenberg published the first consistent mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics (matrix mechanics). One year earlier, Louis de Broglie had proposed that all particles behave like waves to some extent, and in 1926 Erwin Schrödinger used this idea to develop the Schrödinger equation, which describes electrons as three-dimensional waveforms rather than points in space. A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the position and momentum of a particle at a given point in time. This became known as the uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927. In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa. Thus, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described atomic orbital zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be found. This model was able to explain observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and spectral patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen. Though the word atom originally denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of various subatomic particles. The constituent particles of an atom are the electron, the proton, and the neutron. The electron is the least massive of these particles by four orders of magnitude at 9.11×10−31 kg, with a negative electrical charge and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques. It was the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured, until the discovery of neutrino mass. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an ion. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson; see history of subatomic physics for details. Protons have a positive charge and a mass of 1.6726×10−27 kg. The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number. Ernest Rutherford (1919) observed that nitrogen under alpha-particle bombardment ejects what appeared to be hydrogen nuclei. By 1920 he had accepted that the hydrogen nucleus is a distinct particle within the atom and named it proton. Neutrons have no electrical charge and have a mass of 1.6749×10−27 kg. Neutrons are the heaviest of the three constituent particles, but their mass can be reduced by the nuclear binding energy. Neutrons and protons (collectively known as nucleons) have comparable dimensions—on the order of 2.5×10−15 m—although the 'surface' of these particles is not sharply defined. The neutron was discovered in 1932 by the English physicist James Chadwick. In the Standard Model of physics, electrons are truly elementary particles with no internal structure, whereas protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks. There are two types of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two up quarks (each with charge +⁠2/3⁠) and one down quark (with a charge of −⁠1/3⁠). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles. The quarks are held together by the strong interaction (or strong force), which is mediated by gluons. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held to each other in the nucleus by the nuclear force, which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces. All the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07 A 3 {\displaystyle 1.07{\sqrt[{3}]{A}}} femtometres, where A {\displaystyle A} is the total number of nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105 fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other. Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, called the atomic number. Within a single element, the number of neutrons may vary, determining the isotope of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons determine the nuclide. The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing radioactive decay. The proton, the electron, and the neutron are classified as fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time. Thus, every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons, and the same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud. A nucleus that has a different number of protons than neutrons can potentially drop to a lower energy state through a radioactive decay that causes the number of protons and neutrons to more closely match. As a result, atoms with matching numbers of protons and neutrons are more stable against decay, but with increasing atomic number, the mutual repulsion of the protons requires an increasing proportion of neutrons to maintain the stability of the nucleus. The number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies because of the strong force. Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, at the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3 to 10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse together into a single nucleus. Nuclear fission is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element. If the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic energy of a beta particle), as described by Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula, E = mc2, where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate. The fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an exothermic process that releases more energy than is required to bring them together. It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon begins to decrease. That means that a fusion process producing a nucleus that has an atomic number higher than about 26, and a mass number higher than about 60, is an endothermic process. Thus, more massive nuclei cannot undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star. The electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. This force binds the electrons inside an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations. Electrons, like other particles, have properties of both a particle and a wave. The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional standing wave—a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus. This behavior is defined by an atomic orbital, a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position is measured. Only a discrete (or quantized) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form. Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures, and differ from each other in size, shape and orientation. Each atomic orbital corresponds to a particular energy level of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines. The amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron—the electron binding energy—is far less than the binding energy of nucleons. For example, it requires only 13.6 eV to strip a ground-state electron from a hydrogen atom, compared to 2.23 million eV for splitting a deuterium nucleus. Atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals. By definition, any two atoms with an identical number of protons in their nuclei belong to the same chemical element. Atoms with equal numbers of protons but a different number of neutrons are different isotopes of the same element. For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but isotopes exist with no neutrons (hydrogen-1, by far the most common form, also called protium), one neutron (deuterium), two neutrons (tritium) and more than two neutrons. The known elements form a set of atomic numbers, from the single-proton element hydrogen up to the 118-proton element oganesson. All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive, although the radioactivity of element 83 (bismuth) is so slight as to be practically negligible. About 339 nuclides occur naturally on Earth, of which 251 (about 74%) have not been observed to decay, and are referred to as ""stable isotopes"". Only 90 nuclides are stable theoretically, while another 161 (bringing the total to 251) have not been observed to decay, even though in theory it is energetically possible. These are also formally classified as ""stable"". An additional 35 radioactive nuclides have half-lives longer than 100 million years, and are long-lived enough to have been present since the birth of the Solar System. This collection of 286 nuclides are known as primordial nuclides. Finally, an additional 53 short-lived nuclides are known to occur naturally, as daughter products of primordial nuclide decay (such as radium from uranium), or as products of natural energetic processes on Earth, such as cosmic ray bombardment (for example, carbon-14).[note 1] For 80 of the chemical elements, at least one stable isotope exists. As a rule, there is only a handful of stable isotopes for each of these elements, the average being 3.1 stable isotopes per element. Twenty-six ""monoisotopic elements"" have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element tin. Elements 43, 61, and all elements numbered 83 or higher have no stable isotopes.: 1–12 Stability of isotopes is affected by the ratio of protons to neutrons, and also by the presence of certain ""magic numbers"" of neutrons or protons that represent closed and filled quantum shells. These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the shell model of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide. Of the 251 known stable nuclides, only four have both an odd number of protons and odd number of neutrons: hydrogen-2 (deuterium), lithium-6, boron-10, and nitrogen-14. (Tantalum-180m is odd-odd and observationally stable, but is predicted to decay with a very long half-life.) Also, only four naturally occurring, radioactive odd-odd nuclides have a half-life over a billion years: potassium-40, vanadium-50, lanthanum-138, and lutetium-176. Most odd-odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay, because the decay products are even-even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects. The large majority of an atom's mass comes from the protons and neutrons that make it up. The total number of these particles (called ""nucleons"") in a given atom is called the mass number. It is a positive integer and dimensionless (instead of having dimension of mass), because it expresses a count. An example of use of a mass number is ""carbon-12,"" which has 12 nucleons (six protons and six neutrons). The actual mass of an atom at rest is often expressed in daltons (Da), also called the unified atomic mass unit (u). This unit is defined as a twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of carbon-12, which is approximately 1.66×10−27 kg. Hydrogen-1 (the lightest isotope of hydrogen which is also the nuclide with the lowest mass) has an atomic weight of 1.007825 Da. The value of this number is called the atomic mass. A given atom has an atomic mass approximately equal (within 1%) to its mass number times the atomic mass unit (for example the mass of a nitrogen-14 is roughly 14 Da), but this number will not be exactly an integer except (by definition) in the case of carbon-12. The heaviest stable atom is lead-208, with a mass of 207.9766521 Da. As even the most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly, chemists instead use the unit of moles. One mole of atoms of any element always has the same number of atoms (about 6.022×1023). This number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1 u, a mole of atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram. Because of the definition of the unified atomic mass unit, each carbon-12 atom has an atomic mass of exactly 12 Da, and so a mole of carbon-12 atoms weighs exactly 0.012 kg. Atoms lack a well-defined outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually described in terms of an atomic radius. This is a measure of the distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus. This assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a chemical bond. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin. On the periodic table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right). Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32 pm, while one of the largest is caesium at 225 pm. When subjected to external forces, like electrical fields, the shape of an atom may deviate from spherical symmetry. The deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons, as shown by group-theoretical considerations. Aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in crystals, where large crystal-electrical fields may occur at low-symmetry lattice sites. Significant ellipsoidal deformations have been shown to occur for sulfur ions and chalcogen ions in pyrite-type compounds. Atomic dimensions are thousands of times smaller than the wavelengths of light (400–700 nm) so they cannot be viewed using an optical microscope, although individual atoms can be observed using a scanning tunneling microscope. To visualize the minuteness of the atom, consider that a typical human hair is about 1 million carbon atoms in width. A single drop of water contains about 2 sextillion (2×1021) atoms of oxygen, and twice the number of hydrogen atoms. A single carat diamond with a mass of 2×10−4 kg contains about 10 sextillion (1022) atoms of carbon.[note 2] If an apple were magnified to the size of the Earth, then the atoms in the apple would be approximately the size of the original apple. Every element has one or more isotopes that have unstable nuclei that are subject to radioactive decay, causing the nucleus to emit particles or electromagnetic radiation. Radioactivity can occur when the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force, which only acts over distances on the order of 1 fm. The most common forms of radioactive decay are: Other more rare types of radioactive decay include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of nucleons from a nucleus, or more than one beta particle. An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is internal conversion—a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous nuclear fission. Each radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth. Elementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known as spin. This is analogous to the angular momentum of an object that is spinning around its center of mass, although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating. Spin is measured in units of the reduced Planck constant (ħ), with electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin 1⁄2 ħ, or ""spin-1⁄2"". In an atom, electrons in motion around the nucleus possess orbital angular momentum in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin. The magnetic field produced by an atom—its magnetic moment—is determined by these various forms of angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a magnetic field, but the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due to the nature of electrons to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons. In ferromagnetic elements such as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individ",Wiki
Atrophy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy,"Atrophy is the partial or complete wasting away of a part of the body. Causes of atrophy include mutations (which can destroy the gene to build up the organ), poor nourishment, poor circulation, loss of hormonal support, loss of nerve supply to the target organ, excessive amount of apoptosis of cells, and disuse or lack of exercise or disease intrinsic to the tissue itself. In medical practice, hormonal and nerve inputs that maintain an organ or body part are said to have trophic effects. A diminished muscular trophic condition is designated as atrophy. Atrophy is reduction in size of cell, organ or tissue, after attaining its normal mature growth. In contrast, hypoplasia is the reduction in the cellular numbers of an organ, or tissue that has not attained normal maturity. Atrophy is the general physiological process of reabsorption and breakdown of tissues, involving apoptosis. When it occurs as a result of disease or loss of trophic support because of other diseases, it is termed pathological atrophy, although it can be a part of normal body development and homeostasis as well. Examples of atrophy as part of normal development include shrinking and the involution of the thymus in early childhood, and the tonsils in adolescence. In old age, effects include, but are not limited to, loss of teeth, hair, thinning of skin that creates wrinkles, weakening of muscles, loss of weight in organs and sluggish mental activity. Disuse atrophy of muscles and bones, with loss of mass and strength, can occur after prolonged immobility, such as extended bedrest, or having a body part in a cast (living in darkness for the eye, bedridden for the legs etc.). This type of atrophy can usually be reversed with exercise unless severe. There are many diseases and conditions which cause atrophy of muscle mass. For example, diseases such as cancer and AIDS induce a body wasting syndrome called cachexia, which is notable for the severe muscle atrophy seen. Other syndromes or conditions which can induce skeletal muscle atrophy are congestive heart failure and liver disease. During aging, there is a gradual decrease in the ability to maintain skeletal muscle function and mass. This condition is called sarcopenia, and may be distinct from atrophy in its pathophysiology. While the exact cause of sarcopenia is unknown, it may be induced by a combination of a gradual failure in the satellite cells which help to regenerate skeletal muscle fibers, and a decrease in sensitivity to or the availability of critical secreted growth factors which are necessary to maintain muscle mass and satellite cell survival. Pathologic atrophy of muscles can occur with diseases of the motor nerves or diseases of the muscle tissue itself. Examples of atrophying nerve diseases include Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, poliomyelitis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease), and Guillain–Barré syndrome. Examples of atrophying muscle diseases include muscular dystrophy, myotonia congenita, and myotonic dystrophy. Changes in Na+ channel isoform expression and spontaneous activity in muscle called fibrillation can also result in muscle atrophy. A flail limb is a medical term which refers to an extremity in which the primary nerve has been severed, resulting in complete lack of mobility and sensation. The muscles soon wither away from atrophy. The adrenal glands atrophy during prolonged use of exogenous glucocorticoids like prednisone. Atrophy of the breasts can occur with prolonged estrogen reduction, as with anorexia nervosa or menopause. Testicular atrophy can occur with prolonged use of enough exogenous sex steroids (either androgen or estrogen) to reduce gonadotropin secretion. In post-menopausal women, the walls of the vagina become thinner (atrophic vaginitis). The mechanism for the age-related condition is not yet clear, though there are theories that the effect is caused by decreases in estrogen levels. This atrophy, occurring concurrently with breast atrophy, is consistent with the homeostatic (normal development) role of atrophy in general, as after menopause the body has no further functional biological need to maintain the reproductive system which it has permanently shut down. One drug in test seemed to prevent the type of muscle loss that occurs in immobile, bedridden patients. Testing on mice showed that it blocked the activity of a protein present in the muscle that is involved in muscle atrophy. However, the drug's long-term effect on the heart precludes its routine use in humans, and other drugs are being sought.",Wiki
Automated_analyser,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_analyser,"An automated analyser is a medical laboratory instrument designed to measure various substances and other characteristics in a number of biological samples quickly, with minimal human assistance. These measured properties of blood and other fluids may be useful in the diagnosis of disease. Photometry is the most common method for testing the amount of a specific analyte in a sample. In this technique, the sample undergoes a reaction to produce a color change. Then, a photometer measures the absorbance of the sample to indirectly measure the concentration of analyte present in the sample. The use of an ion-selective electrode (ISE) is another common analytical method that specifically measures ion concentrations. This typically measures the concentrations of sodium, calcium or potassium present in the sample. There are various methods of introducing samples into the analyser. Test tubes of samples are often loaded into racks. These racks can be inserted directly into some analysers or, in larger labs, moved along an automated track. More manual methods include inserting tubes directly into circular carousels that rotate to make the sample available. Some analysers require samples to be transferred to sample cups. However, the need to protect the health and safety of laboratory staff has prompted many manufacturers to develop analysers that feature closed tube sampling, preventing workers from direct exposure to samples. Samples can be processed singly, in batches, or continuously. The automation of laboratory testing does not remove the need for human expertise (results must still be evaluated by medical technologists and other qualified clinical laboratory professionals), but it does ease concerns about error reduction, staffing concerns, and safety. These are machines that process a large portion of the samples going into a hospital or private medical laboratory. Automation of the testing process has reduced testing time for many analytes from days to minutes. The history of discrete sample analysis for the clinical laboratory began with the introduction of the ""Robot Chemist"" invented by Hans Baruch and introduced commercially in 1959. The AutoAnalyzer is an early example of an automated chemistry analyzer using a special flow technique named ""continuous flow analysis (CFA)"", invented in 1957 by Leonard Skeggs, PhD and first made by the Technicon Corporation. The first applications were for clinical (medical) analysis. The AutoAnalyzer profoundly changed the character of the chemical testing laboratory by allowing significant increases in the numbers of samples that could be processed. Samples used in the analyzers include, but are not limited to, blood, serum, plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and other fluids from within the body. The design based on separating a continuously flowing stream with air bubbles largely reduced slow, clumsy, and error-prone manual methods of analysis. The types of tests include enzyme levels (such as many of the liver function tests), ion levels (e.g. sodium and potassium, and other tell-tale chemicals (such as glucose, serum albumin, or creatinine). Simple ions are often measured with ion selective electrodes, which let one type of ion through, and measure voltage differences. Enzymes may be measured by the rate they change one coloured substance to another; in these tests, the results for enzymes are given as an activity, not as a concentration of the enzyme. Other tests use colorimetric changes to determine the concentration of the chemical in question. Turbidity may also be measured. Antibodies are used by some analysers to detect many substances by immunoassay and other reactions that employ the use of antibody-antigen reactions. When concentration of these compounds is too low to cause a measurable increase in turbidity when bound to antibody, more specialised methods must be used. Recent developments include automation for the immunohaematology lab, also known as transfusion medicine. These are used to perform complete blood counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs), or coagulation tests. Automated cell counters sample the blood, and quantify, classify, and describe cell populations using both electrical and optical techniques. Electrical analysis involves passing a dilute solution of the blood through an aperture across which an electrical current is flowing. The passage of cells through the current changes the impedance between the terminals (the Coulter principle). A lytic reagent is added to the blood solution to selectively lyse the red cells (RBCs), leaving only white cells (WBCs), and platelets intact. Then the solution is passed through a second detector. This allows the counts of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets to be obtained. The platelet count is easily separated from the WBC count by the smaller impedance spikes they produce in the detector due to their lower cell volumes. Optical detection may be utilised to gain a differential count of the populations of white cell types. A dilute suspension of cells is passed through a flow cell, which passes cells one at a time through a capillary tube past a laser beam. The reflectance, transmission and scattering of light from each cell is analysed by sophisticated software giving a numerical representation of the likely overall distribution of cell populations. Some of the latest hematology instruments may report Cell Population Data that consist in Leukocyte morphological information that may be used for flagging Cell abnormalities that trigger the suspect of some diseases. Reticulocyte counts can now be performed by many analysers, giving an alternative to time-consuming manual counts. Many automated reticulocyte counts, like their manual counterparts, employ the use of a supravital dye such as new methylene blue to stain the red cells containing reticulin prior to counting. Some analysers have a modular slide maker which is able to both produce a blood film of consistent quality and stain the film, which is then reviewed by a medical laboratory professional. Automated coagulation machines or Coagulometers measure the ability of blood to clot by performing any of several types of tests including Partial thromboplastin times, Prothrombin times (and the calculated INRs commonly used for therapeutic evaluation), Lupus anticoagulant screens, D dimer assays, and factor assays. Coagulometers require blood samples that have been drawn in tubes containing sodium citrate as an anticoagulant. These are used because the mechanism behind the anticoagulant effect of sodium citrate is reversible. Depending on the test, different substances can be added to the blood plasma to trigger a clotting reaction. The progress of clotting may be monitored optically by measuring the absorbance of a particular wavelength of light by the sample and how it changes over time. ..

Autopsy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy,"An autopsy (also referred to as post-mortem examination, obduction, necropsy,[Note 1] or autopsia cadaverum) is a surgical procedure that consists of a thorough examination of a corpse by dissection to determine the cause, mode, and manner of death; or the exam may be performed to evaluate any disease or injury that may be present for research or educational purposes. The term necropsy is generally used for non-human animals. Autopsies are usually performed by a specialized medical doctor called a pathologist. Only a small portion of deaths require an autopsy to be performed, under certain circumstances. In most cases, a medical examiner or coroner can determine the cause of death. Autopsies are performed for either legal or medical purposes. Autopsies can be performed when any of the following information is desired: For example, a forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where an external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from next of kin may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete, the body is reconstituted by sewing it back together. The term ""autopsy"" derives from the Ancient Greek αὐτοψία autopsia, ""to see for oneself"", derived from αὐτός (autos, ""oneself"") and ὄψις (opsis, ""sight, view""). The word has been in use since around the 17th century. The term ""post-mortem"" derives from the Latin post, 'after', and mortem, 'death'. It was first recorded in 1734. The term ""necropsy"" is derived from the Greek νεκρός 'death' and ὄψις (opsis, 'sight, view'). The principal aims of an autopsy are to determine the cause of death, mode of death, manner of death, the state of health of the person before he or she died, and whether any medical diagnosis and treatment before death were appropriate. In most Western countries the number of autopsies performed in hospitals has been decreasing every year since 1955. Critics, including pathologist and former JAMA editor George D. Lundberg, have charged that the reduction in autopsies is negatively affecting the care delivered in hospitals, because when mistakes result in death, they are often not investigated and lessons, therefore, remain unlearned. When a person has permitted an autopsy in advance of their death, autopsies may also be carried out for the purposes of teaching or medical research. An autopsy is usually performed in cases of sudden death, where a doctor is not able to write a death certificate, or when death is believed to result from an unnatural cause. These examinations are performed under a legal authority (medical examiner, coroner, or procurator fiscal) and do not require the consent of relatives of the deceased. The most extreme example is the examination of murder victims, especially when medical examiners are looking for signs of death or the murder method, such as bullet wounds and exit points, signs of strangulation, or traces of poison. Some religions including Judaism and Islam usually discourage the performing of autopsies on their adherents. Organizations such as ZAKA in Israel and Misaskim in the United States generally guide families on how to ensure that an unnecessary autopsy is not made. Autopsies are used in clinical medicine to identify a medical error or a previously unnoticed condition that may endanger the living, such as infectious diseases or exposure to hazardous materials. A study that focused on myocardial infarction (heart attack) as a cause of death found significant errors of omission and commission, i.e. a sizable number of cases ascribed to myocardial infarctions (MIs) were not MIs and a significant number of non-MIs were MIs. A systematic review of studies of the autopsy calculated that in about 25% of autopsies, a major diagnostic error will be revealed. However, this rate has decreased over time and the study projects that in a contemporary US institution, 8.4% to 24.4% of autopsies will detect major diagnostic errors. A large meta-analysis suggested that approximately one-third of death certificates are incorrect and that half of the autopsies performed produced findings that were not suspected before the person died. Also, it is thought that over one-fifth of unexpected findings can only be diagnosed histologically, i.e., by biopsy or autopsy, and that approximately one-quarter of unexpected findings, or 5% of all findings, are major and can similarly only be diagnosed from tissue. One study found that (out of 694 diagnoses) ""Autopsies revealed 171 missed diagnoses, including 21 cancers, 12 strokes, 11 myocardial infarctions, 10 pulmonary emboli, and 9 endocarditis, among others"". Focusing on intubated patients, one study found ""abdominal pathologic conditions – abscesses, bowel perforations, or infarction – were as frequent as pulmonary emboli as a cause of class I errors. While patients with abdominal pathologic conditions generally complained of abdominal pain, results of an examination of the abdomen were considered unremarkable in most patients, and the symptom was not pursued"". There are four main types of autopsy: A forensic autopsy is used to determine the cause, mode, and manner of death. Forensic science involves the application of the sciences to answer questions of interest to the legal system. Medical examiners attempt to determine the time of death, the exact cause of death, and what, if anything, preceded the death, such as a struggle. A forensic autopsy may include obtaining biological specimens from the deceased for toxicological testing, including stomach contents. Toxicology tests may reveal the presence of one or more chemical ""poisons"" (all chemicals, in sufficient quantities, can be classified as a poison) and their quantity. Because post-mortem deterioration of the body, together with the gravitational pooling of bodily fluids, will necessarily alter the bodily environment, toxicology tests may overestimate, rather than underestimate, the quantity of the suspected chemical. Following an in-depth examination of all the evidence, a medical examiner or coroner will assign a manner of death from the choices proscribed by the fact-finder's jurisdiction and will detail the evidence on the mechanism of the death. Clinical autopsies serve two major purposes. They are performed to gain more insight into pathological processes and determine what factors contributed to a patient's death. For example, material for infectious disease testing can be collected during an autopsy. Autopsies are also performed to ensure the standard of care at hospitals. Autopsies can yield insight into how patient deaths can be prevented in the future. Within the United Kingdom, clinical autopsies can be carried out only with the consent of the family of the deceased person, as opposed to a medico-legal autopsy instructed by a Coroner (England & Wales) or Procurator Fiscal (Scotland), to which the family cannot object. Over time, autopsies have not only been able to determine the cause of death, but have also led to discoveries of various diseases such as fetal alcohol syndrome, Legionnaire's disease, and even viral hepatitis. Academic autopsies are performed by students of anatomy for the purpose of study, giving medical students and residents firsthand experience viewing anatomy and pathology. Postmortem examinations require the skill to connect anatomic and clinical pathology together since they involve organ systems and interruptions from ante-mortem and post-mortem. These academic autopsies allow for students to practice and develop skills in pathology and become meticulous in later case examinations. Virtual autopsies are performed using radiographic techniques which can be used in post-mortem examinations for a deceased individual. It is an alternative to medical autopsies, where radiographs are used, for example, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Computed tomography (CT scan) which produce radiographic images in order to determine the cause of death, the nature, and the manner of death, without dissecting the deceased. It can also be used in the identification of the deceased. This method is helpful in determining the questions pertaining to an autopsy without putting the examiner at risk of biohazardous materials that can be in an individual's body. In 2004 in England and Wales, there were 514,000 deaths, of which 225,500 were referred to the coroner. Of those, 115,800 (22.5% of all deaths) resulted in post-mortem examinations and there were 28,300 inquests, 570 with a jury. The rate of consented (hospital) autopsy in the UK and worldwide has declined rapidly over the past 50 years. In the UK in 2013, only 0.7% of inpatient adult deaths were followed by consented autopsy. The autopsy rate in Germany is below 5% and thus much lower than in other countries in Europe. The governmental reimbursement is hardly sufficient to cover all the costs, so the medical journal Deutsches Ärzteblatt, issued by the German Medical Association, makes the effort to raise awareness regarding the underfinancing of autopsies. The same sources stated that autopsy rates in Sweden and Finland reach 20 to 30%. In the United States, autopsy rates fell from 17% in 1980 to 14% in 1985 and 11.5% in 1989, although the figures vary notably from county to county. The body is received at a medical examiner's office, municipal mortuary, or hospital in a body bag or evidence sheet. A new body bag is used for each body to ensure that only evidence from that body is contained within the bag. Evidence sheets are an alternative way to transport the body. An evidence sheet is a sterile sheet that covers the body when it is moved. If it is believed there may be any significant evidence on the hands, for example, gunshot residue or skin under the fingernails, a separate paper sack is put around each hand and taped shut around the wrist. There are two parts to the physical examination of the body: the external and internal examination. Toxicology, biochemical tests or genetic testing/molecular autopsy often supplement these and frequently assist the pathologist in assigning the cause or causes of death. At many institutions, the person responsible for handling, cleaning, and moving the body is called a diener, the German word for servant. In the UK this role is performed by an Anatomical Pathology Technician (APT), who will also assist the pathologist in eviscerating the body and reconstruction after the autopsy. After the body is received, it is first photographed. The examiner then notes the kind of clothes – if any – and their position on the body before they are removed. Next, any evidence such as residue, flakes of paint, or other material is collected from the external surfaces of the body. Ultraviolet light may also be used to search body surfaces for any evidence not easily visible to the naked eye. Samples of hair, nails, and the like are taken, and the body may also be radiographically imaged. Once the external evidence is collected, the body is removed from the bag, undressed, and any wounds present are examined. The body is then cleaned, weighed, and measured in preparation for the internal examination. A general description of the body as regards ethnic group, sex, age, hair colour and length, eye colour, and other distinguishing features (birthmarks, old scar tissue, moles, tattoos, etc.) is then made. A voice recorder or a standard examination form is normally used to record this information. In some countries, e.g., Scotland, France, Germany, Russia, and Canada, an autopsy may comprise an external examination only. This concept is sometimes termed a ""view and grant"". The principle behind this is that the medical records, history of the deceased and circumstances of death have all indicated as to the cause and manner of death without the need for an internal examination. If not already in place, a plastic or rubber brick called a ""head block"" is placed under the shoulders of the corpse; hyperflexion of the neck makes the spine arch backward while stretching and pushing the chest upward to make it easier to incise. This gives the APT, or pathologist, maximum exposure to the trunk. After this is done, the internal examination begins. The internal examination consists of inspecting the internal organs of the body by dissection for evidence of trauma or other indications of the cause of death. For the internal examination there are a number of different approaches available: There is no need for any incision to be made, which will be visible after completion of the examination when the deceased is dressed in a shroud. In all of the above cases, the incision then extends all the way down to the pubic bone (making a deviation to either side of the navel) and avoiding, where possible, transecting any scars that may be present. Bleeding from the cuts is minimal, or non-existent because the pull of gravity is producing the only blood pressure at this point, related directly to the complete lack of cardiac functionality. However, in certain cases, there is anecdotal evidence that bleeding can be quite profuse, especially in cases of drowning. At this point, shears are used to open the chest cavity. The examiner uses the tool to cut through the ribs on the costal cartilage, to allow the sternum to be removed; this is done so that the heart and lungs can be seen in situ and that the heart – in particular, the pericardial sac – is not damaged or disturbed from opening. A PM 40 knife is used to remove the sternum from the soft tissue that attaches it to the mediastinum. Now the lungs and the heart are exposed. The sternum is set aside and will eventually be replaced at the end of the autopsy. At this stage, the organs are exposed. Usually, the organs are removed in a systematic fashion. Making a decision as to what order the organs are to be removed will depend highly on the case in question. Organs can be removed in several ways: The first is the en masse technique of Letulle whereby all the organs are removed as one large mass. The second is the en bloc method of Ghon. The most popular in the UK is a modified version of this method, which is divided into four groups of organs. Although these are the two predominant evisceration techniques, in the UK variations on these are widespread. One method is described here: The pericardial sac is opened to view the heart. Blood for chemical analysis may be removed from the inferior vena cava or the pulmonary veins. Before removing the heart, the pulmonary artery is opened in order to search for a blood clot. The heart can then be removed by cutting the inferior vena cava, the pulmonary veins, the aorta and pulmonary artery, and the superior vena cava. This method leaves the aortic arch intact, which will make things easier for the embalmer. The left lung is then easily accessible and can be removed by cutting the bronchus, artery, and vein at the hilum. The right lung can then be similarly removed. The abdominal organs can be removed one by one after first examining their relationships and vessels. Most pathologists, however, prefer the organs to be removed all in one ""block"". Using dissection of the fascia, blunt dissection; using the fingers or hands and traction; the organs are dissected out in one piece for further inspection and sampling. During autopsies of infants, this method is used almost all of the time. The various organs are examined, weighed and tissue samples in the form of slices are taken. Even major blood vessels are cut open and inspected at this stage. Next, the stomach and intestinal contents are examined and weighed. This could be useful to find the cause and time of death, due to the natural passage of food through the bowel during digestion. The more area empty, the longer the deceased had gone without a meal before death. The body block that was used earlier to elevate the chest cavity is now used to elevate the head. To examine the brain, an incision is made from behind one ear, over the crown of the head, to a point behind the other ear. When the autopsy is completed, the incision can be neatly sewn up and is not noticed when the head is resting on a pillow in an open casket funeral. The scalp is pulled away from the skull in two flaps with the front flap going over the face and the rear flap over the back of the neck. The skull is then cut with a circular (or semicircular) bladed reciprocating saw to create a ""cap"" that can be pulled off, exposing the brain. The brain is then observed in situ. Then the brain's connections to the cranial nerves and spinal cord are severed, and the brain is lifted out of the skull for further examination. If the brain needs to be preserved before being inspected, it is contained in a large container of formalin (15 percent solution of formaldehyde gas in buffered water) for at least two, but preferably four weeks. This not only preserves the brain, but also makes it firmer, allowing easier handling without corrupting the tissue. An important component of the autopsy is the reconstitution of the body such that it can be viewed, if desired, by relatives of the deceased following the procedure. After the examination, the body has an open and empty thoracic cavity with chest flaps open on both sides; the top of the skull is missing, and the skull flaps are pulled over the face and neck. It is unusual to examine the face, arms, hands or legs internally. In the UK, following the Human Tissue Act 2004 all organs and tissue must be returned to the body unless permission is given by the family to retain any tissue for further investigation. Normally the internal body cavity is lined with cotton, wool, or a similar material, and the organs are then placed into a plastic bag to prevent leakage and are returned to the body cavity. The chest flaps are then closed and sewn back together and the skull cap is sewed back in place. Then the body may be wrapped in a shroud, and it is common for relatives to not be able to tell the procedure has been done when the body is viewed in a funeral parlor after embalming. An autopsy of stroke may be able to establish the time taken from the onset of cerebral infarction to the time of death. Various microscopic findings are present at times from infarction as follows: Around 3000 BCE, ancient Egyptians were one of the first civilizations to practice the removal and examination of the internal organs of humans in the religious practice of mummification. Autopsies that opened the body to determine the cause of death were attested at least in the early third millennium BCE, although they were opposed in many ancient societies where it was believed that the outward disfigurement of dead persons prevented them from entering the afterlife (as with the Egyptians, who removed the organs through tiny slits in the body). Notable Greek autopsists were Erasistratus and Herophilus of Chalcedon, who lived in 3rd century BCE Alexandria, but in general, autopsies were rare in ancient Greece. In 44 BCE, Julius Caesar was the subject of an official autopsy after his murder by rival senators, the physician's report noting that the second stab wound Caesar received was the fatal one. Julius Caesar had been stabbed a total of 23 times. By around 150 BCE, ancient Roman legal practice had established clear parameters for autopsies. The greatest ancient anatomist was Galen (CE 129– c. 216), whose findings would not be challenged until the Renaissance over a thousand years later. Ibn Tufail has elaborated on autopsy in his treatise called Hayy ibn Yaqzan and Nadia Maftouni, discussing the subject in an extensive article, believes him to be among the early supporters of autopsy and vivisection. The dissection of human remains for medical or scientific reasons continued to be practiced irregularly after the Romans, for instance by the Arab physicians Avenzoar and Ibn al-Nafis. In Europe they were done with enough regularity to become skilled, as early as 1200, and successful efforts to preserve the body, by filling the veins with wax and metals. Until the 20th century, it was thought that the modern autopsy process derived from the anatomists of the Renaissance. Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682–1771), celebrated as the father of anatomical pathology, wrote the first exhaustive work on pathology, De Sedibus et Causis Morborum per Anatomen Indagatis (The Seats and Causes of Diseases Investigated by Anatomy, 1769). In 1543, Andreas Vesalius conducted a public dissection of the body of a former criminal. He asserted and articulated the bones, this became the world's oldest surviving anatomical preparation. It is still displayed at the Anatomical Museum at the University of Basel. In the mid-1800s, Carl von Rokitansky and colleagues at the Second Vienna Medical School began to undertake dissections as a means to improve diagnostic medicine. The 19th-century medical researcher Rudolf Virchow, in response to a lack of standardization of autopsy procedures, established and published specific autopsy protocols (one such protocol still bears his name). He also developed the concept of pathological processes. During the turn of the 20th century, the Scotland Yard created the Office of the Forensic Pathologist, a medical examiner trained in medicine, charged with investigating the cause of all unnatural deaths, including accidents, homicides, suicides, etc. A post-mortem examination, or necropsy, is far more common in veterinary medicine than in human medicine. For many species that exhibit few external symptoms (sheep), or that are not suited to detailed clinical examination (poultry, cage birds, zoo animals), it is a common method used by veterinary physicians to come to a diagnosis. A necropsy is mostly used like an autopsy to determine the cause of death. The entire body is examined at the gross visual level, and samples are collected for additional analyses.",Wiki
Aviation_medicine,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_medicine,"Aviation medicine, also called flight medicine or aerospace medicine, is a preventive or occupational medicine in which the patients/subjects are pilots, aircrews, or astronauts. The specialty strives to treat or prevent conditions to which aircrews are particularly susceptible, applies medical knowledge to the human factors in aviation and is thus a critical component of aviation safety. A military practitioner of aviation medicine may be called a flight surgeon and a civilian practitioner is an aviation medical examiner. One of the biggest differences between the military and civilian flight doctors is the military flight surgeon's requirement to log flight hours. Broadly defined, this subdiscipline endeavors to discover and prevent various adverse physiological responses to hostile biologic and physical stresses encountered in the aerospace environment. Problems range from life support measures for astronauts to recognizing an ear block in an infant traveling on an airliner with elevated cabin pressure altitude. Aeromedical certification of pilots, aircrew and patients is also part of aviation medicine. A final subdivision is the AeroMedical Transportation Specialty. These military and civilian specialists are concerned with protecting aircrew and patients who are transported by AirEvac aircraft (helicopters or fixed-wing airplanes). Atmospheric physics potentially affect all air travelers regardless of the aircraft. As humans ascend through the first 9100–12,300 m (30,000–40,000 ft), temperature decreases linearly at an average rate of 2 °C (3.6 °F) per 305 m (1000 ft). If sea-level temperature is 16 °C (60 °F), the outside air temperature is approximately −57 °C (−70 °F) at 10,700 m (35,000 ft). Pressure and humidity also decline, and aircrew are exposed to radiation, vibration and acceleration forces (the latter are also known as ""g"" forces). Aircraft life support systems such as oxygen, heat and pressurization are the first line of defense against most of the hostile aerospace environment. Higher performance aircraft provide more sophisticated life support equipment, such as ""G-suits"" to help the body resist the adverse effects of acceleration, along with pressure breathing apparatus, or ejection seats or other escape equipment. Every factor contributing to a safe flight has a failure rate. The crew of an aircraft is no different. Aviation medicine aims to keep this rate in the humans involved equal to or below a specified risk level. This standard of risk is also applied to airframe, avionics and systems associated with flights. AeroMedical examinations aim at screening for elevation in risk of sudden incapacitation, such as a tendency towards myocardial infarction (heart attacks), epilepsy or the presence of metabolic conditions diabetes, etc. which may lead to hazardous condition at altitude. The goal of the AeroMedical Examination is to protect the life and health of pilots and passengers by making reasonable medical assurance that an individual is fit to fly. Other screened conditions such as colour blindness can prevent a person from flying because of an inability to perform a function that is necessary. In this case to tell green from red. These specialized medical exams consist of physical examinations performed by an Aviation Medical Examiner or a military Flight Surgeon, doctors trained to screen potential aircrew for identifiable medical conditions that could lead to problems while performing airborne duties. In addition, this unique population of aircrews is a high-risk group for several diseases and harmful conditions due to irregular work shifts with irregular sleeping and irregular meals (usually carbonated drinks and high energy snacks) and work-related stress.",Wiki
Bachelor_of_Medical_Sciences,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Medical_Sciences,"A Bachelor of Medical Sciences (BMedSci, BMedSc, BSc(Med), BMSc) is an undergraduate academic degree involving study of a variety of disciplines related to human health leading to an in depth understanding of human biology and associated research skills such as study design, statistics and laboratory techniques. Such disciplines include biochemistry, cell biology, physiology, pharmacology or psychosocial aspects of health. It is an equivalent level qualification to the more commonly awarded Bachelor of Science (BSc). Graduates may enter a diverse range of roles including post-graduate study, higher education, the biotechnology industry, the pharmaceutical industry, consultancy roles, scientific communication, education or unrelated disciplines which make use of the broad range of transferable skills gained through this degree. In Australia, the Bachelor of Medical Sciences (BMedSc) degree is offered by The University of Adelaide, Griffith University, University of New South Wales, University of Sydney, Monash University, Australian National University, University of Western Sydney, University of Newcastle, Flinders University, Charles Sturt University, Macquarie University , Central Queensland University and The University of the Sunshine Coast. At the University of Western Ontario, BMSc is a four-year degree offered by the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. It is differentiated from a BSc due to the advanced medical sciences orientation of the courses offered such as Anatomy and Pharmacology. The University of Alberta offers a BMSc to Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry students who did not complete a bachelor's degree prior to entry into the program. In India, BMSc is an undergraduate degree offered by top universities like Panjab University, Punjabi University, Indian Institutes of Technology and the R. G. Kar Medical College and Hospital. In the United Kingdom, the Bachelor of Medical Sciences degree can be awarded in four situations; firstly as a standalone 3-year first degree, secondly, as a consequence of taking an extra year during a medical or dental course (termed intercalating), thirdly as an additional part of a medical degree but without any additional years of study, and fourthly as an exit award if a student wishes to leave their primary medical or dental undergraduate course. When the degree is obtained without any additional years of study, it may not be viewed as an equivalent qualification. For example, the UK Foundation Programme Office (the British body which manages first jobs for new medical graduates) places less value on a BMedSc degree if an additional year of study has not been undertaken. Regardless of the way in which the degree is obtained, a research project typically forms a large component of the degree as well as formal teaching in medical science related disciplines. Bachelor of Medical Sciences degrees are awarded as a standalone 3-year course by the University of Chester, University of Exeter, University of Birmingham, the University of Sheffield, Bangor University, Oxford Brookes University, De Montfort University, and the University of St Andrews. Medical schools which award an intercalated Bachelor of Medical Sciences after an additional year of study are Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, the University of Birmingham, the University of Dundee, the University of Edinburgh the University of Aberdeen and the University of Sheffield. The University of Nottingham and the University of Southampton award the degree as a standard part of their undergraduate medicine courses without an additional year of study (students must undertake a research project). In Egypt, the bachelor of medical sciences is awarded after four years of study in addition to an internship year in which interns are trained in multiple public and university hospitals. The degree is offered in five universities in Egypt: October 6 University, Misr University for Science and Technology, Pharos University in Alexandria, Beni-Suef University and Menoufia University. Faculties of applied medical sciences offer various disciplines for students to choose from, including medical laboratories, radiology and medical imaging, therapeutic nutrition, and biomedical equipment. In 2015, the Central Authority For Organization and Administration (CAOA) granted the holders of the bachelor of medical sciences the title of ""specialist"" in the corresponding specialty. BSc.Med is granted by all six medical schools in Israel: the Hebrew University, Tel Aviv University, Ben-Gurion University, the Technion, Bar-Ilan University and Ariel University. The full M.D. program consists of six years of studies and an additional year of internship. The first part of the program consists of three years of basic science (pre-clinical) studies, culminating in the award of a BSc.Med degree in medical sciences.",Wiki
"Bachelor_of_Medicine,_Bachelor_of_Surgery",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Medicine%2C_Bachelor_of_Surgery,"A Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (Latin: Medicinae Baccalaureus, Baccalaureus Chirurgiae; MBBS, also abbreviated as BM BS, MB ChB, MB BCh, or MB BChir) is a medical degree granted by medical schools or universities in countries that adhere to the United Kingdom's higher education tradition. Despite the historical distinction in nomenclature, these degrees are typically combined and conferred together. This degree is usually awarded as an undergraduate degree, but it can also be awarded at graduate-level medical institutions. The typical duration for completion is five to six years. Some medical institutions, primarily in Ireland, award the Bachelor of Obstetrics (Latin: Baccalaureus in Arte Obstetricia), abbreviated BAO, in addition to the MB BCh. A Bachelor of Medicine (BMed or MB) is an undergraduate medical degree awarded by medical schools in countries following the tradition of China. The completion period for this degree is generally five to six years. The term 'Medicine' in this context encompasses the broader field of medical science and practice, rather than specifically internal medicine. Consequently, graduates with a BMed degree are qualified to practise surgery. The BMed degree serves as the primary medical qualification, and individuals holding it may pursue further professional education, such as a Master of Medical Science or a Doctor of Medical Science (equivalent to a PhD). Both degrees are considered equivalent to the Doctor of Medicine degree typically conferred by universities in North America. In the United States only, some doctors opt to train in osteopathic medicine, and thus receive a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree. For practical purposes, all three degrees (MBBS/MD/DO) are considered to be equal. The degree is currently awarded in institutions in the United Kingdom and countries formerly part of the British Empire. Historically, Bachelor of Medicine was also the primary medical degree conferred by institutions in the United States and Canada, such as the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, the University of Toronto, the University of Maryland, and Columbia University. Several early North American medical schools were (for the most part) founded by physicians and surgeons who had trained in England and Scotland. University medical education in England culminated with the Bachelor of Medicine qualification and in Scotland the Doctor of Medicine. In the mid-19th century, the public bodies that regulated medical practice required practitioners in Scotland and England to hold the dual Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees. Over the course of the 19th century, North American medical schools switched to the tradition of the ancient universities of Scotland and began conferring Doctor of Medicine rather than Bachelor of Medicine. In the countries that award bachelor's degrees in medicine, however, Doctor of Medicine denotes a holder of a junior doctorate and is reserved for medical practitioners who undertake research and submit a thesis in the field of medicine. Nevertheless, those holding Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery are usually referred to by the courtesy title of ""Doctor"" and use the prefix ""Dr."", whether or not they also hold a Ph.D. or DSc. In many countries, the degrees are awarded after an undergraduate course lasting five or six years. For example, most Chinese universities offering medical degrees provide undergraduate courses lasting six years. In some cases, a graduate in another discipline may subsequently enter a special graduate-entry medical course, reduced in duration to account for relevant material covered or learning skills acquired during the first degree. In some cases the old first-year courses (for six-year degrees) in the basic sciences of physics, chemistry, and biology have been abolished: that standard has to be reached by school examinations before entry. However, in most countries, a newly graduated Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery must spend a specified period in internship before he or she can obtain full registration as a licensed medical practitioner. The names and abbreviations given to these degrees depend on the institution, awarding body or country, and vary widely. This is mostly for reasons of tradition rather than to indicate any difference between the relative levels of the degrees. They are considered equivalent. If the awarding body titles the degrees in Latin, the degrees are commonly named Medicinae Baccalaureus, Chirurgiae Baccalaureus; Medicinae Baccalaureus et Chirurgiae Baccalaureus; or Baccalaureus in Medicina et in Chirurgia; abbreviated as MB ChB, MB BCh or otherwise. If titled in English, they are named Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery; Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery; or Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery; usually abbreviated as MB BS, and sometimes as BM BS, even though most MB BS-awarding institutions do not use Latin to name their degrees. Below are described the specific names used, arranged by country. Historically, Australian medical schools have followed the British tradition by conferring the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) to its graduates whilst reserving the title of Doctor of Medicine (MD) for their research training degree, analogous to the PhD, or for their honorary doctorates. Although the majority of Australian MBBS degrees have been graduate programs since the 1990s, under the previous Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) they remained categorised as Level 7 Bachelor's degrees together with other undergraduate programs. The latest version of the AQF includes the new category of Level 9 Master's (Extended) degrees which permits the use of the term 'Doctor' in the styling of the degree title of relevant professional programs. As a result, most undregraduate Australian medical schools have replaced their MBBS degrees with a combined degree that ends with the MD (e.g. the Bachelor of Medical Studies / Doctor of Medicine at The University of New South Wales or the Bachelor of Medical Science and Doctor of Medicine at Monash University) or switched to graduate only MD pathways, to resolve the previous anomalous nomenclature. Even still, Curtin University and James Cook University both still offer the MBBS degree. With the introduction of the Master's level MD, universities have also renamed their previous medical research doctorates. The University of Melbourne was the first to introduce the MD in 2011 as a basic medical degree, and has renamed its research degree to Doctor of Medical Science (DMedSc). The Medical University of Bahrain or RCSI-Bahrain is a constituent university of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) and awards its graduates the MB, BCh, BAO (Hons), the same degree awarded to graduates at RCSI. All medical schools in Bangladesh award MBBS.[citation needed] The Bridgetown International University, Victoria University of Barbados, American University of Barbados School of Medicine, and University of the West Indies Faculty of Medicine all award the MBBS. In China, medical undergraduates are awarded a Bachelor of Medicine (MB, also BMed, and BM) in Clinical Medicine for a course of study lasting five years for native Chinese students and six years for international/foreign students, including internship. International students may take the program in English or Chinese. Some medical schools also award MBBS degrees, but only for international students. In total, 247 universities are authorized to award medical degrees. All 247 universities are recognized by most of the medical councils around the world and by ECFMG. By August 2022, 136 universities have passed the process of Accreditation of Medical Education from the Ministry of Education of China. The universities awarding MB and MBBS degrees are at the list of medical schools in China. All Egyptian medical schools, public and private, award an MB BCh as the basic medical degree after completion of five academic and clinical study years followed by two years of obligatory clinical rotations (the MB BCh is issued only after the completion of the clinical rotations) with total of seven years both academic, clinical study and clinical rotations.[citation needed] French students get permitted access to medical studies when succeeding the competitive examination occurring at the end of their first year of studies. They spend their second and third year at their medical school where they learn physiology, semiology and the basics of medical examination. From their fourth year, they begin their rotations in teaching hospitals where they assist junior and senior physicians and learn their art. At the end of their sixth year, they undertake a competitive examination to match with their medical specialty and city of practice. Students are then full-time physicians practising under supervision and will be called ""doctors"" only when graduating at the end of their residency.[citation needed] After 9 years (or 3 cycles including successfully defending a Practical (or Exercise) thesis (Le Doctorat en Medecine) on an area of interest), they are awarded : Diplôme d'État de docteur en médecine (State diploma of Doctor of Medicine) and Diplôme d'études spécialisées (DES) which are both needed for full registration on the National Council of the Order of Physicians (l'Ordre des médecins) and can practise medicine All Ghanaian medical schools award an MBChB as the basic medical degree after 6 academic years. These seven medical schools are Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, University of Ghana, University for Development Studies, University of Cape Coast, University of Health and Allied Sciences and the private Accra College of Medicine, and Family Health Medical School, another private medical school. The University of Guyana awards MB BS. Other ""offshore"" United-States-linked schools in the country award the North American MD, such as Texila American University, Lincoln American University.[citation needed] The awarding of qualifications in Hong Kong follows the British tradition. The dual degree is awarded as: In India the MBBS is generally a 5+1⁄2-year course including one year of mandatory internship and an additional year of mandatory rural posting. Some institutes like the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences and other Deemed Medical Colleges do not have the 1 year of mandatory rural posting. During internship, medical students are paid a stipend. Registration as MBBS doctor is granted after completion of these postings. MBBS in India comes under purview of the National Medical Commission which has the power to recognize or de-recognize medical colleges which provide MBBS education. Over the last decade, a number of medical colleges have been opened in India, to cater to the huge Indian population. The National Medical Commission mentions 704 medical colleges, which teach MBBS in the country, as in July 2023. There are both government run as well as private medical colleges in India. Admission to MBBS program in government colleges can be highly competitive because of subsidized education and extensive hands-on experience. Every year, millions of students appear for the national competitive examination National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate) for a total of 107,798 MBBS seats in the country, as of July 2023. The MBBS course starts with the basic pre and para-clinical subjects such as biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, microbiology, pathology, forensic medicine including toxicology and pharmacology. The students simultaneously obtain hands-on training in the wards and out-patient departments, where they interact with real patients for five years. The curriculum aims to inculcate standard protocols of history taking, examination, differential diagnosis and complete patient Management. The student is taught to determine what investigations will be useful for a patient and what are the best treatment options. The curriculum also contains a thorough practical knowledge and practice of performing standard clinical procedures. The course also contains a 12-month-long internship, in which an intern is rotated across various specialties. Besides standard clinical care, one also gets a thorough experience of ward management, staff management, and thorough counselling skills. After 1 year of rotatory internship, additional years of rural internship is mandatory in many states, which can be skipped by paying a huge fine to the government, for obtaining permanent registration as a medical practitioner. MBBS curriculum in India is going through changes with incorporation of modern teaching methods and introduction of National Exit Test (NExT) as the exit test for obtaining MBBS degree, notified on 30 June 2023. In Indonesia, graduating students are awarded the academic degree of Sarjana Kedokteran / Bachelor of Medicine (written as suffix ""S.Ked"") after completing their pre-clinical studies. At this point, the graduate is not yet a practising doctor, but may choose to work directly as a medical scientist or other non-clinician professions (usually health-related). However, most graduates will pursue the conventional path, which is to enroll in the clinical clerkship program (Program Pendidikan Profesi Dokter) for another 1.5 to 2 years. During this program, students are required to rotate through different medical/surgical specialties in a teaching hospital, actively involved in diagnoses and treatment of patients under the direct supervision of residents and consultants/attending physicians. After completing a clinical clerkship, students take the national medical licensing examination (Ujian Kompetensi Mahasiswa Program Profesi Dokter/UKMPPD) and will be awarded the title Dokter (written as prefix ""dr."") as their first professional title if they pass the examination. All medical schools in Iraq award MB ChB, with the exception of the University of Kurdistan-Hewlêr which awards the MBBS degree.[citation needed] The medical schools in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland – Queen's University Belfast, Trinity College Dublin, some constituent institutions of the National University of Ireland (University College Dublin, University College Cork and University of Galway), and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland — award the degrees of MB BCh BAO. The letters BAO stand for Baccalaureus in Arte Obstetricia (Bachelor of Obstetrics), a degree unique to Ireland which the Irish universities added in the 19th century as the legislation at the time insisted on a final examination in obstetrics. This third degree is an anachronism which is not registerable with the Irish Medical Council nor the British General Medical Council (GMC). The only exception is the newly established University of Limerick graduate entry school of medicine which awards BM BS for Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery. At Trinity College Dublin, the preclinical course leads to an additional Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree (upgradable after three or four years to Master of Arts); as originally after this most students used to go elsewhere to complete clinical training. LRCPI LRCSI, or simply LRCP&SI, denotes a holder of the historical non-university qualifying licentiates awarded jointly by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland to students of the RCSI's medical school under the Irish Conjoint Scheme. Unlike the corresponding licentiates awarded by the Royal Colleges in Scotland and England (which were external qualifications), these qualifications are still registerable with the Irish Medical Council, but not with the British GMC. Students at RCSI still receive these licences but now also receive the degrees MB BCh BAO, due to RCSI's status as a recognised college of the National University of Ireland. The RCSI students received a Licence in Midwifery (LM) from each college, in the same way that the Irish universities granted BAO degrees, so their qualifications were sometimes expressed as L & LM, RCPI, L & LM, RCSI or more misleadingly as LLM, LRCPI LRCSI, or simply LRCP&SI. LAH formerly denoted a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Hall of Ireland, and is no longer awarded. In Japan, medical undergraduates are awarded a Bachelor of Medicine, a course of study lasting six years. It is awarded by 42 national, 8 public and 31 private universities. The Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBS) degree is awarded in Jordan.[citation needed] The national universities with medical faculties in Kenya, namely Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, University of Nairobi, Aga Khan University, Moi University, Kenyatta University, Egerton University, Maseno University and Kenya Methodist University award MB ChB. Mount Kenya University and Egerton University also award the four-year BSc. Clinical Medicine degree in addition to the six-year MBChB.[citation needed] The AM. Dogliotti College of Medicine (University of Libeira) awards the MD degree. There are three major public medical universities in Libya, University of Tripoli (Tripoli), University of Benghazi (formerly Garyounis) (Benghazi), and University of Alzaweyah. The schools award the MBBCh. The Libyan International Medical University is an accredited private medical university that awards an MBChB to its graduates.[citation needed] The MBBS is awarded by five public and 17 private universities.[citation needed] In Mexico, the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, the National Polytechnic Institute, the Metropolitan Autonomous University, among others, grant the title of ""Médico cirujano"" (Physician-surgeon) after five or six years of post-high school education, plus one year of internship and one year of social service depending on each institution. All five medical schools (UM1, UM 2, DSMA, UMM, UMMG) in Myanmar award the MB BS.[citation needed] The University of Namibia UNAM School of Medicine, the only medical school in the country, awards the MBChB degree.[citation needed] There are 18 medical schools in Nepal that award the MBBS degree. Medical education commission, Nepal (MEC) organizes the work related to establishment and operation of medical institutions all over Nepal and bears the sole responsibility to maintain quality, professionalism, institutional accountability and social justice in medical education. There is another entity called Nepal Medical Council (NMC) which major functions are quality control of medical education of the country, establish ethical health care practice, establish standardization of medical practice as well as responsible for giving license to practise medicine within the country's border. In the Netherlands, students follow a period of 6 academic years. After three years, students obtain the title Bachelor Geneeskunde (translates to Bachelor of Medicine). After a further three years of study and internships, students obtain the Master Geneeskunde (translates to Master of Medicine) title. After the completion of the master's degree, the students are recognized as medical doctors. The two New Zealand medical schools, Auckland and Otago, style their degrees as ""MBChB"" and ""MB ChB"" respectively. The MBBS/MB ChB is awarded by many public and private universities in Nigeria, after a period of 6 academic years.[citation needed] In Pakistan, a medical school is more often referred to as a medical college. The full-form of MBBS is Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery. It is a 5-year course plus one-year internship in affiliated hospital that can be completed from a college recognized by the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council, to receive a degree titled MBBS (Medical colleges in Pakistan). Medical colleges may also teach Post Graduate courses such as FCPS and diplomas. A medical college is affiliated with a university as a department which usually has a separate campus. Currently, a total of 127 medical colleges are listed in World Directory of Medical Schools in Pakistan. All medical colleges and universities are regulated by the respective provincial department of health. They, however, have to be recognised after meeting criteria set by a central regulatory authority called Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC). Entrance into the medical colleges is based on merit under the guidelines of PMDC. Both the academic performance at the HSSC (grades 11–12) and a centralized entrance test like NMDCAT, are taken into consideration for the eligibility to enter most of the medical colleges. To get admission into any government medical college, the weightage is determined by the provincial or federal government. In order to get admission into any private medical college, the following weightage is used: All Rwandan medical schools, public and private, award an MBBS as the basic medical degree after completion of five or six academic years.[citation needed] Medical schools in Saudi Arabia award the MBBS. The Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore and the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine at Nanyang Technological University confer MB BS. The American Duke University has a medical programme based in Singapore (Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School), but it follows the North American model of styling its degree Doctor of Medicine (MD) at master's degree level. Somali National University, Amoud University, Benadir University Salaam University and Hargeisa University award the MB ChB, East Africa University awards MMBS. The University of Pretoria, University of Cape Town, University of the Free State, University of Stellenbosch, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Walter Sisulu University and MEDUNSA all award MBChB, whereas the University of the Witwatersrand styles its degree as MBBCh.[citation needed] The University of Juba, University of Bahr El-Ghazal and Upper Nile University in South Sudan awards the MBBS degree after the successful completion of six academic years. In 1942, the University of Ceylon was established through legislation and the MBBS degree was recognised for registration of doctors in place of the Licentiate in Medicine and Surgery (LMS). The medical degree in Sudan is a six-year program that includes both classroom and clinical training. Students who successfully complete the program are awarded the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree, which is recognized internationally. The higher education in Syria provides training to a Diploma, Bachelor, Master, and Doctorate levels (see European Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency on Higher Education: Syria). Medical education in Tunisia is solely administered by the government Ministry of Higher Education and Ministry of Public Health. Students get permitted access to medical studies when succeeding their national baccalauréat exam and obtaining a competitive score that allows them admission to medical schools (usually in the 95% percentile). The curriculum spans six years, two years of fundamental medicine, followed by three years of clinical medicine, culminating in a final year of internship. Upon the completion of this comprehensive training, students are awarded a certificate equivalent to a bachelor's degree, known as the ""Diplome de Fin des Etudes Cliniques en Médecine."" Subsequently, a national exam is undertaken, and students are ranked based on their performance. Specialization in medicine then follows, ranging from an additional three years for family medicine to five years for most medical and surgical specialties. During the initial two years at medical school, students focus on foundational subjects such as physiology, semiology, and the fundamentals of medical examination. From the fourth year onwards, they engage in rotations at teaching hospitals, where they actively participate under the guidance of junior and senior physicians, honing their practical skills. At the conclusion of the fifth year, students undergo a competitive examination to determine their medical specialty and city of practice. Following this, they transition to full-time physicians, practising under supervision, and earn the title of ""doctors"" upon successful completion of their residency. The nine universities in Uganda that have medical schools that teach undergraduate courses, namely; Makerere University, Mbarara University, Gulu University, Kampala International University, Busitema University, Kabale University, Habib Medical School, St. Augustine International University, and Uganda Christian University all award the MBChB degree, after five years of study. In Ukraine, the full-form of MBBS is Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery. It is generally a 5.8 year course including one year compulsory internship, that can be completed from a college accredited by the National Medical Commission. At present, Ukraine is ranked at the fourth position in Europe for having the largest number of post graduates in fields of medicine. Ukraine has a number of Top Government Medical Universities offering MBBS, MD and other degrees in medicine to the local students as well as international students. The MBBS course starts with the basic pre and para-clinical subjects such as biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, microbiology, pathology, forensic medicine including toxicology and pharmacology. The students simultaneously obtain hands-on training in the wards and out-patient departments, where they interact with real patients for six years. The curriculum aims to inculcate standard protocols of history taking, examination, differential diagnosis and complete patient Management. The student is taught to determine what investigations will be useful for a patient and what are the best treatment options. The curriculum also contains a thorough practical knowledge and practice of performing standard clinical procedures. The course also contains a 12-month-long internship, in which an intern is rotated across various specialties. Besides standard clinical care, one also gets a thorough experience of ward management, staff management, and thorough counselling skills. The degree awarded is ""Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery"". The minimum requirements for the MBBS course are 50% marks in physics, chemistry, biology and English in a student's secondary school examinations and student need to pass National Eligibility cum Entrance Test examination for the admission in Ukraine Universities. While first degrees in medicine meet the expectations of the descriptor for higher education qualification at ""level 7 (the UK master's degree)"", these degrees usually retain, for historical reasons, ""Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery"" and are abbreviated to MBChB or MBBS. Varied abbreviations are used for these degrees in these areas: At the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the preclinical course leads to an additional Bachelor of Arts (BA), degree (upgradable after three or four years to Master of Arts), after which most students used to go elsewhere (but usually to one of the London teaching hospitals) to complete clinical training. They could then take the degrees of their new university: They used to have the options of returning to their old university to take the clinical examinations or taking one of the old non-university qualifying examinations. All students at Oxford and Cambridge now remain in place to take their clinical training. All medical schools in Scotland (Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow) award MB ChB. The University of St Andrews School of Medicine awarded MB ChB until the early 1970s, but since the incorporation of its clinical medical school into the University of Dundee, St Andrews now only awards a pre-clinical BSc or BSc (Hons), and students go to a Partner Medical School (Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, or Manchester), where they are awarded an MB ChB after a further three years' study. There is also a programme for Canadian Citizens and residents whereby they complete 3 years at St. Andrews, then 3 years at Edinburgh and are assisted with applying for residency back in Canada. Since 2018, a joint initiative coordinated by both the Universities of St Andrews and Dundee, the Scottish Graduate Entry Medicine (ScotGEM) programme, has based its first and second year students at St Andrews, and its third and fourth year students at Dundee. This is Scotland's first graduate entry medical degree programme. The intention is that the students of the inaugural cohort, due to graduate in July 2022, will be conferred a joint MB ChB by both universities – the first to graduate with this professional degree directly from St Andrews in over fifty years. The Scottish Triple Qualification of LRCPE, LRCSE, LRCPSG (earlier LRCPE, LRCSE, LRFPSG) is an old non-university qualifying examination in medicine and surgery awarded jointly by the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, previously through a Conjoint Board and from 1994 through the United Examining Board. The UEB was dissolved in 2007. These qualifications are still registrable with the GMC,[citation needed] but permission to award them was withdrawn by the Privy Council of the UK in 1999. The Conjoint diplomas LRCP MRCS LMSSA were non-university qualifying examinations in medicine and surgery awarded jointly by the Royal College of Physicians of London, Royal College of Surgeons of England and Society of Apothecaries through the United Examining Board from 1994 until 1999, when the General Medical Council withdrew permission. Before 1994, the English Conjoint diploma of LRCP, MRCS was awarded for 110 years, and the LMSSA was a distinct and sometimes less-esteemed qualification. These diplomas slowly became less popular among British medical students, but as recently as 1938 only a half of them qualified with university degrees. The diplomas came to be taken mostly by those who had already qualified in medicine overseas or who failed their medical school finals. International medical graduates with an MBBS from foreign countries are generally exempt from having to attend medical school in the United States, but must still undergo US residency and pass the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), which is given in three exams. The MBBS is not offered at medical schools in the United States as the majority of medical school programs are graduate entry and by tradition offer the MD degree as a primary medical qualification. There are a number of institutions in the United States that offer a combined 6-year BS-MD joint degree, notably Northeast Ohio Medical University whereby graduating high school seniors complete an accelerated bachelor's degree in two years followed by an MD at the traditional four-year pace. Although the BS-MD pathway is a hybrid undergraduate/graduate program, the result is a primary medical qualification equivalent to an MBBS degree and graduates of these schools go on to enter their intern year at roughly the same age as their UK counterparts. Most American schools offering a BS-MD program do so in 7 years, such as the Indiana University School of Medicine, or in 8 years, such as the Baylor College of Medicine. The Association of American Medical Colleges maintains a list of such schools. Primarily US-educated MDs and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (DOs) go through four years of undergraduate education and apply to professional medical graduate schools with a competitive Medical College Admission Test score and GPA. They then go through two more years of didactic medical science study, and take the pass-fail USMLE Step 1 exam. DO students take a similar exam known as COMLEX Level 1. Following a pass, they then undergo experiential learning of medicine by taking part in patient care in clinics and hospitals under the close supervision of board-certified physicians. After this year, they take the Step 2 Clinical Knowledge exam and formerly took the Step 2 Clinical Skills exam as well. DO students take the COMLEX Level 2-Cognitive Evaulation exam and previously took the COMLEX Level 2-Performance Evaluation exam. COMLEX 2-PE and Step 2 CS were discontinued in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. They then go through one more year of experiential learning, often with elective rotations tailored to particular interests",Wiki
Bacteria,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria,"And see text Bacteria (/bækˈtɪəriə/ ⓘ; sg.: bacterium) are ubiquitous, mostly free-living organisms often consisting of one biological cell. They constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit the air, soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep biosphere of Earth's crust. Bacteria play a vital role in many stages of the nutrient cycle by recycling nutrients and the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere. The nutrient cycle includes the decomposition of dead bodies; bacteria are responsible for the putrefaction stage in this process. In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, extremophile bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide and methane, to energy. Bacteria also live in mutualistic, commensal and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. Most bacteria have not been characterised and there are many species that cannot be grown in the laboratory. The study of bacteria is known as bacteriology, a branch of microbiology. Like all animals, humans carry vast numbers (approximately 1013 to 1014) of bacteria. Most are in the gut, though there are many on the skin. Most of the bacteria in and on the body are harmless or rendered so by the protective effects of the immune system, and many are beneficial, particularly the ones in the gut. However, several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, tuberculosis, tetanus and bubonic plague. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance a growing problem. Bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills, the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector (biomining, bioleaching), as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals. Once regarded as plants constituting the class Schizomycetes (""fission fungi""), bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes. Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes, bacterial cells contain circular chromosomes, do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles. Although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes, the scientific classification changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved from an ancient common ancestor. These evolutionary domains are called Bacteria and Archaea. Unlike Archaea, bacteria contain ester-linked lipids in the cell membrane, are resistant to diphtheria toxin, use formylmethionine in protein synthesis initiation, and have numerous genetic differences, including a different 16S rRNA. The word bacteria is the plural of the Neo-Latin bacterium, which is the romanisation of the Ancient Greek βακτήριον (baktḗrion), the diminutive of βακτηρία (baktēría), meaning ""staff, cane"", because the first ones to be discovered were rod-shaped. Although an estimated 43,000 species of bacteria have been named, most of them have never been studied. In fact, just 10 bacterial species account for half of all publications, whereas nearly 75% of all named bacteria don’t have a single paper devoted to them. The best-studied species, Escherichia coli, has more than 300,000 studies published on it, but many of these papers likely use it only as a cloning vehicle to study other species, without providing any insight into its own biology. 90% of scientific studies on bacteria focus on less than 1% of species, mostly pathogenic bacteria relevant to human health. While E. coli is probably the best-studied bacterium, a quarter of its 4000 genes are poorly studied or remain uncharacterized. Some bacteria with minimal genomes (< 600 genes, e.g. Mycoplasma) usually have a large fraction of their genes functionally characterized, given that most of them are essential and conserved in many other species. The ancestors of bacteria were unicellular microorganisms that were the first forms of life to appear on Earth, about 4 billion years ago. For about 3 billion years, most organisms were microscopic, and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms of life. Although bacterial fossils exist, such as stromatolites, their lack of distinctive morphology prevents them from being used to examine the history of bacterial evolution, or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species. However, gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial phylogeny, and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of bacteria and archaea was probably a hyperthermophile that lived about 2.5 billion–3.2 billion years ago. The earliest life on land may have been bacteria some 3.22 billion years ago. Bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence, that of the archaea and eukaryotes. Here, eukaryotes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into endosymbiotic associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells, which were themselves possibly related to the Archaea. This involved the engulfment by proto-eukaryotic cells of alphaproteobacterial symbionts to form either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes, which are still found in all known Eukarya (sometimes in highly reduced form, e.g. in ancient ""amitochondrial"" protozoa). Later, some eukaryotes that already contained mitochondria also engulfed cyanobacteria-like organisms, leading to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants. This is known as primary endosymbiosis. Bacteria are ubiquitous, living in every possible habitat on the planet including soil, underwater, deep in Earth's crust and even such extreme environments as acidic hot springs and radioactive waste. There are thought to be approximately 2×1030 bacteria on Earth, forming a biomass that is only exceeded by plants. They are abundant in lakes and oceans, in arctic ice, and geothermal springs where they provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide and methane, to energy. They live on and in plants and animals. Most do not cause diseases, are beneficial to their environments, and are essential for life. The soil is a rich source of bacteria and a few grams contain around a thousand million of them. They are all essential to soil ecology, breaking down toxic waste and recycling nutrients. They are even found in the atmosphere and one cubic metre of air holds around one hundred million bacterial cells. The oceans and seas harbour around 3 x 1026 bacteria which provide up to 50% of the oxygen humans breathe. Only around 2% of bacterial species have been fully studied. Size. Bacteria display a wide diversity of shapes and sizes. Bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5–5.0 micrometres in length. However, a few species are visible to the unaided eye—for example, Thiomargarita namibiensis is up to half a millimetre long, Epulopiscium fishelsoni reaches 0.7 mm, and Thiomargarita magnifica can reach even 2 cm in length, which is 50 times larger than other known bacteria. Among the smallest bacteria are members of the genus Mycoplasma, which measure only 0.3 micrometres, as small as the largest viruses. Some bacteria may be even smaller, but these ultramicrobacteria are not well-studied. Shape. Most bacterial species are either spherical, called cocci (singular coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of other unusual shapes have been described, such as star-shaped bacteria. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators. Multicellularity. Most bacterial species exist as single cells; others associate in characteristic patterns: Neisseria forms diploids (pairs), streptococci form chains, and staphylococci group together in ""bunch of grapes"" clusters. Bacteria can also group to form larger multicellular structures, such as the elongated filaments of Actinomycetota species, the aggregates of Myxobacteria species, and the complex hyphae of Streptomyces species. These multicellular structures are often only seen in certain conditions. For example, when starved of amino acids, myxobacteria detect surrounding cells in a process known as quorum sensing, migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500 micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells. In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; for example, about one in ten cells migrate to the top of a fruiting body and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called a myxospore, which is more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions. Biofilms. Bacteria often attach to surfaces and form dense aggregations called biofilms and larger formations known as microbial mats. These biofilms and mats can range from a few micrometres in thickness to up to half a metre in depth, and may contain multiple species of bacteria, protists and archaea. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures, such as microcolonies, through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients. In natural environments, such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms. Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of implanted medical devices, and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria. The bacterial cell is surrounded by a cell membrane, which is made primarily of phospholipids. This membrane encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients, proteins and other essential components of the cytoplasm within the cell. Unlike eukaryotic cells, bacteria usually lack large membrane-bound structures in their cytoplasm such as a nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts and the other organelles present in eukaryotic cells. However, some bacteria have protein-bound organelles in the cytoplasm which compartmentalise aspects of bacterial metabolism, such as the carboxysome. Additionally, bacteria have a multi-component cytoskeleton to control the localisation of proteins and nucleic acids within the cell, and to manage the process of cell division. Many important biochemical reactions, such as energy generation, occur due to concentration gradients across membranes, creating a potential difference analogous to a battery. The general lack of internal membranes in bacteria means these reactions, such as electron transport, occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the outside of the cell or periplasm. However, in many photosynthetic bacteria, the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria. Bacteria do not have a membrane-bound nucleus, and their genetic material is typically a single circular bacterial chromosome of DNA located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the nucleoid. The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA. Like all other organisms, bacteria contain ribosomes for the production of proteins, but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and archaea. Some bacteria produce intracellular nutrient storage granules, such as glycogen, polyphosphate, sulfur or polyhydroxyalkanoates. Bacteria such as the photosynthetic cyanobacteria, produce internal gas vacuoles, which they use to regulate their buoyancy, allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels. Around the outside of the cell membrane is the cell wall. Bacterial cell walls are made of peptidoglycan (also called murein), which is made from polysaccharide chains cross-linked by peptides containing D-amino acids. Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fungi, which are made of cellulose and chitin, respectively. The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of achaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan. The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria, and the antibiotic penicillin (produced by a fungus called Penicillium) is able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan. There are broadly speaking two different types of cell wall in bacteria, that classify bacteria into Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. The names originate from the reaction of cells to the Gram stain, a long-standing test for the classification of bacterial species. Gram-positive bacteria possess a thick cell wall containing many layers of peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Most bacteria have the Gram-negative cell wall, and only members of the Bacillota group and actinomycetota (previously known as the low G+C and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria, respectively) have the alternative Gram-positive arrangement. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, vancomycin can kill only Gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against Gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Some bacteria have cell wall structures that are neither classically Gram-positive or Gram-negative. This includes clinically important bacteria such as mycobacteria which have a thick peptidoglycan cell wall like a Gram-positive bacterium, but also a second outer layer of lipids. In many bacteria, an S-layer of rigidly arrayed protein molecules covers the outside of the cell. This layer provides chemical and physical protection for the cell surface and can act as a macromolecular diffusion barrier. S-layers have diverse functions and are known to act as virulence factors in Campylobacter species and contain surface enzymes in Bacillus stearothermophilus. Flagella are rigid protein structures, about 20 nanometres in diameter and up to 20 micrometres in length, that are used for motility. Flagella are driven by the energy released by the transfer of ions down an electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane. Fimbriae (sometimes called ""attachment pili"") are fine filaments of protein, usually 2–10 nanometres in diameter and up to several micrometres in length. They are distributed over the surface of the cell, and resemble fine hairs when seen under the electron microscope. Fimbriae are believed to be involved in attachment to solid surfaces or to other cells, and are essential for the virulence of some bacterial pathogens. Pili (sing. pilus) are cellular appendages, slightly larger than fimbriae, that can transfer genetic material between bacterial cells in a process called conjugation where they are called conjugation pili or sex pili (see bacterial genetics, below). They can also generate movement where they are called type IV pili. Glycocalyx is produced by many bacteria to surround their cells, and varies in structural complexity: ranging from a disorganised slime layer of extracellular polymeric substances to a highly structured capsule. These structures can protect cells from engulfment by eukaryotic cells such as macrophages (part of the human immune system). They can also act as antigens and be involved in cell recognition, as well as aiding attachment to surfaces and the formation of biofilms. The assembly of these extracellular structures is dependent on bacterial secretion systems. These transfer proteins from the cytoplasm into the periplasm or into the environment around the cell. Many types of secretion systems are known and these structures are often essential for the virulence of pathogens, so are intensively studied. Some genera of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporohalobacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobacterium, can form highly resistant, dormant structures called endospores. Endospores develop within the cytoplasm of the cell; generally, a single endospore develops in each cell. Each endospore contains a core of DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by a multilayer rigid coat composed of peptidoglycan and a variety of proteins. Endospores show no detectable metabolism and can survive extreme physical and chemical stresses, such as high levels of UV light, gamma radiation, detergents, disinfectants, heat, freezing, pressure, and desiccation. In this dormant state, these organisms may remain viable for millions of years. Endospores even allow bacteria to survive exposure to the vacuum and radiation of outer space, leading to the possibility that bacteria could be distributed throughout the universe by space dust, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planetoids, or directed panspermia. Endospore-forming bacteria can cause disease; for example, anthrax can be contracted by the inhalation of Bacillus anthracis endospores, and contamination of deep puncture wounds with Clostridium tetani endospores causes tetanus, which, like botulism, is caused by a toxin released by the bacteria that grow from the spores. Clostridioides difficile infection, a common problem in healthcare settings, is caused by spore-forming bacteria. Bacteria exhibit an extremely wide variety of metabolic types. The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their taxonomy, but these traits often do not correspond with modern genetic classifications. Bacterial metabolism is classified into nutritional groups on the basis of three major criteria: the source of energy, the electron donors used, and the source of carbon used for growth. Phototrophic bacteria derive energy from light using photosynthesis, while chemotrophic bacteria breaking down chemical compounds through oxidation, driving metabolism by transferring electrons from a given electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor in a redox reaction. Chemotrophs are further divided by the types of compounds they use to transfer electrons. Bacteria that derive electrons from inorganic compounds such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, or ammonia are called lithotrophs, while those that use organic compounds are called organotrophs. Still, more specifically, aerobic organisms use oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor, while anaerobic organisms use other compounds such as nitrate, sulfate, or carbon dioxide. Many bacteria, called heterotrophs, derive their carbon from other organic carbon. Others, such as cyanobacteria and some purple bacteria, are autotrophic, meaning they obtain cellular carbon by fixing carbon dioxide. In unusual circumstances, the gas methane can be used by methanotrophic bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism. In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. For example, diazotrophs have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This trait, which can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above, leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are important drivers in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Nonrespiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves. Unlike in multicellular organisms, increases in cell size (cell growth) and reproduction by cell division are tightly linked in unicellular organisms. Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission, a form of asexual reproduction. Under optimal conditions, bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly, and some bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 17 minutes. In cell division, two identical clone daughter cells are produced. Some bacteria, while still reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells. Examples include fruiting body formation by myxobacteria and aerial hyphae formation by Streptomyces species, or budding. Budding involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a daughter cell. In the laboratory, bacteria are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid growth media, such as agar plates, are used to isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth media are used when the measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms. Most laboratory techniques for growing bacteria use high levels of nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly. However, in natural environments, nutrients are limited, meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely. This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies (see r/K selection theory). Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available, such as the formation of algal and cyanobacterial blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer. Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments, such as the production of multiple antibiotics by Streptomyces that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms. In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g., biofilms) that may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses. These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms (syntrophy). Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a population of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the lag phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the logarithmic phase, also known as the exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die. Most bacteria have a single circular chromosome that can range in size from only 160,000 base pairs in the endosymbiotic bacteria Carsonella ruddii, to 12,200,000 base pairs (12.2 Mbp) in the soil-dwelling bacteria Sorangium cellulosum. There are many exceptions to this; for example, some Streptomyces and Borrelia species contain a single linear chromosome, while some bacteria including species of Vibrio contain more than one chromosome. Some bacteria contain plasmids, small extra-chromosomal molecules of DNA that may contain genes for various useful functions such as antibiotic resistance, metabolic capabilities, or various virulence factors. Whether they have a single chromosome or more than one, almost all bacteria have a haploid genome. This means that they have only one copy of each gene encoding proteins. This is in contrast to eukaryotes, which are diploid or polyploid, meaning they have two or more copies of each gene. This means that unlike humans, who may still be able to create a protein if the gene becomes mutated (since the human genome has an extra copy in each cell), a bacterium will be completely unable to create the protein if its gene incurs an inactivating mutation. Bacterial genomes usually encode a few hundred to a few thousand genes. The genes in bacterial genomes are usually a single continuous stretch of DNA. Although several different types of introns do exist in bacteria, these are much rarer than in eukaryotes. Bacteria, as asexual organisms, inherit an identical copy of the parent's genome and are clonal. However, all bacteria can evolve by selection on changes to their genetic material DNA caused by genetic recombination or mutations. Mutations arise from errors made during the replication of DNA or from exposure to mutagens. Mutation rates vary widely among different species of bacteria and even among different clones of a single species of bacteria. Genetic changes in bacterial genomes emerge from either random mutation during replication or ""stress-directed mutation"", where genes involved in a particular growth-limiting process have an increased mutation rate. Some bacteria transfer genetic material between cells. This can occur in three main ways. First, bacteria can take up exogenous DNA from their environment in a process called transformation. Many bacteria can naturally take up DNA from the environment, while others must be chemically altered in order to induce them to take up DNA. The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells. Second, bacteriophages can integrate into the bacterial chromosome, introducing foreign DNA in a process known as transduction. Many types of bacteriophage exist; some infect and lyse their host bacteria, while others insert into the bacterial chromosome. Bacteria resist phage infection through restriction modification systems that degrade foreign DNA and a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that the bacteria have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference. Third, bacteria can transfer genetic material through direct cell contact via conjugation. In ordinary circumstances, transduction, conjugation, and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species, and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Many bacteria are motile (able to move themselves) and do so using a variety of mechanisms. The best studied of these are flagella, long filaments that are turned by a motor at the base to generate propeller-like movement. The bacterial flagellum is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly. The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power. Bacteria can use flagella in different ways to generate different kinds of movement. Many bacteria (such as E. coli) have two distinct modes of movement: forward movement (swimming) and tumbling. The tumbling allows them to reorient and makes their movement a three-dimensional random walk. Bacterial species differ in the number and arrangement of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum (monotrichous), a flagellum at each end (amphitrichous), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (lophotrichous), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell (peritrichous). The flagella of a group of bacteria, the spirochaetes, are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space. They have a distinctive helical body that twists about as it moves. Two other types of bacterial motion are called twitching motility that relies on a structure called the type IV pilus, and gliding motility, that uses other mechanisms. In twitching motility, the rod-like pilus extends out from the cell, binds some substrate, and then retracts, pulling the cell forward. Motile bacteria are attracted or repelled by certain stimuli in behaviours called taxes: these include chemotaxis, phototaxis, energy taxis, and magnetotaxis. In one peculiar group, the myxobacteria, individual bacteria move together to form waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores. The myxobacteria move only when on solid surfaces, unlike E. coli, which is motile in liquid or solid media. Several Listeria and Shigella species move inside host cells by usurping the cytoskeleton, which is normally used to move organelles inside the cell. By promoting actin polymerisation at one pole of their cells, they can form a kind of tail that pushes them through the host cell's cytoplasm. A few bacteria have chemical systems that generate light. This bioluminescence often occurs in bacteria that live in association with fish, and the light probably serves to attract fish or other large animals. Bacteria often function as multicellular aggregates known as biofilms, exchanging a variety of molecular signals for intercell communication and engaging in coordinated multicellular behaviour. The communal benefits of multicellular cooperation include a cellular division of labour, accessing resources that cannot effectively be used by single cells, collectively defending against antagonists, and optimising population survival by differentiating into distinct cell types. For example, bacteria in biofilms can have more than five hundred times increased resistance to antibacterial agents than individual ""planktonic"" bacteria of the same species. One type of intercellular communication by a molecular signal is called quorum sensing, which serves the purpose of determining whether the local population density is sufficient to support investment in processes that are only successful if large numbers of similar organisms behave similarly, such as excreting digestive enzy",Wiki
Bacteriology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriology,"Bacteriology is the branch and specialty of biology that studies the morphology, ecology, genetics and biochemistry of bacteria as well as many other aspects related to them. This subdivision of microbiology involves the identification, classification, and characterization of bacterial species. Because of the similarity of thinking and working with microorganisms other than bacteria, such as protozoa, fungi, and non-microorganism viruses, there has been a tendency for the field of bacteriology to extend as microbiology. The terms were formerly often used interchangeably. However, bacteriology can be classified as a distinct science. Bacteriology is the study of bacteria and their relation to medicine. Bacteriology evolved from physicians needing to apply the germ theory to address the concerns relating to disease spreading in hospitals the 19th century. Identification and characterizing of bacteria being associated to diseases led to advances in pathogenic bacteriology. Koch's postulates played a role into identifying the relationships between bacteria and specific diseases. Since then, bacteriology has played a role in successful advances in science such as bacterial vaccines like diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid. Bacteriology can be studied and applied in many sub-fields relating to agriculture, marine biology, water pollution, bacterial genetics, veterinary medicine, biotechnology and others. A bacteriologist is a microbiologist or other trained professional in bacteriology. Bacteriologists are interested in studying and learning about bacteria, as well as using their skills in clinical settings. This includes investigating properties of bacteria such as morphology, ecology, genetics and biochemistry, phylogenetics, genomics and many other areas related to bacteria like disease diagnostic testing. They can also work as medical scientists, veterinary scientists, or diagnostic technicians in locations like clinics, blood banks, hospitals, laboratories and animal hospitals. Bacteriologists working in public health or biomedical research help develop vaccines for public use. The growth of bacteria in laboratory cultures is the mainstay method used by bacteriologists. Both solid and liquid culture media are used. Solid culture medium is usually nutrient agar in a petri dish. The constituents of the nutrient agar vary according to the bacteria under investigation. For growing the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae, for example, which is dependent on hemin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide for its growth, blood (usually from a sheep or a horse) is added to the medium. When growing bacteria that are found in the intestines of mammals, such as salmonella, XLD agar which contains, among other ingredients deoxycholic acid is used. Bacteria were first observed by the Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1676, using a single-lens microscope of his own design. Leeuwenhoek did not recognize bacteria as a distinct category of microorganisms, and referred to all microorganisms, including bacteria, protists, and microscopic animals, as animalcules. He published his observations in a series of letters to the Royal Society of London. His observations also included protozoans. The German Ferdinand Cohn began studying bacteria in 1870 and is also said to be a founder of bacteriology, as he was the first to classify bacteria into groups based on their cell shapes. He defined bacteria as ""chlorophyll-free cells of spherical, oblong, or cylindrical form, sometimes twisted or bent, which multiply exclusively by transverse division and occur either isolated or in cell families,"" and placed them in the plant kingdom. He also discovered heat-resistant bacterial endospores Louis Pasteur demonstrated in 1859 that microorganisms cause the fermentation process, and that this growth is not due to spontaneous generation (yeasts and molds, commonly associated with fermentation, are not bacteria, but rather fungi). Along with his contemporary Robert Koch, Pasteur was an early advocate of the germ theory of disease. Between 1880 and 1881 Pasteur produced two successful vaccinations for animals against diseases caused by bacteria. The importance of bacteria was recognized as it led to a study of disease prevention and treatment of diseases by vaccines. Pasteur's research led to Ignaz Semmelweis and Joseph Lister researching the importance of sanitized hands in medical work. In the 1840s, Semmelweis' observations and ideas surrounding sanitary techniques were rejected and his book on the topic condemned by the medical community due to its conflict with the prevailing theory and practice of humorism at the time. After Lister's publications, which supported hand washing and sanitation with germ theory, doctors started sanitizing their hands in the 1870s; mandatory handwashing was not incorporated into common health practice until as late as the 1980s. The discovery of the connection of microorganisms to disease came later in the nineteenth century, when Italian anatomist Filippo Pacini isolated the cholera bacterium Vibrio cholerae in 1854 in Florence during the Asiatic Cholera Pandemic of 1846–63 and clearly linked the presence of the bacterium in the intestinal mucosa of dead cholera patients to the disease. Although Pacini's work was available to the international scientific community via French and English translations, the discovery of the cholera-causing agent is often attributed to the German physician Robert Koch who rediscovered it in 1884. Koch is credited for introducing the science of microorganisms including bacteria to the medical field. Koch, a pioneer in medical microbiology, worked on cholera, anthrax and tuberculosis. In his research into tuberculosis Koch finally proved the germ theory, for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1905. In Koch's postulates, he set out criteria to test if an organism is the cause of a disease, and these postulates are still used today. Both Koch and Pasteur played a role in improving antisepsis in medical treatment. In 1870–1885 the modern methods of bacteriology technique were introduced by the use of stains, and by the method of separating mixtures of organisms on plates of nutrient media. Though it had been known since the nineteenth century that bacteria are a cause of many diseases, no effective antibacterial treatments were available until the 20th century. In 1910, Paul Ehrlich developed the first antibiotic, by changing dyes that selectively stained Treponema pallidum—the spirochaete that causes syphilis—into compounds that selectively killed the pathogen. Ehrlich was awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize for his work on immunology, and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria, with his work being the basis of the Gram stain and the Ziehl–Neelsen stain. In the early 20th century, there was debate about the classification of bacteria. In 1904, cyanobacteria were usually classified as a class of algae, which are eukaryotic. However, Haeckel at this time classed cyanobacteria with bacteria because they lacked nuclei. In 1938, Herbert Faulkner Copeland proposed that prokaryotes be granted their own kingdom. The development of the transmission electron microscope allowed better visualization of cell structure and helped to clarify issues. In 1962, Stanier and van Niel published an influential definition of bacteria, proposing that bacteria be defined as prokaryotic cellular entities; they also specified three differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes: presence or absence of internal membranes, division by fission or mitosis, and presence or absence of a cell wall. A major step forward in the study of bacteria came in 1977 when Carl Woese recognised that archaea have a separate line of evolutionary descent from bacteria. This new phylogenetic taxonomy came from the sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA and divided prokaryotes into two evolutionary domains as part of the three-domain system.",Wiki
Baroque_Era,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_Era,"The Baroque (UK: /bəˈrɒk/ bə-ROK, US: /bəˈroʊk/ bə-ROHK, French: [baʁɔk]) is a Western style of architecture, music, dance, painting, sculpture, poetry, and other arts that flourished from the early 17th century until the 1750s. It followed Renaissance art and Mannerism and preceded the Rococo (in the past often referred to as ""late Baroque"") and Neoclassical styles. It was encouraged by the Catholic Church as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of Protestant architecture, art, and music, though Lutheran Baroque art developed in parts of Europe as well. The Baroque style used contrast, movement, exuberant detail, deep color, grandeur, and surprise to achieve a sense of awe. The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome, then spread rapidly to the rest of Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal, then to Austria, southern Germany, Poland and Russia. By the 1730s, it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called rocaille or Rococo, which appeared in France and Central Europe until the mid to late 18th century. In the territories of the Spanish and Portuguese Empires including the Iberian Peninsula it continued, together with new styles, until the first decade of the 19th century. In the decorative arts, the style employs plentiful and intricate ornamentation. The departure from Renaissance classicism has its own ways in each country. But a general feature is that everywhere the starting point is the ornamental elements introduced by the Renaissance. The classical repertoire is crowded, dense, overlapping, loaded, in order to provoke shock effects. New motifs introduced by Baroque are: the cartouche, trophies and weapons, baskets of fruit or flowers, and others, made in marquetry, stucco, or carved. The English word baroque comes directly from the French. Some scholars state that the French word originated from the Portuguese term barroco 'a flawed pearl', pointing to the Latin verruca 'wart', or to a word with the Romance suffix -ǒccu (common in pre-Roman Iberia). Other sources suggest a Medieval Latin term used in logic, baroco, as the most likely source. In the 16th century the Medieval Latin word baroco moved beyond scholastic logic and came into use to characterise anything that seemed absurdly complex. The French philosopher Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) helped to give the term baroco (spelled Barroco by him) the meaning 'bizarre, uselessly complicated'. Other early sources associate baroco with magic, complexity, confusion, and excess. The word baroque was also associated with irregular pearls before the 18th century. The French baroque and Portuguese barroco were terms often associated with jewelry. An example from 1531 uses the term to describe pearls in an inventory of Charles V of France's treasures. Later, the word appears in a 1694 edition of Le Dictionnaire de l'Académie Française, which describes baroque as ""only used for pearls that are imperfectly round."" A 1728 Portuguese dictionary similarly describes barroco as relating to a ""coarse and uneven pearl"". An alternative derivation of the word baroque points to the name of the Italian painter Federico Barocci (1528–1612). In the 18th century the term began to be used to describe music, and not in a flattering way. In an anonymous satirical review of the première of Jean-Philippe Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie in October 1733, which was printed in the Mercure de France in May 1734, the critic wrote that the novelty in this opera was ""du barocque"", complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was unsparing with dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device. In 1762 Le Dictionnaire de l'Académie Française recorded that the term could figuratively describe something ""irregular, bizarre or unequal"". Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who was a musician and composer as well as a philosopher, wrote in the Encyclopédie in 1768: ""Baroque music is that in which the harmony is confused, and loaded with modulations and dissonances. The singing is harsh and unnatural, the intonation difficult, and the movement limited. It appears that term comes from the word 'baroco' used by logicians."" In 1788 Quatremère de Quincy defined the term in the Encyclopédie Méthodique as ""an architectural style that is highly adorned and tormented"". The French terms style baroque and musique baroque appeared in Le Dictionnaire de l'Académie Française in 1835. By the mid-19th century, art critics and historians had adopted the term baroque as a way to ridicule post-Renaissance art. This was the sense of the word as used in 1855 by the leading art historian Jacob Burckhardt, who wrote that baroque artists ""despised and abused detail"" because they lacked ""respect for tradition"". In 1888 the art historian Heinrich Wölfflin published the first serious academic work on the style, Renaissance und Barock, which described the differences between the painting, sculpture, and architecture of the Renaissance and the Baroque. The Baroque style of architecture was a result of doctrines adopted by the Catholic Church at the Council of Trent in 1545–1563, in response to the Protestant Reformation. The first phase of the Counter-Reformation had imposed a severe, academic style on religious architecture, which had appealed to intellectuals but not the mass of churchgoers. The Council of Trent decided instead to appeal to a more popular audience, and declared that the arts should communicate religious themes with direct and emotional involvement. Similarly, Lutheran Baroque art developed as a confessional marker of identity, in response to the Great Iconoclasm of Calvinists. Baroque churches were designed with a large central space, where the worshippers could be close to the altar, with a dome or cupola high overhead, allowing light to illuminate the church below. The dome was one of the central symbolic features of Baroque architecture illustrating the union between the heavens and the earth. The inside of the cupola was lavishly decorated with paintings of angels and saints, and with stucco statuettes of angels, giving the impression to those below of looking up at heaven. Another feature of Baroque churches are the quadratura; trompe-l'œil paintings on the ceiling in stucco frames, either real or painted, crowded with paintings of saints and angels and connected by architectural details with the balustrades and consoles. Quadratura paintings of Atlantes below the cornices appear to be supporting the ceiling of the church. Unlike the painted ceilings of Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel, which combined different scenes, each with its own perspective, to be looked at one at a time, the Baroque ceiling paintings were carefully created so the viewer on the floor of the church would see the entire ceiling in correct perspective, as if the figures were real. The interiors of Baroque churches became more and more ornate in the High Baroque, and focused around the altar, usually placed under the dome. The most celebrated baroque decorative works of the High Baroque are the Chair of Saint Peter (1647–1653) and St. Peter's Baldachin (1623–1634), both by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The Baldequin of St. Peter is an example of the balance of opposites in Baroque art; the gigantic proportions of the piece, with the apparent lightness of the canopy; and the contrast between the solid twisted columns, bronze, gold and marble of the piece with the flowing draperies of the angels on the canopy. The Dresden Frauenkirche serves as a prominent example of Lutheran Baroque art, which was completed in 1743 after being commissioned by the Lutheran city council of Dresden and was ""compared by eighteenth-century observers to St Peter's in Rome"". The twisted column in the interior of churches is one of the signature features of the Baroque. It gives both a sense of motion and also a dramatic new way of reflecting light. The cartouche was another characteristic feature of Baroque decoration. These were large plaques carved of marble or stone, usually oval and with a rounded surface, which carried images or text in gilded letters, and were placed as interior decoration or above the doorways of buildings, delivering messages to those below. They showed a wide variety of invention, and were found in all types of buildings, from cathedrals and palaces to small chapels. Baroque architects sometimes used forced perspective to create illusions. For the Palazzo Spada in Rome, Francesco Borromini used columns of diminishing size, a narrowing floor and a miniature statue in the garden beyond to create the illusion that a passageway was thirty meters long, when it was actually only seven meters long. A statue at the end of the passage appears to be life-size, though it is only sixty centimeters high. Borromini designed the illusion with the assistance of a mathematician. The first building in Rome to have a Baroque façade was the Church of the Gesù in 1584; it was plain by later Baroque standards, but marked a break with the traditional Renaissance façades that preceded it. The interior of this church remained very austere until the high Baroque, when it was lavishly ornamented. In Rome in 1605, Paul V became the first of series of popes who commissioned basilicas and church buildings designed to inspire emotion and awe through a proliferation of forms, and a richness of colours and dramatic effects. Among the most influential monuments of the Early Baroque were the façade of St. Peter's Basilica (1606–1619), and the new nave and loggia which connected the façade to Michelangelo's dome in the earlier church. The new design created a dramatic contrast between the soaring dome and the disproportionately wide façade, and the contrast on the façade itself between the Doric columns and the great mass of the portico. In the mid to late 17th century the style reached its peak, later termed the High Baroque. Many monumental works were commissioned by Popes Urban VIII and Alexander VII. The sculptor and architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini designed a new quadruple colonnade around St. Peter's Square (1656 to 1667). The three galleries of columns in a giant ellipse balance the oversize dome and give the Church and square a unity and the feeling of a giant theatre. Another major innovator of the Italian High Baroque was Francesco Borromini, whose major work was the Church of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane or Saint Charles of the Four Fountains (1634–1646). The sense of movement is given not by the decoration, but by the walls themselves, which undulate and by concave and convex elements, including an oval tower and balcony inserted into a concave traverse. The interior was equally revolutionary; the main space of the church was oval, beneath an oval dome. Painted ceilings, crowded with angels and saints and trompe-l'œil architectural effects, were an important feature of the Italian High Baroque. Major works included The Entry of Saint Ignatius into Paradise by Andrea Pozzo (1685–1695) in the Sant'Ignazio Church, Rome, and The Triumph of the Name of Jesus by Giovanni Battista Gaulli in the Church of the Gesù in Rome (1669–1683), which featured figures spilling out of the picture frame and dramatic oblique lighting and light-dark contrasts. The style spread quickly from Rome to other regions of Italy: It appeared in Venice in the church of Santa Maria della Salute (1631–1687) by Baldassare Longhena, a highly original octagonal form crowned with an enormous cupola. It appeared also in Turin, notably in the Chapel of the Holy Shroud (1668–1694) by Guarino Guarini. The style also began to be used in palaces; Guarini designed the Palazzo Carignano in Turin, while Longhena designed the Ca' Rezzonico on the Grand Canal, (1657), finished by Giorgio Massari with decorated with paintings by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. A series of massive earthquakes in Sicily required the rebuilding of most of them and several were built in the exuberant late Baroque or Rococo style. The Catholic Church in Spain, and particularly the Jesuits, were the driving force of Spanish Baroque architecture. The first major work in this style was the San Isidro Chapel in Madrid, begun in 1643 by Pedro de la Torre. It contrasted an extreme richness of ornament on the exterior with simplicity in the interior, divided into multiple spaces and using effects of light to create a sense of mystery. The Santiago de Compostela Cathedral was modernized with a series of Baroque additions beginning at the end of the 17th century, starting with a highly ornate bell tower (1680), then flanked by two even taller and more ornate towers, called the Obradorio, added between 1738 and 1750 by Fernando de Casas Novoa. Another landmark of the Spanish Baroque is the chapel tower of the Palace of San Telmo in Seville by Leonardo de Figueroa. Granada had only been conquered from the Moors in the 15th century, and had its own distinct variety of Baroque. The painter, sculptor and architect Alonso Cano designed the Baroque interior of Granada Cathedral between 1652 and his death in 1657. It features dramatic contrasts of the massive white columns and gold decor. The most ornamental and lavishly decorated architecture of the Spanish Baroque is called Churrigueresque style, named after the brothers Churriguera, who worked primarily in Salamanca and Madrid. Their works include the buildings on Salamanca's main square, the Plaza Mayor (1729). This highly ornamental Baroque style was influential in many churches and cathedrals built by the Spanish in the Americas. Other notable Spanish baroque architects of the late Baroque include Pedro de Ribera, a pupil of Churriguera, who designed the Real Hospicio de San Fernando in Madrid, and Narciso Tomé, who designed the celebrated El Transparente altarpiece at Toledo Cathedral (1729–1732) which gives the illusion, in certain light, of floating upwards. The architects of the Spanish Baroque had an effect far beyond Spain; their work was highly influential in the churches built in the Spanish colonies in Latin America and the Philippines. The church built by the Jesuits for the College of San Francisco Javier in Tepotzotlán, with its ornate Baroque façade and tower, is a good example. From 1680 to 1750, many highly ornate cathedrals, abbeys, and pilgrimage churches were built in Central Europe, Austria, Bohemia and southwestern Poland. Some were in Rococo style, a distinct, more flamboyant and asymmetric style which emerged from the Baroque, then replaced it in Central Europe in the first half of the 18th century, until it was replaced in turn by classicism. The princes of the multitude of states in that region also chose Baroque or Rococo for their palaces and residences, and often used Italian-trained architects to construct them. A notable example is the St. Nicholas Church (Malá Strana) in Prague (1704–1755), built by Christoph Dientzenhofer and his son Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer. Decoration covers all of walls of interior of the church. The altar is placed in the nave beneath the central dome, and surrounded by chapels, light comes down from the dome above and from the surrounding chapels. The altar is entirely surrounded by arches, columns, curved balustrades and pilasters of coloured stone, which are richly decorated with statuary, creating a deliberate confusion between the real architecture and the decoration. The architecture is transformed into a theatre of light, colour and movement. In Poland, the Italian-inspired Polish Baroque lasted from the early 17th to the mid-18th century and emphasised richness of detail and colour. The first Baroque building in present-day Poland and probably one of the most recognizable is the Saints Peter and Paul Church, Kraków, designed by Giovanni Battista Trevano. Sigismund's Column in Warsaw, erected in 1644, was the world's first secular Baroque monument built in the form of a column. The palatial residence style was exemplified by the Wilanów Palace, constructed between 1677 and 1696. The most renowned Baroque architect active in Poland was Dutchman Tylman van Gameren and his notable works include Warsaw's St. Kazimierz Church and Krasiński Palace, Church of St. Anne, Kraków and Branicki Palace, Białystok. However, the most celebrated work of Polish Baroque is the Poznań Fara Church, with details by Pompeo Ferrari. After Thirty Years' War under the agreements of the Peace of Westphalia two unique baroque wattle and daub structures was built: Church of Peace in Jawor, Holy Trinity Church of Peace in Świdnica the largest wooden Baroque temple in Europe. The many states within the Holy Roman Empire on the territory of today's Germany all looked to represent themselves with impressive Baroque buildings. Notable architects included Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, Lukas von Hildebrandt and Dominikus Zimmermann in Bavaria, Balthasar Neumann in Bruhl, and Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann in Dresden. In Prussia, Frederick II of Prussia was inspired by the Grand Trianon of the Palace of Versailles, and used it as the model for his summer residence, Sanssouci, in Potsdam, designed for him by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff (1745–1747). Another work of Baroque palace architecture is the Zwinger (Dresden), the former orangerie of the palace of the electors of Saxony in the 18th century. One of the best examples of a rococo church is the Basilika Vierzehnheiligen, or Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, a pilgrimage church located near the town of Bad Staffelstein near Bamberg, in Bavaria, southern Germany. The Basilica was designed by Balthasar Neumann and was constructed between 1743 and 1772, its plan a series of interlocking circles around a central oval with the altar placed in the exact centre of the church. The interior of this church illustrates the summit of Rococo decoration. Another notable example of the style is the Pilgrimage Church of Wies (German: Wieskirche). It was designed by the brothers J. B. and Dominikus Zimmermann. It is located in the foothills of the Alps, in the municipality of Steingaden in the Weilheim-Schongau district, Bavaria, Germany. Construction took place between 1745 and 1754, and the interior was decorated with frescoes and with stuccowork in the tradition of the Wessobrunner School. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Baroque in France developed quite differently from the ornate and dramatic local versions of Baroque from Italy, Spain and the rest of Europe. It appears severe, more detached and restrained by comparison, preempting Neoclassicism and the architecture of the Enlightenment. Unlike Italian buildings, French Baroque buildings have no broken pediments or curvilinear façades. Even religious buildings avoided the intense spatial drama one finds in the work of Borromini. The style is closely associated with the works built for Louis XIV (reign 1643–1715), and because of this, it is also known as the Louis XIV style. Louis XIV invited the master of Baroque, Bernini, to submit a design for the new east wing of the Louvre, but rejected it in favor of a more classical design by Claude Perrault and Louis Le Vau. The main architects of the style included François Mansart (1598–1666), Pierre Le Muet (Church of Val-de-Grâce, 1645–1665) and Louis Le Vau (Vaux-le-Vicomte, 1657–1661). Mansart was the first architect to introduce Baroque styling, principally the frequent use of an applied order and heavy rustication, into the French architectural vocabulary. The mansard roof was not invented by Mansart, but it has become associated with him, as he used it frequently. The major royal project of the period was the expansion of Palace of Versailles, begun in 1661 by Le Vau with decoration by the painter Charles Le Brun. The gardens were designed by André Le Nôtre specifically to complement and amplify the architecture. The Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors), the centerpiece of the château, with paintings by Le Brun, was constructed between 1678 and 1686. Mansart completed the Grand Trianon in 1687. The chapel, designed by Robert de Cotte, was finished in 1710. Following the death of Louis XIV, Louis XV added the more intimate Petit Trianon and the highly ornate theatre. The fountains in the gardens were designed to be seen from the interior, and to add to the dramatic effect. The palace was admired and copied by other monarchs of Europe, particularly Peter the Great of Russia, who visited Versailles early in the reign of Louis XV, and built his own version at Peterhof Palace near Saint Petersburg, between 1705 and 1725. Baroque architecture in Portugal lasted about two centuries (the late seventeenth century and eighteenth century). The reigns of John V and Joseph I had increased imports of gold and diamonds, in a period called Royal Absolutism, which allowed the Portuguese Baroque to flourish. Baroque architecture in Portugal enjoys a special situation and different timeline from the rest of Europe. It is conditioned by several political, artistic, and economic factors, that originate several phases, and different kinds of outside influences, resulting in a unique blend, often misunderstood by those looking for Italian art, find instead specific forms and character which give it a uniquely Portuguese variety. Another key factor is the existence of the Jesuitical architecture, also called ""plain style"" (Estilo Chão or Estilo Plano) which like the name evokes, is plainer and appears somewhat austere. The buildings are single-room basilicas, deep main chapel, lateral chapels (with small doors for communication), without interior and exterior decoration, simple portal and windows. It is a practical building, allowing it to be built throughout the empire with minor adjustments, and prepared to be decorated later or when economic resources are available. In fact, the first Portuguese Baroque does not lack in building because ""plain style"" is easy to be transformed, by means of decoration (painting, tiling, etc.), turning empty areas into pompous, elaborate baroque scenarios. The same could be applied to the exterior. Subsequently, it is easy to adapt the building to the taste of the time and place, and add on new features and details. Practical and economical. With more inhabitants and better economic resources, the north, particularly the areas of Porto and Braga, witnessed an architectural renewal, visible in the large list of churches, convents and palaces built by the aristocracy. Porto is the city of Baroque in Portugal. Its historical centre is part of UNESCO World Heritage List. Many of the Baroque works in the historical area of the city and beyond, belong to Nicolau Nasoni an Italian architect living in Portugal, drawing original buildings with scenographic emplacement such as the church and tower of Clérigos, the logia of the Porto Cathedral, the church of Misericórdia, the Palace of São João Novo, the Palace of Freixo, the Episcopal Palace (Portuguese: Paço Episcopal do Porto) along with many others. The debut of Russian Baroque, or Petrine Baroque, followed a long visit of Peter the Great to western Europe in 1697–1698, where he visited the Châteaux of Fontainebleau and Versailles as well as other architectural monuments. He decided, on his return to Russia, to construct similar monuments in St. Petersburg, which became the new capital of Russia in 1712. Early major monuments in the Petrine Baroque include the Peter and Paul Cathedral and Menshikov Palace. During the reign of Anna and Elisabeth, Russian architecture was dominated by the luxurious Baroque style of Italian-born Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli, which developed into Elizabethan Baroque. Rastrelli's signature buildings include the Winter Palace, the Catherine Palace and the Smolny Cathedral. Other distinctive monuments of the Elizabethan Baroque are the bell tower of the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra and the Red Gate. In Moscow, Naryshkin Baroque became widespread, especially in the architecture of Eastern Orthodox churches in the late 17th century. It was a combination of western European Baroque with traditional Russian folk styles. Due to the colonization of the Americas by European countries, the Baroque naturally moved to the New World, finding especially favorable ground in the regions dominated by Spain and Portugal, both countries being centralized and irreducibly Catholic monarchies, by extension subject to Rome and adherents of the Baroque Counter-Reformation. European artists migrated to America and made school, and along with the widespread penetration of Catholic missionaries, many of whom were skilled artists, created a multiform Baroque often influenced by popular taste. The Criollo and indigenous crafters did much to give this Baroque unique features. The main centres of American Baroque cultivation, that are still standing, are (in this order) Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Cuba, Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico and Panama. Of particular note is the so-called ""Missionary Baroque"", developed in the framework of the Spanish reductions in areas extending from Mexico and southwestern portions of current-day United States to as far south as Argentina and Chile, indigenous settlements organized by Spanish Catholic missionaries in order to convert them to the Christian faith and acculturate them in the Western life, forming a hybrid Baroque influenced by Native culture, where flourished Criollos and many indigenous artisans and musicians, even literate, some of great ability and talent of their own. Missionaries' accounts often repeat that Western art, especially music, had a hypnotic impact on foresters, and the images of saints were viewed as having great powers. Many natives were converted, and a new form of devotion was created, of passionate intensity, laden with mysticism, superstition, and theatricality, which delighted in festive masses, sacred concerts, and mysteries. The Colonial Baroque architecture in the Spanish America is characterized by a profuse decoration (portal of La Profesa Church, Mexico City; façades covered with Puebla-style azulejos, as in the Church of San Francisco Acatepec in San Andrés Cholula and Convent Church of San Francisco, Puebla), which will be exacerbated in the so-called Churrigueresque style (Façade of the Tabernacle of the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral, by Lorenzo Rodríguez; Church of San Francisco Javier, Tepotzotlán; Church of Santa Prisca de Taxco). In Peru, the constructions mostly developed in the cities of Lima, Cusco, Arequipa and Trujillo, since 1650 show original characteristics that are advanced even to the European Baroque, as in the use of cushioned walls and solomonic columns (Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús, Cusco; Basilica and Convent of San Francisco, Lima). Other countries include: the Metropolitan Cathedral of Sucre in Bolivia; Cathedral Basilica of Esquipulas in Guatemala; Tegucigalpa Cathedral in Honduras; León Cathedral in Nicaragua; the Church of la Compañía de Jesús, Quito, Ecuador; the Church of San Ignacio, Bogotá, Colombia; the Caracas Cathedral in Venezuela; the Cabildo of Buenos Aires in Argentina; the Church of Santo Domingo in Santiago, Chile; and Havana Cathedral in Cuba. It is also worth remembering the quality of the churches of the Spanish Jesuit Missions in Bolivia, Spanish Jesuit missions in Paraguay, the Spanish missions in Mexico and the Spanish Franciscan missions in California. In Brazil, as in the metropolis, Portugal, the architecture has a certain Italian influence, usually of a Borrominesque type, as can be seen in the Co-Cathedral of Recife (1784) and Church of Nossa Senhora da Glória do Outeiro in Rio de Janeiro (1739). In the region of Minas Gerais, highlighted the work of Aleijadinho, author of a group of churches that stand out for their curved planimetry, façades with concave-convex dynamic effects and a plastic treatment of all architectural elements (Church of São Francisco de Assis, Ouro Preto, 1765–1788). In the Portuguese colonies of India (Goa, Daman and Diu) an architectural style of Baroque forms mixed with Hindu elements flourished, such as the Se Cathedral and the Basilica of Bom Jesus of Goa, which houses the tomb of St. Francis Xavier. The set of churches and convents of Goa was declared a World Heritage Site in 1986. In the Philippines, which was a Spanish colony for over three centuries, a large number of Baroque constructions are preserved. Four of these as well as the Baroque and Neoclassical city of Vigan are both UNESCO World Heritage Sites; and although they lack formal classification, The Walled City of Manila along with the city of Tayabas both contain a significant extent of Spanish-Baroque-era architecture. As we saw, the Baroque is a Western style, born in Italy. Through the commercial and cultural relationships of Italians with countries of the Balkan Peninsula, including Moldavia and Wallachia, Baroque influences arrive to Eastern Europe. These influences were not very strong, since they usually take place in architecture and stone-sculpted ornaments, and are also mixed intensely with details taken from Byzantine and Islamic art. Before and after the fall of the Byzantine Empire, all the art of Wallachia and Moldavia was primarily influenced by that of Constantinople. Until the end of the 16th century, with little modifications, the plans of churches and monasteries, the murals, and the ornaments carved in stone remain the same as before. From a period starting with the reigns of Matei Basarab (1632–1654) and Vasile Lupu (1634–1653), which coincided with the popularization of Italian Baroque, new ornaments were added, and the style of religious furniture changed. This was not random at all. Decorative elements and principles were brought from Italy, through Venice, or through the Dalmatian regions, and they were adopted by architects and craftsmen from the east. The window and door frames, the pisanie with dedication, the tombstones, the columns and railings, and a part of the bronze, silver or wooden furniture, received a more important role than the one they had before. They existed before too, inspired by the Byzantine tradition, but they gained a more realist look, showing delicate floral motifs. The relief that existed before too, became more accentuated, having volume and consistency. Before this period, reliefs from Wallachia and Moldavia, like the ones from the East, had only two levels, at a small distance one from the other, one at the surface and the other in depth. Big flowers, maybe roses, peonies or thistles, thick leaves, of acanthus or another similar plant, were twisting on columns, or surround door and windows. A place where the Baroque had a strong influence was columns and the railings. Capitals were more decorated than before with foliage. Columns have often twisting shafts, a local reinterpretation of the Solomonic column. Maximalist railings are placed between these columns, decorated with rinceaux. Some of the ones from the Mogoșoaia Palace are also decorated with dolphins. Cartouches are also used sometimes, mostly on tombstones, like on the one of Constantin Brâncoveanu. This movement, is known as the Brâncovenesc style, after Constantin Brâncoveanu, a ruler of Wallachia whose reign (1654–1714) is highly associated with this kind of architecture and design. The style is also present during the 18th century, and in a part of the 19th. Many of the churches and residences erected by boyards and voivodes of these periods are Brâncovenesc. Although Baroque influences can be clearly seen, the Brâncovenesc style takes much more inspiration from the local tradition. As the 18th century passed, with the Phanariot (members of prominent Greek families in Phanar, Istanbul) reigns in Wallachia and Moldavia, Baroque influences come from Istanbul too. They came before too, during the 17th century, but with the Phanariots, more Western Baroque motifs that arrived to the Ottoman Empire had their final destination in present-day Romania. In Moldavia, Baroque elements come from Russia too, where the influence of Italian art was strong. Baroque painters worked deliberately to set themselves apart from the painters of the Renaissance and the Mannerism period after it. In their palette, they used intense and warm colours, and particularly made use of the primary colours red, blue and yellow, frequently",Wiki
Belt_transect,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_transect,"Belt transects are used in biology, more specifically in biostatistics, to estimate the distribution of organisms in relation to a certain area, such as the seashore or a meadow. The belt transect method is similar to the line transect method but gives information on abundance as well as presence, or absence of species. The method involves laying out a transect line and then placing quadrats over the line, starting the quadrat at the first marked point of the line. Any consistent measurement size for the quadrat and length of the line can be chosen, depending on the species. With the quadrats applied, all the individuals of a species can be counted, and the species abundance can be estimated. The method is also suitable for long-term observations with a permanent installation.",Wiki
Biochemistry,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry,"Biochemistry, or biological chemistry, is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms. A sub-discipline of both chemistry and biology, biochemistry may be divided into three fields: structural biology, enzymology, and metabolism. Over the last decades of the 20th century, biochemistry has become successful at explaining living processes through these three disciplines. Almost all areas of the life sciences are being uncovered and developed through biochemical methodology and research. Biochemistry focuses on understanding the chemical basis that allows biological molecules to give rise to the processes that occur within living cells and between cells, in turn relating greatly to the understanding of tissues and organs as well as organism structure and function. Biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology, the study of the molecular mechanisms of biological phenomena. Much of biochemistry deals with the structures, functions, and interactions of biological macromolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. They provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life. The chemistry of the cell also depends upon the reactions of small molecules and ions. These can be inorganic (for example, water and metal ions) or organic (for example, the amino acids, which are used to synthesize proteins). The mechanisms used by cells to harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism. The findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in medicine, nutrition, and agriculture. In medicine, biochemists investigate the causes and cures of diseases. Nutrition studies how to maintain health and wellness and also the effects of nutritional deficiencies. In agriculture, biochemists investigate soil and fertilizers with the goal of improving crop cultivation, crop storage, and pest control. In recent decades, biochemical principles and methods have been combined with problem-solving approaches from engineering to manipulate living systems in order to produce useful tools for research, industrial processes, and diagnosis and control of disease—the discipline of biotechnology. At its most comprehensive definition, biochemistry can be seen as a study of the components and composition of living things and how they come together to become life. In this sense, the history of biochemistry may therefore go back as far as the ancient Greeks. However, biochemistry as a specific scientific discipline began sometime in the 19th century, or a little earlier, depending on which aspect of biochemistry is being focused on. Some argued that the beginning of biochemistry may have been the discovery of the first enzyme, diastase (now called amylase), in 1833 by Anselme Payen, while others considered Eduard Buchner's first demonstration of a complex biochemical process alcoholic fermentation in cell-free extracts in 1897 to be the birth of biochemistry. Some might also point as its beginning to the influential 1842 work by Justus von Liebig, Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its applications to physiology and pathology, which presented a chemical theory of metabolism, or even earlier to the 18th century studies on fermentation and respiration by Antoine Lavoisier. Many other pioneers in the field who helped to uncover the layers of complexity of biochemistry have been proclaimed founders of modern biochemistry. Emil Fischer, who studied the chemistry of proteins, and F. Gowland Hopkins, who studied enzymes and the dynamic nature of biochemistry, represent two examples of early biochemists. The term ""biochemistry"" was first used when Vinzenz Kletzinsky (1826–1882) had his ""Compendium der Biochemie"" printed in Vienna in 1858; it derived from a combination of biology and chemistry. In 1877, Felix Hoppe-Seyler used the term (biochemie in German) as a synonym for physiological chemistry in the foreword to the first issue of Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie (Journal of Physiological Chemistry) where he argued for the setting up of institutes dedicated to this field of study. The German chemist Carl Neuberg however is often cited to have coined the word in 1903, while some credited it to Franz Hofmeister. It was once generally believed that life and its materials had some essential property or substance (often referred to as the ""vital principle"") distinct from any found in non-living matter, and it was thought that only living beings could produce the molecules of life. In 1828, Friedrich Wöhler published a paper on his serendipitous urea synthesis from potassium cyanate and ammonium sulfate; some regarded that as a direct overthrow of vitalism and the establishment of organic chemistry. However, the Wöhler synthesis has sparked controversy as some reject the death of vitalism at his hands. Since then, biochemistry has advanced, especially since the mid-20th century, with the development of new techniques such as chromatography, X-ray diffraction, dual polarisation interferometry, NMR spectroscopy, radioisotopic labeling, electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. These techniques allowed for the discovery and detailed analysis of many molecules and metabolic pathways of the cell, such as glycolysis and the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle), and led to an understanding of biochemistry on a molecular level.[citation needed] Another significant historic event in biochemistry is the discovery of the gene, and its role in the transfer of information in the cell. In the 1950s, James D. Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins were instrumental in solving DNA structure and suggesting its relationship with the genetic transfer of information. In 1958, George Beadle and Edward Tatum received the Nobel Prize for work in fungi showing that one gene produces one enzyme. In 1988, Colin Pitchfork was the first person convicted of murder with DNA evidence, which led to the growth of forensic science. More recently, Andrew Z. Fire and Craig C. Mello received the 2006 Nobel Prize for discovering the role of RNA interference (RNAi) in the silencing of gene expression. Around two dozen chemical elements are essential to various kinds of biological life. Most rare elements on Earth are not needed by life (exceptions being selenium and iodine), while a few common ones (aluminum and titanium) are not used. Most organisms share element needs, but there are a few differences between plants and animals. For example, ocean algae use bromine, but land plants and animals do not seem to need any. All animals require sodium, but is not an essential element for plants. Plants need boron and silicon, but animals may not (or may need ultra-small amounts).[citation needed] Just six elements—carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, calcium and phosphorus—make up almost 99% of the mass of living cells, including those in the human body (see composition of the human body for a complete list). In addition to the six major elements that compose most of the human body, humans require smaller amounts of possibly 18 more. The 4 main classes of molecules in biochemistry (often called biomolecules) are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Many biological molecules are polymers: in this terminology, monomers are relatively small macromolecules that are linked together to create large macromolecules known as polymers. When monomers are linked together to synthesize a biological polymer, they undergo a process called dehydration synthesis. Different macromolecules can assemble in larger complexes, often needed for biological activity. Two of the main functions of carbohydrates are energy storage and providing structure. One of the common sugars known as glucose is a carbohydrate, but not all carbohydrates are sugars. There are more carbohydrates on Earth than any other known type of biomolecule; they are used to store energy and genetic information, as well as play important roles in cell to cell interactions and communications.[citation needed] The simplest type of carbohydrate is a monosaccharide, which among other properties contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, mostly in a ratio of 1:2:1 (generalized formula CnH2nOn, where n is at least 3). Glucose (C6H12O6) is one of the most important carbohydrates; others include fructose (C6H12O6), the sugar commonly associated with the sweet taste of fruits,[a] and deoxyribose (C5H10O4), a component of DNA. A monosaccharide can switch between acyclic (open-chain) form and a cyclic form. The open-chain form can be turned into a ring of carbon atoms bridged by an oxygen atom created from the carbonyl group of one end and the hydroxyl group of another. The cyclic molecule has a hemiacetal or hemiketal group, depending on whether the linear form was an aldose or a ketose. In these cyclic forms, the ring usually has 5 or 6 atoms. These forms are called furanoses and pyranoses, respectively—by analogy with furan and pyran, the simplest compounds with the same carbon-oxygen ring (although they lack the carbon-carbon double bonds of these two molecules). For example, the aldohexose glucose may form a hemiacetal linkage between the hydroxyl on carbon 1 and the oxygen on carbon 4, yielding a molecule with a 5-membered ring, called glucofuranose. The same reaction can take place between carbons 1 and 5 to form a molecule with a 6-membered ring, called glucopyranose. Cyclic forms with a 7-atom ring called heptoses are rare.[citation needed] Two monosaccharides can be joined by a glycosidic or ester bond into a disaccharide through a dehydration reaction during which a molecule of water is released. The reverse reaction in which the glycosidic bond of a disaccharide is broken into two monosaccharides is termed hydrolysis. The best-known disaccharide is sucrose or ordinary sugar, which consists of a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule joined. Another important disaccharide is lactose found in milk, consisting of a glucose molecule and a galactose molecule. Lactose may be hydrolysed by lactase, and deficiency in this enzyme results in lactose intolerance. When a few (around three to six) monosaccharides are joined, it is called an oligosaccharide (oligo- meaning ""few""). These molecules tend to be used as markers and signals, as well as having some other uses. Many monosaccharides joined form a polysaccharide. They can be joined in one long linear chain, or they may be branched. Two of the most common polysaccharides are cellulose and glycogen, both consisting of repeating glucose monomers. Cellulose is an important structural component of plant's cell walls and glycogen is used as a form of energy storage in animals. Sugar can be characterized by having reducing or non-reducing ends. A reducing end of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the open-chain aldehyde (aldose) or keto form (ketose). If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free hydroxy group of the pyranose or furanose form is exchanged with an OH-side-chain of another sugar, yielding a full acetal. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety forms a full acetal with the C4-OH group of glucose. Saccharose does not have a reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2). Lipids comprise a diverse range of molecules and to some extent is a catchall for relatively water-insoluble or nonpolar compounds of biological origin, including waxes, fatty acids, fatty-acid derived phospholipids, sphingolipids, glycolipids, and terpenoids (e.g., retinoids and steroids). Some lipids are linear, open-chain aliphatic molecules, while others have ring structures. Some are aromatic (with a cyclic [ring] and planar [flat] structure) while others are not. Some are flexible, while others are rigid. Lipids are usually made from one molecule of glycerol combined with other molecules. In triglycerides, the main group of bulk lipids, there is one molecule of glycerol and three fatty acids. Fatty acids are considered the monomer in that case, and may be saturated (no double bonds in the carbon chain) or unsaturated (one or more double bonds in the carbon chain).[citation needed] Most lipids have some polar character and are largely nonpolar. In general, the bulk of their structure is nonpolar or hydrophobic (""water-fearing""), meaning that it does not interact well with polar solvents like water. Another part of their structure is polar or hydrophilic (""water-loving"") and will tend to associate with polar solvents like water. This makes them amphiphilic molecules (having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions). In the case of cholesterol, the polar group is a mere –OH (hydroxyl or alcohol). [citation needed] In the case of phospholipids, the polar groups are considerably larger and more polar, as described below. Lipids are an integral part of our daily diet. Most oils and milk products that we use for cooking and eating like butter, cheese, ghee etc. are composed of fats. Vegetable oils are rich in various polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Lipid-containing foods undergo digestion within the body and are broken into fatty acids and glycerol, the final degradation products of fats and lipids. Lipids, especially phospholipids, are also used in various pharmaceutical products, either as co-solubilizers (e.g. in parenteral infusions) or else as drug carrier components (e.g. in a liposome or transfersome). Proteins are very large molecules—macro-biopolymers—made from monomers called amino acids. An amino acid consists of an alpha carbon atom attached to an amino group, –NH2, a carboxylic acid group, –COOH (although these exist as –NH3+ and –COO− under physiologic conditions), a simple hydrogen atom, and a side chain commonly denoted as ""–R"". The side chain ""R"" is different for each amino acid of which there are 20 standard ones. It is this ""R"" group that makes each amino acid different, and the properties of the side chains greatly influence the overall three-dimensional conformation of a protein. Some amino acids have functions by themselves or in a modified form; for instance, glutamate functions as an important neurotransmitter. Amino acids can be joined via a peptide bond. In this dehydration synthesis, a water molecule is removed and the peptide bond connects the nitrogen of one amino acid's amino group to the carbon of the other's carboxylic acid group. The resulting molecule is called a dipeptide, and short stretches of amino acids (usually, fewer than thirty) are called peptides or polypeptides. Longer stretches merit the title proteins. As an example, the important blood serum protein albumin contains 585 amino acid residues. Proteins can have structural and/or functional roles. For instance, movements of the proteins actin and myosin ultimately are responsible for the contraction of skeletal muscle. One property many proteins have is that they specifically bind to a certain molecule or class of molecules—they may be extremely selective in what they bind. Antibodies are an example of proteins that attach to one specific type of molecule. Antibodies are composed of heavy and light chains. Two heavy chains would be linked to two light chains through disulfide linkages between their amino acids. Antibodies are specific through variation based on differences in the N-terminal domain. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which uses antibodies, is one of the most sensitive tests modern medicine uses to detect various biomolecules. Probably the most important proteins, however, are the enzymes. Virtually every reaction in a living cell requires an enzyme to lower the activation energy of the reaction. These molecules recognize specific reactant molecules called substrates; they then catalyze the reaction between them. By lowering the activation energy, the enzyme speeds up that reaction by a rate of 1011 or more; a reaction that would normally take over 3,000 years to complete spontaneously might take less than a second with an enzyme. The enzyme itself is not used up in the process and is free to catalyze the same reaction with a new set of substrates. Using various modifiers, the activity of the enzyme can be regulated, enabling control of the biochemistry of the cell as a whole. The structure of proteins is traditionally described in a hierarchy of four levels. The primary structure of a protein consists of its linear sequence of amino acids; for instance, ""alanine-glycine-tryptophan-serine-glutamate-asparagine-glycine-lysine-..."". Secondary structure is concerned with local morphology (morphology being the study of structure). Some combinations of amino acids will tend to curl up in a coil called an α-helix or into a sheet called a β-sheet; some α-helixes can be seen in the hemoglobin schematic above. Tertiary structure is the entire three-dimensional shape of the protein. This shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids. In fact, a single change can change the entire structure. The alpha chain of hemoglobin contains 146 amino acid residues; substitution of the glutamate residue at position 6 with a valine residue changes the behavior of hemoglobin so much that it results in sickle-cell disease. Finally, quaternary structure is concerned with the structure of a protein with multiple peptide subunits, like hemoglobin with its four subunits. Not all proteins have more than one subunit. Ingested proteins are usually broken up into single amino acids or dipeptides in the small intestine and then absorbed. They can then be joined to form new proteins. Intermediate products of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway can be used to form all twenty amino acids, and most bacteria and plants possess all the necessary enzymes to synthesize them. Humans and other mammals, however, can synthesize only half of them. They cannot synthesize isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Because they must be ingested, these are the essential amino acids. Mammals do possess the enzymes to synthesize alanine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, and tyrosine, the nonessential amino acids. While they can synthesize arginine and histidine, they cannot produce it in sufficient amounts for young, growing animals, and so these are often considered essential amino acids. If the amino group is removed from an amino acid, it leaves behind a carbon skeleton called an α-keto acid. Enzymes called transaminases can easily transfer the amino group from one amino acid (making it an α-keto acid) to another α-keto acid (making it an amino acid). This is important in the biosynthesis of amino acids, as for many of the pathways, intermediates from other biochemical pathways are converted to the α-keto acid skeleton, and then an amino group is added, often via transamination. The amino acids may then be linked together to form a protein. A similar process is used to break down proteins. It is first hydrolyzed into its component amino acids. Free ammonia (NH3), existing as the ammonium ion (NH4+) in blood, is toxic to life forms. A suitable method for excreting it must therefore exist. Different tactics have evolved in different animals, depending on the animals' needs. Unicellular organisms release the ammonia into the environment. Likewise, bony fish can release ammonia into the water where it is quickly diluted. In general, mammals convert ammonia into urea, via the urea cycle. In order to determine whether two proteins are related, or in other words to decide whether they are homologous or not, scientists use sequence-comparison methods. Methods like sequence alignments and structural alignments are powerful tools that help scientists identify homologies between related molecules. The relevance of finding homologies among proteins goes beyond forming an evolutionary pattern of protein families. By finding how similar two protein sequences are, we acquire knowledge about their structure and therefore their function. Nucleic acids, so-called because of their prevalence in cellular nuclei, is the generic name of the family of biopolymers. They are complex, high-molecular-weight biochemical macromolecules that can convey genetic information in all living cells and viruses. The monomers are called nucleotides, and each consists of three components: a nitrogenous heterocyclic base (either a purine or a pyrimidine), a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group. The most common nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). The phosphate group and the sugar of each nucleotide bond with each other to form the backbone of the nucleic acid, while the sequence of nitrogenous bases stores the information. The most common nitrogenous bases are adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. The nitrogenous bases of each strand of a nucleic acid will form hydrogen bonds with certain other nitrogenous bases in a complementary strand of nucleic acid. Adenine binds with thymine and uracil, thymine binds only with adenine, and cytosine and guanine can bind only with one another. Adenine, thymine, and uracil contain two hydrogen bonds, while hydrogen bonds formed between cytosine and guanine are three. Aside from the genetic material of the cell, nucleic acids often play a role as second messengers, as well as forming the base molecule for adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy-carrier molecule found in all living organisms. Also, the nitrogenous bases possible in the two nucleic acids are different: adenine, cytosine, and guanine occur in both RNA and DNA, while thymine occurs only in DNA and uracil occurs in RNA. Glucose is an energy source in most life forms. For instance, polysaccharides are broken down into their monomers by enzymes (glycogen phosphorylase removes glucose residues from glycogen, a polysaccharide). Disaccharides like lactose or sucrose are cleaved into their two component monosaccharides. Glucose is mainly metabolized by a very important ten-step pathway called glycolysis, the net result of which is to break down one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. This also produces a net two molecules of ATP, the energy currency of cells, along with two reducing equivalents of converting NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: oxidized form) to NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: reduced form). This does not require oxygen; if no oxygen is available (or the cell cannot use oxygen), the NAD is restored by converting the pyruvate to lactate (lactic acid) (e.g. in humans) or to ethanol plus carbon dioxide (e.g. in yeast). Other monosaccharides like galactose and fructose can be converted into intermediates of the glycolytic pathway. In aerobic cells with sufficient oxygen, as in most human cells, the pyruvate is further metabolized. It is irreversibly converted to acetyl-CoA, giving off one carbon atom as the waste product carbon dioxide, generating another reducing equivalent as NADH. The two molecules acetyl-CoA (from one molecule of glucose) then enter the citric acid cycle, producing two molecules of ATP, six more NADH molecules and two reduced (ubi)quinones (via FADH2 as enzyme-bound cofactor), and releasing the remaining carbon atoms as carbon dioxide. The produced NADH and quinol molecules then feed into the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain, an electron transport system transferring the electrons ultimately to oxygen and conserving the released energy in the form of a proton gradient over a membrane (inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes). Thus, oxygen is reduced to water and the original electron acceptors NAD+ and quinone are regenerated. This is why humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. The energy released from transferring the electrons from high-energy states in NADH and quinol is conserved first as proton gradient and converted to ATP via ATP synthase. This generates an additional 28 molecules of ATP (24 from the 8 NADH + 4 from the 2 quinols), totaling to 32 molecules of ATP conserved per degraded glucose (two from glycolysis + two from the citrate cycle). It is clear that using oxygen to completely oxidize glucose provides an organism with far more energy than any oxygen-independent metabolic feature, and this is thought to be the reason why complex life appeared only after Earth's atmosphere accumulated large amounts of oxygen. In vertebrates, vigorously contracting skeletal muscles (during weightlifting or sprinting, for example) do not receive enough oxygen to meet the energy demand, and so they shift to anaerobic metabolism, converting glucose to lactate. The combination of glucose from noncarbohydrates origin, such as fat and proteins. This only happens when glycogen supplies in the liver are worn out. The pathway is a crucial reversal of glycolysis from pyruvate to glucose and can use many sources like amino acids, glycerol and Krebs Cycle. Large scale protein and fat catabolism usually occur when those suffer from starvation or certain endocrine disorders. The liver regenerates the glucose, using a process called gluconeogenesis. This process is not quite the opposite of glycolysis, and actually requires three times the amount of energy gained from glycolysis (six molecules of ATP are used, compared to the two gained in glycolysis). Analogous to the above reactions, the glucose produced can then undergo glycolysis in tissues that need energy, be stored as glycogen (or starch in plants), or be converted to other monosaccharides or joined into di- or oligosaccharides. The combined pathways of glycolysis during exercise, lactate's crossing via the bloodstream to the liver, subsequent gluconeogenesis and release of glucose into the bloodstream is called the Cori cycle. Researchers in biochemistry use specific techniques native to biochemistry, but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas developed in the fields of genetics, molecular biology, and biophysics. There is not a defined line between these disciplines. Biochemistry studies the chemistry required for biological activity of molecules, molecular biology studies their biological activity, genetics studies their heredity, which happens to be carried by their genome. This is shown in the following schematic that depicts one possible view of the relationships between the fields:",Wiki
Biocoenosis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocoenosis,"A biocenosis (UK English, biocoenosis, also biocenose, biocoenose, biotic community, biological community, ecological community, life assemblage), coined by Karl Möbius in 1877, describes the interacting organisms living together in a habitat (biotope). The use of this term has declined in the 21st сentury. In the palaeontological literature, the term distinguishes ""life assemblages"", which reflect the original living community, living together at one place and time. In other words, it is an assemblage of fossils or a community of specific time, which is different from ""death assemblages"" (thanatocoenoses). No palaeontological assemblage will ever completely represent the original biological community (i.e. the biocoenosis, in the sense used by an ecologist); the term thus has somewhat different meanings in a palaeontological and an ecological context. Based on the concept of biocenosis, ecological communities can take various forms: The geographical extent of a biocenose is limited by the requirement of a more or less uniform species composition. An ecosystem, originally defined by Tansley (1935), is a biotic community (or biocenosis) along with its physical environment (or biotope). In ecological studies, biocenosis is the emphasis on relationships between species in an area. These relationships are an additional consideration to the interaction of each species with the physical environment. Biotic communities vary in size, and larger ones may contain smaller ones. Species interactions are evident in food or feeding relationships. A method of delineating biotic communities is to map the food network to identify which species feed upon which others and then determine the system boundary as the one that can be drawn through the fewest consumption links relative to the number of species within the boundary. Mapping biotic communities is important identifying sites needing environmental protection, such as the British Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). The Australian Department of the Environment and Heritage maintains a register of Threatened Species and Threatened Ecological Communities under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).",Wiki
Biodiversity,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity,"Biodiversity is the variability of life on Earth. It can be measured on various levels. There is for example genetic variability, species diversity, ecosystem diversity and phylogenetic diversity. Diversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is greater in the tropics as a result of the warm climate and high primary productivity in the region near the equator. Tropical forest ecosystems cover less than one-fifth of Earth's terrestrial area and contain about 50% of the world's species. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity for both marine and terrestrial taxa. Since life began on Earth, six major mass extinctions and several minor events have led to large and sudden drops in biodiversity. The Phanerozoic aeon (the last 540 million years) marked a rapid growth in biodiversity via the Cambrian explosion. In this period, the majority of multicellular phyla first appeared. The next 400 million years included repeated, massive biodiversity losses. Those events have been classified as mass extinction events. In the Carboniferous, rainforest collapse may have led to a great loss of plant and animal life. The Permian–Triassic extinction event, 251 million years ago, was the worst; vertebrate recovery took 30 million years. Human activities have led to an ongoing biodiversity loss and an accompanying loss of genetic diversity. This process is often referred to as Holocene extinction, or sixth mass extinction. For example, it was estimated in 2007 that up to 30% of all species will be extinct by 2050. Destroying habitats for farming is a key reason why biodiversity is decreasing today. Climate change also plays a role. This can be seen for example in the effects of climate change on biomes. This anthropogenic extinction may have started toward the end of the Pleistocene, as some studies suggest that the megafaunal extinction event that took place around the end of the last ice age partly resulted from overhunting. Biologists most often define biodiversity as the ""totality of genes, species and ecosystems of a region"". An advantage of this definition is that it presents a unified view of the traditional types of biological variety previously identified: Biodiversity is most commonly used to replace the more clearly-defined and long-established terms, species diversity and species richness. However, there is no concrete definition for biodiversity, as its definition continues to be reimagined and redefined. To give a couple examples, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) defined biodiversity in 2019 as ""the variability that exists among living organisms (both within and between species) and the ecosystems of which they are part."" The World Health Organization updated their website’s definition of biodiversity to be the “variability among living organisms from all sources.” Both these definitions, although broad, give a current understanding of what is meant by the term biodiversity. According to estimates by Mora et al. (2011), there are approximately 8.7 million terrestrial species and 2.2 million oceanic species. The authors note that these estimates are strongest for eukaryotic organisms and likely represent the lower bound of prokaryote diversity. Other estimates include: Since the rate of extinction has increased, many extant species may become extinct before they are described. Not surprisingly, in the animalia the most studied groups are birds and mammals, whereas fishes and arthropods are the least studied animals groups. During the last century, decreases in biodiversity have been increasingly observed. It was estimated in 2007 that up to 30% of all species will be extinct by 2050. Of these, about one eighth of known plant species are threatened with extinction. Estimates reach as high as 140,000 species per year (based on Species-area theory). This figure indicates unsustainable ecological practices, because few species emerge each year. The rate of species loss is greater now than at any time in human history, with extinctions occurring at rates hundreds of times higher than background extinction rates. and expected to still grow in the upcoming years. As of 2012, some studies suggest that 25% of all mammal species could be extinct in 20 years. In absolute terms, the planet has lost 58% of its biodiversity since 1970 according to a 2016 study by the World Wildlife Fund. The Living Planet Report 2014 claims that ""the number of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish across the globe is, on average, about half the size it was 40 years ago"". Of that number, 39% accounts for the terrestrial wildlife gone, 39% for the marine wildlife gone and 76% for the freshwater wildlife gone. Biodiversity took the biggest hit in Latin America, plummeting 83 percent. High-income countries showed a 10% increase in biodiversity, which was canceled out by a loss in low-income countries. This is despite the fact that high-income countries use five times the ecological resources of low-income countries, which was explained as a result of a process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing resource depletion to poorer nations, which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses. A 2017 study published in PLOS One found that the biomass of insect life in Germany had declined by three-quarters in the last 25 years. Dave Goulson of Sussex University stated that their study suggested that humans ""appear to be making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life, and are currently on course for ecological Armageddon. If we lose the insects then everything is going to collapse."" In 2020 the World Wildlife Foundation published a report saying that ""biodiversity is being destroyed at a rate unprecedented in human history"". The report claims that 68% of the population of the examined species were destroyed in the years 1970 – 2016. Of 70,000 monitored species, around 48% are experiencing population declines from human activity (in 2023), whereas only 3% have increasing populations. Rates of decline in biodiversity in the current sixth mass extinction match or exceed rates of loss in the five previous mass extinction events in the fossil record. Biodiversity loss is in fact ""one of the most critical manifestations of the Anthropocene"" (since around the 1950s); the continued decline of biodiversity constitutes ""an unprecedented threat"" to the continued existence of human civilization. The reduction is caused primarily by human impacts, particularly habitat destruction. Since the Stone Age, species loss has accelerated above the average basal rate, driven by human activity. Estimates of species losses are at a rate 100–10,000 times as fast as is typical in the fossil record. Loss of biodiversity results in the loss of natural capital that supplies ecosystem goods and services. Species today are being wiped out at a rate 100 to 1,000 times higher than baseline, and the rate of extinctions is increasing. This process destroys the resilience and adaptability of life on Earth. In 2006, many species were formally classified as rare or endangered or threatened; moreover, scientists have estimated that millions more species are at risk which have not been formally recognized. About 40 percent of the 40,177 species assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria are now listed as threatened with extinction—a total of 16,119. As of late 2022 9251 species were considered part of the IUCN's critically endangered. Numerous scientists and the IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services assert that human population growth and overconsumption are the primary factors in this decline. However, other scientists have criticized this finding and say that loss of habitat caused by ""the growth of commodities for export"" is the main driver. A 2025 study found that human activities are responsible for biodiversity loss across all species and ecosystems. Some studies have however pointed out that habitat destruction for the expansion of agriculture and the overexploitation of wildlife are the more significant drivers of contemporary biodiversity loss, not climate change. Biodiversity is not evenly distributed, rather it varies greatly across the globe as well as within regions and seasons. Among other factors, the diversity of all living things (biota) depends on temperature, precipitation, altitude, soils, geography and the interactions between other species. The study of the spatial distribution of organisms, species and ecosystems, is the science of biogeography. Diversity consistently measures higher in the tropics and in other localized regions such as the Cape Floristic Region and lower in polar regions generally. Rain forests that have had wet climates for a long time, such as Yasuní National Park in Ecuador, have particularly high biodiversity. There is local biodiversity, which directly impacts daily life, affecting the availability of fresh water, food choices, and fuel sources for humans. Regional biodiversity includes habitats and ecosystems that synergizes and either overlaps or differs on a regional scale. National biodiversity within a country determines the ability for a country to thrive according to its habitats and ecosystems on a national scale. Also, within a country, endangered species are initially supported on a national level then internationally. Ecotourism may be utilized to support the economy and encourages tourists to continue to visit and support species and ecosystems they visit, while they enjoy the available amenities provided. International biodiversity impacts global livelihood, food systems, and health. Problematic pollution, over consumption, and climate change can devastate international biodiversity. Nature-based solutions are a critical tool for a global resolution. Many species are in danger of becoming extinct and need world leaders to be proactive with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Terrestrial biodiversity is thought to be up to 25 times greater than ocean biodiversity. Forests harbour most of Earth's terrestrial biodiversity. The conservation of the world's biodiversity is thus utterly dependent on the way in which we interact with and use the world's forests. A new method used in 2011, put the total number of species on Earth at 8.7 million, of which 2.1 million were estimated to live in the ocean. However, this estimate seems to under-represent the diversity of microorganisms. Forests provide habitats for 80 percent of amphibian species, 75 percent of bird species and 68 percent of mammal species. About 60 percent of all vascular plants are found in tropical forests. Mangroves provide breeding grounds and nurseries for numerous species of fish and shellfish and help trap sediments that might otherwise adversely affect seagrass beds and coral reefs, which are habitats for many more marine species. Forests span around 4 billion acres (nearly a third of the Earth's land mass) and are home to approximately 80% of the world's biodiversity. About 1 billion hectares are covered by primary forests. Over 700 million hectares of the world's woods are officially protected. The biodiversity of forests varies considerably according to factors such as forest type, geography, climate and soils – in addition to human use. Most forest habitats in temperate regions support relatively few animal and plant species and species that tend to have large geographical distributions, while the montane forests of Africa, South America and Southeast Asia and lowland forests of Australia, coastal Brazil, the Caribbean islands, Central America and insular Southeast Asia have many species with small geographical distributions. Areas with dense human populations and intense agricultural land use, such as Europe, parts of Bangladesh, China, India and North America, are less intact in terms of their biodiversity. Northern Africa, southern Australia, coastal Brazil, Madagascar and South Africa, are also identified as areas with striking losses in biodiversity intactness. European forests in EU and non-EU nations comprise more than 30% of Europe's land mass (around 227 million hectares), representing an almost 10% growth since 1990. Generally, there is an increase in biodiversity from the poles to the tropics. Thus localities at lower latitudes have more species than localities at higher latitudes. This is often referred to as the latitudinal gradient in species diversity. Several ecological factors may contribute to the gradient, but the ultimate factor behind many of them is the greater mean temperature at the equator compared to that at the poles. Even though terrestrial biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles, some studies claim that this characteristic is unverified in aquatic ecosystems, especially in marine ecosystems. The latitudinal distribution of parasites does not appear to follow this rule. Also, in terrestrial ecosystems the soil bacterial diversity has been shown to be highest in temperate climatic zones, and has been attributed to carbon inputs and habitat connectivity. In 2016, an alternative hypothesis (""the fractal biodiversity"") was proposed to explain the biodiversity latitudinal gradient. In this study, the species pool size and the fractal nature of ecosystems were combined to clarify some general patterns of this gradient. This hypothesis considers temperature, moisture, and net primary production (NPP) as the main variables of an ecosystem niche and as the axis of the ecological hypervolume. In this way, it is possible to build fractal hyper volumes, whose fractal dimension rises to three moving towards the equator. A biodiversity hotspot is a region with a high level of endemic species that have experienced great habitat loss. The term hotspot was introduced in 1988 by Norman Myers. While hotspots are spread all over the world, the majority are forest areas and most are located in the tropics. Brazil's Atlantic Forest is considered one such hotspot, containing roughly 20,000 plant species, 1,350 vertebrates and millions of insects, about half of which occur nowhere else. The island of Madagascar and India are also particularly notable. Colombia is characterized by high biodiversity, with the highest rate of species by area unit worldwide and it has the largest number of endemics (species that are not found naturally anywhere else) of any country. About 10% of the species of the Earth can be found in Colombia, including over 1,900 species of bird, more than in Europe and North America combined, Colombia has 10% of the world's mammals species, 14% of the amphibian species and 18% of the bird species of the world. Madagascar dry deciduous forests and lowland rainforests possess a high ratio of endemism. Since the island separated from mainland Africa 66 million years ago, many species and ecosystems have evolved independently. Indonesia's 17,000 islands cover 735,355 square miles (1,904,560 km2) and contain 10% of the world's flowering plants, 12% of mammals and 17% of reptiles, amphibians and birds—along with nearly 240 million people. Many regions of high biodiversity and/or endemism arise from specialized habitats which require unusual adaptations, for example, alpine environments in high mountains, or Northern European peat bogs. Accurately measuring differences in biodiversity can be difficult. Selection bias amongst researchers may contribute to biased empirical research for modern estimates of biodiversity. In 1768, Rev. Gilbert White succinctly observed of his Selborne, Hampshire ""all nature is so full, that that district produces the most variety which is the most examined."" Biodiversity is the result of 3.5 billion years of evolution. The origin of life has not been established by science, however, some evidence suggests that life may already have been well-established only a few hundred million years after the formation of the Earth. Until approximately 2.5 billion years ago, all life consisted of microorganisms – archaea, bacteria, and single-celled protozoans and protists. Biodiversity grew fast during the Phanerozoic (the last 540 million years), especially during the so-called Cambrian explosion—a period during which nearly every phylum of multicellular organisms first appeared. However, recent studies suggest that this diversification had started earlier, at least in the Ediacaran, and that it continued in the Ordovician. Over the next 400 million years or so, invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend. This dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic, massive losses of diversity classified as mass extinction events. A significant loss occurred in anamniotic limbed vertebrates when rainforests collapsed in the Carboniferous, but amniotes seem to have been little affected by this event; their diversification slowed down later, around the Asselian/Sakmarian boundary, in the early Cisuralian (Early Permian), about 293 Ma ago. The worst was the Permian-Triassic extinction event, 251 million years ago. Vertebrates took 30 million years to recover from this event. The most recent major mass extinction event, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, occurred 66 million years ago. This period has attracted more attention than others because it resulted in the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, which were represented by many lineages at the end of the Maastrichtian, just before that extinction event. However, many other taxa were affected by this crisis, which affected even marine taxa, such as ammonites, which also became extinct around that time. The biodiversity of the past is called Paleobiodiversity. The fossil record suggests that the last few million years featured the greatest biodiversity in history. However, not all scientists support this view, since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent geologic sections. Some scientists believe that corrected for sampling artifacts, modern biodiversity may not be much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago, whereas others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective of the diversification of life. Estimates of the present global macroscopic species diversity vary from 2 million to 100 million, with a best estimate of somewhere near 9 million, the vast majority arthropods. Diversity appears to increase continually in the absence of natural selection. The existence of a global carrying capacity, limiting the amount of life that can live at once, is debated, as is the question of whether such a limit would also cap the number of species. While records of life in the sea show a logistic pattern of growth, life on land (insects, plants and tetrapods) shows an exponential rise in diversity. As one author states, ""Tetrapods have not yet invaded 64 percent of potentially habitable modes and it could be that without human influence the ecological and taxonomic diversity of tetrapods would continue to increase exponentially until most or all of the available eco-space is filled."" It also appears that the diversity continues to increase over time, especially after mass extinctions. On the other hand, changes through the Phanerozoic correlate much better with the hyperbolic model (widely used in population biology, demography and macrosociology, as well as fossil biodiversity) than with exponential and logistic models. The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order positive feedback (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a negative feedback arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. Differences in the strength of the second-order feedback due to different intensities of interspecific competition might explain the faster rediversification of ammonoids in comparison to bivalves after the end-Permian extinction. The hyperbolic pattern of the world population growth arises from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth. The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between diversity and community structure complexity. The similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and stochastic dynamics. Most biologists agree however that the period since human emergence is part of a new mass extinction, named the Holocene extinction event, caused primarily by the impact humans are having on the environment. It has been argued that the present rate of extinction is sufficient to eliminate most species on the planet Earth within 100 years. New species are regularly discovered (on average between 5–10,000 new species each year, most of them insects) and many, though discovered, are not yet classified (estimates are that nearly 90% of all arthropods are not yet classified). Most of the terrestrial diversity is found in tropical forests and in general, the land has more species than the ocean; some 8.7 million species may exist on Earth, of which some 2.1 million live in the ocean. It is estimated that 5 to 50 billion species have existed on the planet. Assuming that there may be a maximum of about 50 million species currently alive, it stands to reason that greater than 99% of the planet's species went extinct prior to the evolution of humans. Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86% have not yet been described. However, a May 2016 scientific report estimates that 1 trillion species are currently on Earth, with only one-thousandth of one percent described. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as four trillion tons of carbon. In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms living on Earth. The age of Earth is about 4.54 billion years. The earliest undisputed evidence of life dates at least from 3.7 billion years ago, during the Eoarchean era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean eon. There are microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old meta-sedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland.. More recently, in 2015, ""remains of biotic life"" were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia. According to one of the researchers, ""If life arose relatively quickly on Earth...then it could be common in the universe."" There have been many claims about biodiversity's effect on the ecosystem services, especially provisioning and regulating services. Some of those claims have been validated, some are incorrect and some lack enough evidence to draw definitive conclusions. Ecosystem services have been grouped in three types: Experiments with controlled environments have shown that humans cannot easily build ecosystems to support human needs; for example insect pollination cannot be mimicked, though there have been attempts to create artificial pollinators using unmanned aerial vehicles. The economic activity of pollination alone represented between $2.1–14.6 billion in 2003. Other sources have reported somewhat conflicting results and in 1997 Robert Costanza and his colleagues reported the estimated global value of ecosystem services (not captured in traditional markets) at an average of $33 trillion annually. With regards to provisioning services, greater species diversity has the following benefits: With regards to regulating services, greater species diversity has the following benefits: Greater species diversity Agricultural diversity can be divided into two categories: intraspecific diversity, which includes the genetic variation within a single species, like the potato (Solanum tuberosum) that is composed of many different forms and types (e.g. in the U.S. they might compare russet potatoes with new potatoes or purple potatoes, all different, but all part of the same species, S. tuberosum). The other category of agricultural diversity is called interspecific diversity and refers to the number and types of different species. Agricultural diversity can also be divided by whether it is 'planned' diversity or 'associated' diversity. This is a functional classification that we impose and not an intrinsic feature of life or diversity. Planned diversity includes the crops which a farmer has encouraged, planted or raised (e.g. crops, covers, symbionts, and livestock, among others), which can be contrasted with the associated diversity that arrives among the crops, uninvited (e.g. herbivores, weed species and pathogens, among others). Associated biodiversity can be damaging or beneficial. The beneficial associated biodiversity include for instance wild pollinators such as wild bees and syrphid flies that pollinate crops and natural enemies and antagonists to pests and pathogens. Beneficial associated biodiversity occurs abundantly in crop fields and provide multiple ecosystem services such as pest control, nutrient cycling and pollination that support crop production. Although about 80 percent of humans' food supply comes from just 20 kinds of plants, humans use at least 40,000 species. Earth's surviving biodiversity provides resources for increasing the range of food and other products suitable for human use, although the present extinction rate shrinks that potential. Biodiversity's relevance to human health is becoming an international political issue, as scientific evidence builds on the global health implications of biodiversity loss. This issue is closely linked with the issue of climate change, as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.). This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future (ACSF) at Cornell University. Some of the health issues influenced by biodiversity include dietary health and nutrition security, infectious disease, medical science and medicinal resources, social and psychological health. Biodiversity is also known to have an important role in reducing disaster risk and in post-disaster relief and recovery efforts. Biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources. A significant proportion of drugs are derived, directly or indirectly, from biological sources: at least 50% of the pharmaceutical compounds on the US market are derived from plants, animals and microorganisms, while about 80% of the world population depends on medicines from nature (used in either modern or traditional medical practice) for primary healthcare. Only a tiny fraction of wild species has been investigated for medical potential. Marine ecosystems are particularly important, although inappropriate bioprospecting can increase biodiversity loss, as well as violating the laws of the communities and states from which the resources are taken. According to the Boston Consulting Group, the economic value that biodiversity has on society comes down to four definable terms: regulation, culture, habitat, and provisioning. To sum these up in a relatively short manner, biodiversity helps maintain habitat and animal functions that provide considerable amounts of resources that benefit the economy. Biodiversity’s economic resources are worth at around $150 trillion annually which is roughly twice the world’s GDP. The loss of biodiversity is actually harming the GDP of the world by costing an estimated $5 trillion annually. Business supply chains rely heavily on ecosystems remaining relatively maintained and nurtured. A disruption to these supply chains would negatively impact many businesses that would end up costing them more than what they are gaining. Philosophically it could be argued that biodiversity has intrinsic aesthetic and spiritual value to mankind in and of itself. This idea can be used as a counterweight to the notion that tropical forests and other ecological realms are only worthy of conservation because of the services they provide. Biodiversity also affords many non-material benefits including spiritual and aesthetic values, knowledge systems and education. Less than 1% of all species that have been described have been studied beyond noting their existence. The vast majority of Earth's species are microbial. Contemporary biodiversity physics is ""firmly fixated on the visible [macroscopic] world"". For example, microbial life is metabolically and environmentally more diverse than multicellular life (see e.g., extremophile). ""On the tree of life, based on analyses of small-subunit ribosomal RNA, visible life consists of barely noticeable twigs. The inverse relationship of size and population recurs higher on the evolutionary ladder—to a first approximation, all multicellular species on Earth are insects"". Insect extinction rates are high—supporting the Holocene extinction hypothesis. Biodiversity naturally varies due to seasonal shifts. Spring's arrival enhances biodiversity as numerous species breed and feed, while winter's onset temporarily reduces it as some insects perish and migrating animals leave. Additionally, the seasonal fluctuation in plant and invertebrate populations influences biodiversity. Barriers such as large rivers, seas, oceans, mountains and deserts encourage diversity by enabling independent evolution on either side of the barrier, via the process of allopatric speciation. The term invasive species is applied to species that breach the natural barriers that would normally keep them constrained. Without barriers, such species occupy new territory, often supplanting native species by occupying their niches, or by using resources that would normally sustain native species. Species are increasingly being moved by humans (on purpose and accidentally). Some studies say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals. Many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives, but not extinctions. Invasive species seem to increase local (alpha diversity) diversity, which decreases turnover of diversity (beta diversity). Overall gamma diversity may be lowered because species are going extinct because of other causes, but even some of the most insidious invaders (e.g.: Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer, chestnut blight in North America) have not caused their host species to become extinct. Extirpation, population decline and homogenization of regional biodiversity are much more common. Human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species circumventing their barriers, by introducing them for food and other purposes. Human activities therefore allow species to migrate to new areas (and thus become invasive) occurred on time scales much shorter than historically have been required for a species to extend its range. At present, several countries have already imported so many",Wiki
Biogeochemical_cycle,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeochemical_cycle,"A biogeochemical cycle, or more generally a cycle of matter, is the movement and transformation of chemical elements and compounds between living organisms, the atmosphere, and the Earth's crust. Major biogeochemical cycles include the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle and the water cycle. In each cycle, the chemical element or molecule is transformed and cycled by living organisms and through various geological forms and reservoirs, including the atmosphere, the soil and the oceans. It can be thought of as the pathway by which a chemical substance cycles (is turned over or moves through) the biotic compartment and the abiotic compartments of Earth. The biotic compartment is the biosphere and the abiotic compartments are the atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere. For example, in the carbon cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants through photosynthesis, which converts it into organic compounds that are used by organisms for energy and growth. Carbon is then released back into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition. Additionally, carbon is stored in fossil fuels and is released into the atmosphere through human activities such as burning fossil fuels. In the nitrogen cycle, atmospheric nitrogen gas is converted by plants into usable forms such as ammonia and nitrates through the process of nitrogen fixation. These compounds can be used by other organisms, and nitrogen is returned to the atmosphere through denitrification and other processes. In the water cycle, the universal solvent water evaporates from land and oceans to form clouds in the atmosphere, and then precipitates back to different parts of the planet. Precipitation can seep into the ground and become part of groundwater systems used by plants and other organisms, or can runoff the surface to form lakes and rivers. Subterranean water can then seep into the ocean along with river discharges, rich with dissolved and particulate organic matter and other nutrients. There are biogeochemical cycles for many other elements, such as for oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorus, calcium, iron, sulfur, mercury and selenium. There are also cycles for molecules, such as water and silica. In addition there are macroscopic cycles such as the rock cycle, and human-induced cycles for synthetic compounds such as for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In some cycles there are geological reservoirs where substances can remain or be sequestered for long periods of time. Biogeochemical cycles involve the interaction of biological, geological, and chemical processes. Biological processes include the influence of microorganisms, which are critical drivers of biogeochemical cycling. Microorganisms have the ability to carry out wide ranges of metabolic processes essential for the cycling of nutrients (macronutrients and micronutrients) and chemicals throughout global ecosystems. Without microorganisms many of these processes would not occur, with significant impact on the functioning of land and ocean ecosystems and the planet's biogeochemical cycles as a whole. Changes to cycles can impact human health. The cycles are interconnected and play important roles regulating climate, supporting the growth of plants, phytoplankton and other organisms, and maintaining the health of ecosystems generally. Human activities such as burning fossil fuels and using large amounts of fertilizer can disrupt cycles, contributing to climate change, pollution, and other environmental problems. Energy flows directionally through ecosystems, entering as sunlight (or inorganic molecules for chemoautotrophs) and leaving as heat during the many transfers between trophic levels. However, the matter that makes up living organisms is conserved and recycled. The six most common elements associated with organic molecules — carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur — take a variety of chemical forms and may exist for long periods in the atmosphere, on land, in water, or beneath the Earth's surface. Geologic processes, such as weathering, erosion, water drainage, and the subduction of the continental plates, all play a role in this recycling of materials. Because geology and chemistry have major roles in the study of this process, the recycling of inorganic matter between living organisms and their environment is called a biogeochemical cycle. The six aforementioned elements are used by organisms in a variety of ways. Hydrogen and oxygen are found in water and organic molecules, both of which are essential to life. Carbon is found in all organic molecules, whereas nitrogen is an important component of nucleic acids and proteins. Phosphorus is used to make nucleic acids and the phospholipids that comprise biological membranes. Sulfur is critical to the three-dimensional shape of proteins. The cycling of these elements is interconnected. For example, the movement of water is critical for leaching sulfur and phosphorus into rivers which can then flow into oceans. Minerals cycle through the biosphere between the biotic and abiotic components and from one organism to another. Ecological systems (ecosystems) have many biogeochemical cycles operating as a part of the system, for example, the water cycle, the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, etc. All chemical elements occurring in organisms are part of biogeochemical cycles. In addition to being a part of living organisms, these chemical elements also cycle through abiotic factors of ecosystems such as water (hydrosphere), land (lithosphere), and/or the air (atmosphere). The living factors of the planet can be referred to collectively as the biosphere. All the nutrients — such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur — used in ecosystems by living organisms are a part of a closed system; therefore, these chemicals are recycled instead of being lost and replenished constantly such as in an open system. The major parts of the biosphere are connected by the flow of chemical elements and compounds in biogeochemical cycles. In many of these cycles, the biota plays an important role. Matter from the Earth's interior is released by volcanoes. The atmosphere exchanges some compounds and elements rapidly with the biota and oceans. Exchanges of materials between rocks, soils, and the oceans are generally slower by comparison. The flow of energy in an ecosystem is an open system; the Sun constantly gives the planet energy in the form of light while it is eventually used and lost in the form of heat throughout the trophic levels of a food web. Carbon is used to make carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, the major sources of food energy. These compounds are oxidized to release carbon dioxide, which can be captured by plants to make organic compounds. The chemical reaction is powered by the light energy of sunshine. Sunlight is required to combine carbon with hydrogen and oxygen into an energy source, but ecosystems in the deep sea, where no sunlight can penetrate, obtain energy from sulfur. Hydrogen sulfide near hydrothermal vents can be utilized by organisms such as the giant tube worm. In the sulfur cycle, sulfur can be forever recycled as a source of energy. Energy can be released through the oxidation and reduction of sulfur compounds (e.g., oxidizing elemental sulfur to sulfite and then to sulfate). Although the Earth constantly receives energy from the Sun, its chemical composition is essentially fixed, as the additional matter is only occasionally added by meteorites. Because this chemical composition is not replenished like energy, all processes that depend on these chemicals must be recycled. These cycles include both the living biosphere and the nonliving lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. Biogeochemical cycles can be contrasted with geochemical cycles. The latter deals only with crustal and subcrustal reservoirs even though some process from both overlap. The global ocean covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface and is remarkably heterogeneous. Marine productive areas, and coastal ecosystems comprise a minor fraction of the ocean in terms of surface area, yet have an enormous impact on global biogeochemical cycles carried out by microbial communities, which represent 90% of the ocean's biomass. Work in recent years has largely focused on cycling of carbon and macronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicate: other important elements such as sulfur or trace elements have been less studied, reflecting associated technical and logistical issues. Increasingly, these marine areas, and the taxa that form their ecosystems, are subject to significant anthropogenic pressure, impacting marine life and recycling of energy and nutrients. A key example is that of cultural eutrophication, where agricultural runoff leads to nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment of coastal ecosystems, greatly increasing productivity resulting in algal blooms, deoxygenation of the water column and seabed, and increased greenhouse gas emissions, with direct local and global impacts on nitrogen and carbon cycles. However, the runoff of organic matter from the mainland to coastal ecosystems is just one of a series of pressing threats stressing microbial communities due to global change. Climate change has also resulted in changes in the cryosphere, as glaciers and permafrost melt, resulting in intensified marine stratification, while shifts of the redox-state in different biomes are rapidly reshaping microbial assemblages at an unprecedented rate. Global change is, therefore, affecting key processes including primary productivity, CO2 and N2 fixation, organic matter respiration/remineralization, and the sinking and burial deposition of fixed CO2. In addition to this, oceans are experiencing an acidification process, with a change of ~0.1 pH units between the pre-industrial period and today, affecting carbonate/bicarbonate buffer chemistry. In turn, acidification has been reported to impact planktonic communities, principally through effects on calcifying taxa. There is also evidence for shifts in the production of key intermediary volatile products, some of which have marked greenhouse effects (e.g., N2O and CH4, reviewed by Breitburg in 2018, due to the increase in global temperature, ocean stratification and deoxygenation, driving as much as 25 to 50% of nitrogen loss from the ocean to the atmosphere in the so-called oxygen minimum zones or anoxic marine zones, driven by microbial processes. Other products, that are typically toxic for the marine nekton, including reduced sulfur species such as H2S, have a negative impact for marine resources like fisheries and coastal aquaculture. While global change has accelerated, there has been a parallel increase in awareness of the complexity of marine ecosystems, and especially the fundamental role of microbes as drivers of ecosystem functioning. Microorganisms drive much of the biogeochemical cycling in the earth system. The chemicals are sometimes held for long periods of time in one place. This place is called a reservoir, which, for example, includes such things as coal deposits that are storing carbon for a long period of time. When chemicals are held for only short periods of time, they are being held in exchange pools. Examples of exchange pools include plants and animals. Plants and animals utilize carbon to produce carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, which can then be used to build their internal structures or to obtain energy. Plants and animals temporarily use carbon in their systems and then release it back into the air or surrounding medium. Generally, reservoirs are abiotic factors whereas exchange pools are biotic factors. Carbon is held for a relatively short time in plants and animals in comparison to coal deposits. The amount of time that a chemical is held in one place is called its residence time or turnover time (also called the renewal time or exit age). Box models are widely used to model biogeochemical systems. Box models are simplified versions of complex systems, reducing them to boxes (or storage reservoirs) for chemical materials, linked by material fluxes (flows). Simple box models have a small number of boxes with properties, such as volume, that do not change with time. The boxes are assumed to behave as if they were mixed homogeneously. These models are often used to derive analytical formulas describing the dynamics and steady-state abundance of the chemical species involved. The diagram at the right shows a basic one-box model. The reservoir contains the amount of material M under consideration, as defined by chemical, physical or biological properties. The source Q is the flux of material into the reservoir, and the sink S is the flux of material out of the reservoir. The budget is the check and balance of the sources and sinks affecting material turnover in a reservoir. The reservoir is in a steady state if Q = S, that is, if the sources balance the sinks and there is no change over time. The residence or turnover time is the average time material spends resident in the reservoir. If the reservoir is in a steady state, this is the same as the time it takes to fill or drain the reservoir. Thus, if τ is the turnover time, then τ = M/S. The equation describing the rate of change of content in a reservoir is When two or more reservoirs are connected, the material can be regarded as cycling between the reservoirs, and there can be predictable patterns to the cyclic flow. More complex multibox models are usually solved using numerical techniques. Global biogeochemical box models usually measure: The diagram on the left shows a simplified budget of ocean carbon flows. It is composed of three simple interconnected box models, one for the euphotic zone, one for the ocean interior or dark ocean, and one for ocean sediments. In the euphotic zone, net phytoplankton production is about 50 Pg C each year. About 10 Pg is exported to the ocean interior while the other 40 Pg is respired. Organic carbon degradation occurs as particles (marine snow) settle through the ocean interior. Only 2 Pg eventually arrives at the seafloor, while the other 8 Pg is respired in the dark ocean. In sediments, the time scale available for degradation increases by orders of magnitude with the result that 90% of the organic carbon delivered is degraded and only 0.2 Pg C yr−1 is eventually buried and transferred from the biosphere to the geosphere. The diagram on the right shows a more complex model with many interacting boxes. Reservoir masses here represents carbon stocks, measured in Pg C. Carbon exchange fluxes, measured in Pg C yr−1, occur between the atmosphere and its two major sinks, the land and the ocean. The black numbers and arrows indicate the reservoir mass and exchange fluxes estimated for the year 1750, just before the Industrial Revolution. The red arrows (and associated numbers) indicate the annual flux changes due to anthropogenic activities, averaged over the 2000–2009 time period. They represent how the carbon cycle has changed since 1750. Red numbers in the reservoirs represent the cumulative changes in anthropogenic carbon since the start of the Industrial Period, 1750–2011. There are fast and slow biogeochemical cycles. Fast cycle operate in the biosphere and slow cycles operate in rocks. Fast or biological cycles can complete within years, moving substances from atmosphere to biosphere, then back to the atmosphere. Slow or geological cycles can take millions of years to complete, moving substances through the Earth's crust between rocks, soil, ocean and atmosphere. As an example, the fast carbon cycle is illustrated in the diagram below on the left. This cycle involves relatively short-term biogeochemical processes between the environment and living organisms in the biosphere. It includes movements of carbon between the atmosphere and terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as well as soils and seafloor sediments. The fast cycle includes annual cycles involving photosynthesis and decadal cycles involving vegetative growth and decomposition. The reactions of the fast carbon cycle to human activities will determine many of the more immediate impacts of climate change. The slow cycle is illustrated in the diagram above on the right. It involves medium to long-term geochemical processes belonging to the rock cycle. The exchange between the ocean and atmosphere can take centuries, and the weathering of rocks can take millions of years. Carbon in the ocean precipitates to the ocean floor where it can form sedimentary rock and be subducted into the Earth's mantle. Mountain building processes result in the return of this geologic carbon to the Earth's surface. There the rocks are weathered and carbon is returned to the atmosphere by degassing and to the ocean by rivers. Other geologic carbon returns to the ocean through the hydrothermal emission of calcium ions. In a given year between 10 and 100 million tonnes of carbon moves around this slow cycle. This includes volcanoes returning geologic carbon directly to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. However, this is less than one percent of the carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. The terrestrial subsurface is the largest reservoir of carbon on earth, containing 14–135 Pg of carbon and 2–19% of all biomass. Microorganisms drive organic and inorganic compound transformations in this environment and thereby control biogeochemical cycles. Current knowledge of the microbial ecology of the subsurface is primarily based on 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences. Recent estimates show that <8% of 16S rRNA sequences in public databases derive from subsurface organisms and only a small fraction of those are represented by genomes or isolates. Thus, there is remarkably little reliable information about microbial metabolism in the subsurface. Further, little is known about how organisms in subsurface ecosystems are metabolically interconnected. Some cultivation-based studies of syntrophic consortia and small-scale metagenomic analyses of natural communities suggest that organisms are linked via metabolic handoffs: the transfer of redox reaction products of one organism to another. However, no complex environments have been dissected completely enough to resolve the metabolic interaction networks that underpin them. This restricts the ability of biogeochemical models to capture key aspects of the carbon and other nutrient cycles. New approaches such as genome-resolved metagenomics, an approach that can yield a comprehensive set of draft and even complete genomes for organisms without the requirement for laboratory isolation have the potential to provide this critical level of understanding of biogeochemical processes. Some of the more well-known biogeochemical cycles are shown below: Many biogeochemical cycles are currently being studied for the first time. Climate change and human impacts are drastically changing the speed, intensity, and balance of these relatively unknown cycles, which include: Biogeochemical cycles always involve active equilibrium states: a balance in the cycling of the element between compartments. However, overall balance may involve compartments distributed on a global scale. As biogeochemical cycles describe the movements of substances on the entire globe, the study of these is inherently multidisciplinary. The carbon cycle may be related to research in ecology and atmospheric sciences. Biochemical dynamics would also be related to the fields of geology and pedology.",Wiki
